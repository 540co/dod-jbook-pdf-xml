It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.\n\n     The Bio\/Info\/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro\/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple biological architectures and functions, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. \n\n     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems. The project is exploring novel means of exploiting computer capabilities, including: practical, logical, heuristic, and automated reasoning by machines; development of enhanced human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; innovative approaches to the composition of software; innovative computer architectures; mathematical programs and their potential for defense applications; and new learning mechanisms for systematically upgrading and improving these capabilities.\n\n      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cybersecurity.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.\n\n     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.\n\n     The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the development of advanced nanoscale and bio-molecular materials, devices, and electronics for DoD applications that greatly enhance soldier awareness, capability, security, and survivability, such as materials with increased strength-to-weight ratio and ultra-low size, devices with ultra-low energy dissipation and power, and electronics with persistent intelligence and improved surveillance capabilities.\n\n     The Transformative Sciences project supports scientific research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in the areas of computing and the computing-reliant subareas of social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce as a means of improving military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging converging trends."

An important focus of this program will be determining how information is stored and recalled in the brain and other DoD-relevant signals and developing predictive, quantitative models of learning, memory, and measurement.  Using this understanding, the program will develop powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that will provide the ability to understand complex and evolving signals and tasks while decreasing software and hardware requirements and other measurement resources.  This includes a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels, which would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation will enable these advances.  This program will further exploit advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to improve training of individuals and teams as well as identify new therapies for cognitive rehabilitation (e.g., TBI, PTSD).  Critical to success will be the ability to detect cellular and network-level changes produced in the brain during the formation of new, hierarchically organized memories and memory classes, and to correlate those changes with memory function of animals during performance of behavioral tasks."

The objective of the UPSIDE program is to create a high-level, non-Boolean computational model and map it directly to the unique functional properties of new emerging devices to achieve significant increases in power efficiency and performance.  The UPSIDE program will create a new generation of computing structures that will, in turn, enable revolutionary advances in ISR processing, particularly for DoD applications of embedded, real-time sensor data analysis.  Boolean data representations are inherently power-inefficient for many datasets, particularly those produced by noisy analog real-time sensors.  The UPSIDE program will establish an unconventional, non-Boolean, computing paradigm to enable new and needed capabilities in the area of sensor data analysis.\n\nUPSIDE intends to implement this new computing paradigm in the form of a specialized hardware component termed the inference module (IM).  The inference module will be first developed through simulation, and then implemented using mixed-signal complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, as well as using state of the art emerging (non-CMOS) devices.  Throughout the program, the inference module will be benchmarked using a DoD-relevant image processing pipeline, to verify gains in both computing throughput and power efficiency.  The result will be computing infrastructures and functional implementations that demonstrate three orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed and four orders of magnitude improvement in power efficiency.  These gains will constitute a disruptive new level of embedded computational efficiency for future real-time sensor systems."

The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and National Security issues.  Beginning in 2013, YFA technical topic areas are more closely tied to programs currently underway at DARPA and to recently identified DoD and National Security needs.  The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers, and the user community.  Current activities include research in thirteen topic areas spanning from Quantum Science and Technology to Robotics and Supervised Autonomy, Mathematics, Computing, and the Interface of Engineering and Biology.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs."

Recent evidence has shown that social network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD-relevant scenarios.  In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set that characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time."

This capability will increase the number of people who can effectively contribute, will make experts more productive, and will enable the creation of new tactical applications that are inconceivable given today's tools.  The key enabling technology is a new programming paradigm called probabilistic programming that facilitates the management of uncertain information.  In this approach, developers will use the power of a modern (probabilistic) programming language to quickly build a generative model of the phenomenon of interest as well as queries of interest, which a compiler will convert into an efficient application.  PPAML technologies will be designed for application to a wide range of military domains including ISR exploitation, robotic and autonomous system navigation and control, weather prediction, and medical diagnostics."

Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract yet predictive - ideally causal - models from massive volumes of diverse data generated by human actors, physical sensors, and networked devices.  Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models is growing exponentially and has now, or will soon, exceed the capacity for human comprehension.  Big Mechanism will create technologies to extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases readily adapted to novel problem scenarios; powerful reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations, apply general rules to specific instances, and generate (and compute the likelihood of) the most plausible explanations for a sequence of events; and knowledge synthesis techniques to derive abstract principles and\/or create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data.  Big Mechanism applications will accommodate an operator-in-the-loop by accepting questions posed in human natural language; providing drill-down to reveal the basis for an answer; taking user inputs to improve\/correct derived associations, weightings, and conclusions; and querying the operator to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies.  Big Mechanism techniques will integrate burgeoning data into causal models and explore these models for precise interventions in critical areas such as cancer modeling, systems biology, epidemiology, cyber attribution, open-source intelligence, economic indications and warning, and human-social-cultural-behavioral modeling.

The scale and complexity of modern information systems obscures linkages between security-related events, the result being that detection of attacks and anomalies must rely on narrow contextual information rather than full knowledge of the event's provenance.  This shortcoming facilitates attacks such as masquerade (at the user level) and mimicry (at the machine code level).  Conversely, the space of security policies that can be enforced under the current operating paradigm is extremely narrow and restrictive; to the extent that users and administrators are required to make security decisions based on limited information, the default is often to just click through.  The Transparent Computing program will pursue several promising approaches to these problems, including active\/continuous testing via cooperating defenses, where protection components propagate security-relevant information and enable on-the-fly adaptation of the system security posture and usage controls, and behavior attestation techniques that ensure component interactions are consistent with established behavior profiles without exhaustive enumeration of all acceptable program states.  Transparent Computing technologies are particularly important for large integrated systems with diverse components such as distributed surveillance systems, autonomous systems, and enterprise information systems."

Because some questions can be answered only by subject matter experts, collaborators will be asked to answer a question if they can and otherwise to forward the question.  Tracking these exchanges will enable the computer to learn to send questions directly to the right subject matter experts in the future.  As knowledge is acquired, some computers will specialize and become subject matter experts themselves while other computers will become directories of experts that can provide guidance about where to find knowledge.  When enough computers have compiled enough knowledge, humans will start to access them by the same mechanism that the computers use: by asking questions.  A major technical challenge concerns the formalism in which questions and answers are posed.  Human languages will be adequate for some questions, but sometimes mathematics or pictures or other formalisms will be required."

However, there is a processing structure in nature, the mammalian neocortex, that efficiently captures spatial and temporal structure and routinely solves the most difficult recognition problems in real-time and is a general purpose structure for a range of sensor data processing and motor control execution.  The Cortical Processor program will leverage simplified models of known cortical operation to develop a new processor architecture that is optimized for running a family of algorithms known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), providing new levels of performance and capabilities to a broad range of data recognition problems.  HTM models map well to simple, massively parallel, signal processor arrays, and a cortical processor leveraging advances in dense memory structures on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip running at a few watts can perform orders of magnitude larger tasks than HTM systems simulated by commercial efforts on large data-center clusters.  And with certain specialized circuits, several orders of magnitude improvement in throughput and efficiency will be possible with the cortical processor, enabling a wide range of powerful, ultra-low power, embedded applications.\n\nThe Cortical Processor program includes basic scientific exploration into a variety of topics central to the development of this fundamentally new computing methodology.  The ultimate goal of the Cortical Processor program is to fabricate an accelerator\/coprocessor, in silicon, that contains thousands of reconfigurable, interconnected HTM modules.  HTM algorithm and data representation research will be conducted to determine optimal implementation to efficiently utilize the collective operation of the individual modules to achieve the unique features and functionality required by the cortical processor.  Each of the cortical processor modules will communicate with a large subset of other nodes requiring development of dense interconnect technology and research into a variety of on-chip network optimizations for the architecture to achieve the connectivity required.  Opportunities for significant improvements in power efficiency and speed will be achieved by leveraging recent advances in dense memory structures, such as multi-level floating gates, processors in memory, or 3D integration.  Applied research for the program is budgeted in PE 0602303E, Project IT-02."

SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.  SSIM will develop the requisite training technology, including advanced gaming\/simulation techniques, that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices.  SSIM will enhance military effectiveness by enabling close collaborative relationships with local peoples and leaders."

In addition, the structure will accommodate the notion that data acquisition and information processing are coupled, requiring some degree of feedback and control, while simultaneously admitting the possibility of different logics, such as those that allow for incomplete and time-varying states of knowledge.  The result of this effort will produce advances in fundamental domains of mathematics with the potential to reshape current DoD approaches to managing the battlespace."

Networked computing systems control significant elements of critical national infrastructure, from power plants and energy distribution grids, transportation systems, food and water distribution systems, and financial networks to defense systems.  During the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal\/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and lone miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number.  The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD resilience in the face of adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area.  Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects."

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, high carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two- and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems are demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.\n\nThe Basic Research part of this effort is focused on fundamental MPD research and will advance scientific knowledge based on the study of several key MPD design parameters.  These parameters include ultra-high pressure and high carrier density regimes.  MPD will focus on expanding the design space for plasma devices enabling revolutionary advances in micro-plasma device performance.  It is expected that MPD will develop innovative concepts and technologies that are clearly disruptive with respect to the current state of the art in terms of speed of operation and robustness in extreme environments.  Fundamental scientific knowledge derived from MPD is also expected to drive developments in commercialization of MPD technology developed and funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

Efforts under this program will remove the roadblocks to achieving performance needed for future sensing, communication, computing, and memory applications.  The program involves close collaboration between these experts and the academic base with industry providing 60% of program funding matched by 40% from DARPA.  For both industrial and government participants, leveraging shared research funding for high risk, pre-competitive technology explorations for shared technical hurdles is very attractive.\n\nResearch in STARNet is divided into a discovery thrust (ACCEL) and an integration thrust (NEXT) executed by virtual academic centers and focused on combining current or emerging technologies to provide new capabilities.  ACCEL seeks to discover new material systems, devices, and novel computing\/sensing architectures.  NEXT involves projects on advanced analog and mixed signal circuitry, complex system design tools, and alternative computing architectures.  As the projects in ACCEL mature, it is expected that they will replace the efforts in NEXT that are based on current standard technologies for integrated circuits.\n\nThe STARNet program is unique.  It creates a community where industry and government participate as co-sponsors to guide and learn from a large academic research base, with DoD shaping the goals to have direct impact on important long-range DoD problems."

The DoD relies heavily on phased arrays to maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  The DoD cannot update these high cost specialized arrays at the pace necessary to effectively counter adversarial threats under development using commercial-of-the-shelf components that can undergo technology refresh far more frequently.  The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays.  New advances in digital circuits at every element in an array panel will allow for ubiquitous phased array technology with heretofore unrealized spectral coverage and capabilities.  This program will take a fundamental look at the role of digital arrays and how commonality and aggregation can be affected by emerging capabilities.  Simultaneously, this effort will focus on the development of arrays which can quickly create different unique RF personalities\/capabilities on top of common digital hardware.  The project will demonstrate levels of diversity in the use of the electromagnetic spectrum which are severely limited by the current approach of hand-designing the array with heavily specialized RF beamformers that are unique to each system.

It is well known that the sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the-art cryo-coolers are their large size, high power and high cost.  Thermoelectric (TE) coolers are relatively small, but are very power hungry.\n\nTo reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thomson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, for making IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C.  MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.

The performance of such devices is limited, in part, by the architecture and geometry of the sensing configuration and by thermal noise both in the device and the signal recovery electronics.  Advances in co-integration of micro-optical and MEMS technologies enable new hybrid opto-mechanical architectures for improved performance of MEMS devices.\n\nThe ORCHID program leveraged recent successes within the field of cavity-opto-mechanics to explore the fundamental physics of opto-mechanical interactions on the micro-scale while driving technological development toward smaller and more robust devices capable of field deployment.  It is envisioned that such devices will find broad application across DoD, particularly in the areas of microwave generation, force sensing, and optical communications."

Examples of physical effects that have been investigated under this thrust include absorption thermodynamics in metal-hydride systems, and correlated electron effects such as superconductivity and magnetism.  This thrust has also included investigations of the phenomenology of various biological, physical, and social systems in order to abstract the common features that are responsible for their properties of self-organization, emergent behavior, and physical intelligence.

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e. those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms) leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g. fluoropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g. self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to facilitate new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains that are vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.\n\nIf successful, Living Foundries will do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry: enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, develops and yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction, and standardization of both processes and components.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design and modeling; automated, modular and standardized fabrication and genome-scale engineering processes; modular regulatory elements, devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation, and debugging.  Applied research for this program is budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02."

The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and\/or sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor\/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field.  VAPR will build out an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient beacon.  \n\nA basis set of transient materials and electronic components with sufficient electronic and transience performance is needed to realize transient electronic systems for environmental sensing and biomedical applications.  Research and development of novel materials for implementing basic transient electronic components (actives and passives), power supply strategies, substrates and encapsulants as well as development of modes and triggers for transience will form the core of fundamental research activities.  Transient components and devices developed in this technical area will form the basis for advanced functional circuit blocks and test systems to be developed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

Engineering biology is emerging as a new field focused on developing the tools to harness the powerful synthetic and functional capabilities of biology.  These tools will facilitate design and biological production of new chemicals and materials, sensing capabilities, therapeutics, and numerous other applications.  This rapidly developing technological capability opens the door to new national security applications that have heretofore been out of reach, and offers substantial potential advantages in terms of cost and novel functionality.  The ACE program will position the U.S. to be first in exploiting the powerful functional capabilities and applications that arise through being able to harness biological systems.\n\nA major impediment to engineering biology is that engineered organisms are often less fit than their precursors and are likely to be outcompeted by other organisms.  Fundamental work in this area will focus on engineering biological robustness to ensure that engineered organisms perform as designed over the long-term.  Research in this area may include developing methods to ensure genetic integrity of organisms, as well as engineering communities of microorganisms to perform useful tasks, ranging from the production of chemicals to the development of stable microbiomes to prevent and treat disease.\n."

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in taking care of the warfighter such as blast-induced traumatic brain injury.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation, and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis."

Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation, and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis."

This will require an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation.  Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which the brain utilizes sensory inputs to plan and execute behavioral outputs, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances will enable restoration of sensorimotor function through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain will progress to an unprecedented level with this novel approach.  A key aspect of this effort will be to develop non-destructive neuronal imaging and control techniques that are capable of rapid analysis and interpretation of brain tissue alterations at the cellular scale.  Additional research under this effort will generate new methodologies to understand the structural and functional relationships between individual neurons through direct, high-resolution, optical imaging of neuron populations of interest as well as the entire brain."

ADEPT will develop and exploit synthetic biology for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01."

The goal of this program was to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal required significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.  Additionally, the device may be effective as a medical countermeasure against various chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins.\n\nInitial basic research developed the component technologies that will ultimately make up the integrated device.  Included in this effort was the development of non-fouling continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; design of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; development of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01."

Bio-warfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect evolution of natural and engineered emerging pathogen threats, and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to development of detection devices that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies include a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze large amounts of data and provide tools to make better-informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics."

Bio-warfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect evolution of natural and engineered emerging pathogen threats, and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to development of detection devices that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies include a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze large amounts of data and provide tools to make better-informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics."

Additionally, ADEPT will develop methods to transiently deliver nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, and kinetically control the timing and levels of gene expression so that these drugs will be safe and effective for use in healthy subjects.  ADEPT will also focus on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.  A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01."

This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional, and cellular-level interactions.  Finally, this thrust will allow safe, non-invasive to minimally invasive detection of microscopic and functional alterations within tissues and organs of a living organism at early stages of injury.  The advanced development of these tools will provide a formidable arsenal of diagnostic tools for warfighter performance and care."

The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.  Additionally, the device may be effective as a medical countermeasure against various chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins.\n\nApplied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.  The basic research part of this program is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01."

The Warrior Web program will mitigate that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system will be compliant and transparent to the user, it will reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.  Success in this program will require the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power\/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution\/energy storage.  The final system is planned to weigh no more than 9kg and require no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform missions with reduced risk of injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance, and the long-term health of our veterans."

This program will also develop neural interface hardware for monitoring and modulating neural activity responsible for successful memory formation in a human clinical population.  The ultimate goal is identification of efficacious therapeutics or other therapies that can bypass and\/or recover the neural functions underlying memory, which are often disrupted as a consequence of TBI.

One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program will specifically examine the networks of neurons involved in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this thrust include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression."

These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include supercomputer, embedded computing systems, and novel design tools for manufacturing of defense systems.\n\n     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the technology required to make emerging information system capabilities (such as wireless and mobile code\/mobile systems) inherently secure, and to protect DoD's mission-critical systems against attack upon or through the supporting information infrastructure.  These technologies will enable our critical systems to provide continuous correct operation even when they are attacked, and will lead to generations of stronger protection, higher performance, and more cost-effective security and survivability solutions scalable to several thousand sites.  \n\n     The Language Technology project will develop and test powerful new Human Language Technology that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs.  This technology will enable systems to a) automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means; b) to have two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation; c) enable automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization; and d) enable exploitation of captured, foreign language hard-copy documents.\n\n     The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems.  This involves networking, people, platforms, weapons sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The results are networked forces that operate with increased speed and synchronization and are capable of achieving massed effects without the physical massing of forces as required in the past."

This is a challenge for embedded applications, from Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems on unmanned air vehicles through combat and control systems on submarines.

However, there is a processing structure in nature, the mammalian neocortex, that efficiently captures spatial and temporal structure and routinely solves the most difficult recognition problems in real-time and is a general purpose structure for a range of sensor data processing and motor control execution.  The Cortical Processor program will leverage simplified models of known cortical operation to develop a new processor architecture that is optimized for running a family of algorithms known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), providing new levels of performance and capabilities to a broad range of data recognition problems.  HTM models map well to simple, massively parallel, signal processor arrays and a cortical processor leveraging advances in dense memory structures on a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) chip running at a few watts can perform orders of magnitude larger tasks than an HTM system simulated by commercial efforts on large data-center clusters.  With certain specialized circuits, several orders of magnitude improvement in throughput and efficiency will be possible with the cortical processor, enabling a wide range of powerful, ultra-low power, embedded applications.\n\nExecuting large HTM models on modest-sized embedded platforms will transform the DoD's ability to convert huge quantities of data into actionable information.  By augmenting tactical sensor systems on the battlefield with the new functionalities of predictive analyses and anomaly detection, this technology will have a major impact on the abilities of autonomous vehicles, robots, and UAVs.  The Cortical Processor will adapt to changing environments while reducing the need for a man in-the-loop, providing entirely new capabilities that cannot be achieved with today's commercial hardware.  This technology will enable more complex missions, particularly for surveillance systems and portable analytics and knowledge extraction from vision sensors and multi-model integration for the DoD and intelligence communities.  Basic research for the program is budgeted in PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02."

Such a \"fab-less\" design approach is complemented by a foundry-style manufacturing capability, consisting of a factory capable of rapid reconfiguration between a large number of products and product variants through bitstream re-programmability, with minimal or no resultant learning curve effects. Together, the fab-less design and foundry-style manufacturing capability is anticipated to yield substantial---by a factor of five ---compression in the time to develop and field complex defense and aerospace systems."

The iFAB vision is to move away from wrapping a capital-intensive manufacturing facility around a single defense product, and toward the creation of a flexible, programmable, potentially distributed production capability able to accommodate a wide range of systems and system variants with extremely rapid reconfiguration timescales.  The specific goals of the iFAB program are to rapidly design and configure manufacturing capabilities to support the fabrication of a wide array of infantry fighting vehicle models and variants.\n\nOnce a given design is developed and verified, iFAB aims to take the formal design representation and automatically configure a digitally-programmable manufacturing facility, including the selection of participating manufacturing facilities and equipment, the sequencing of the product flow and production steps, and the generation of computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) machine instruction sets as well as human instructions and training modules.  iFAB is mostly an information architecture.  Only the final assembly capability needs to be co-located under a single roof in anything resembling a conventional fabrication facility; the rest of iFAB can be geographically distributed and can extend across corporate and industrial boundaries, united only by a common model architecture and certain rules of behavior and business practices.  The final assembly node of the iFAB Foundry for infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) is the Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (JMTC) at the Rock Island Arsenal (RIA)."

The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications."

Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.  Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH will develop techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time."

SAFER is also developing technology for performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first through fully homomorphic encryption and interactive, secure multi-party computation schemes.  This will enable, for example, the capability to encrypt queries and compute an encrypted search result without decrypting the query.  This technology will advance the capability to run programs on untrusted hardware while keeping programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential.

However, the DoD consumes a very small percentage of the total IC production in the world.  As a result of the globalization of the IC marketplace, much of the advanced IC production has moved to offshore foundries, and these parts make up the majority of ICs used in today's military systems.\n\nWithout the ability to influence and regulate the off-shore fabrication of ICs, there is a risk that parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet stated specifications for performance and reliability.  This risk increases considerably with the proliferation of counterfeit ICs in the marketplace, as well as the potential for the introduction of malicious circuits into a design.\n\nThe Integrity and Reliability of Integrated CircuitS (IRIS) program seeks to develop techniques that will provide electronic system developers the ability to validate the function of digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs non-destructively, given limited data about the chip's detailed design  specifications.  These techniques will include advanced imaging for identification of functional elements in deep sub-micrometer Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, as well as computational methods to deal with the extremely difficult problem of determining device connectivity.\n\nFinally, the IRIS program will develop innovative methods to determine the reliability of an IC by testing a limited number of samples.  The current understanding of IC aging mechanisms, including negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and electromigration (EM) will be leveraged to develop unique diagnostic test techniques."

Detection of counterfeit components by current means is expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness. Maintaining complete control of the supply chain using administrative controls incurs substantial costs and has limitations. Current methods of detection involve a wide variety of techniques ranging from functional testing to physical inspections which may still miss certain classes of counterfeits.  There have also been attempts by the semiconductor market to protect electronic components through the use of technology embedded in the component or its packaging.  However, most methods are specific to a manufacturer's component and as such address only those issues deemed critical to that manufacturer. Some methods can be circumvented, or require slow, expensive, off-site forensic analysis to verify authenticity.\n\nThe Supply Chain Hardware Intercepts for Electronics Defense (SHIELD) program, leveraging and expanding on previous activities in the IRIS program, will develop a technology capable of confirming, at any time, the authenticity of once-trusted parts, even after they have transited a complex global supply chain.  SHIELD will prevent counterfeit component substitution by incorporating a small, inexpensive additional silicon chip (\"dielet\") within the Integrated Circuit (IC) package. The dielet will provide a unique and non-clonable ID as well as anti-tamper features.  The microscopic-size dielet embedded in the electronic component packaging will be inductively powered and scanned by an authentication induction coil brought into very close proximity to the packaged chip, thus allowing for verification of chip identity."

In the civilian sphere, there is a recognized need for technologies that limit the sharing of information between commercial entities and U.S. government agencies to the greatest extent possible consistent with national security requirements.  Similarly, the U.S. military is increasingly involved in humanitarian operations that require highly selective sharing of data with a heterogeneous mix of allies, coalition partners, and other stakeholders.  AIAC will create confidentiality, privacy, multi-level security, discretionary access control, and policy engine technologies to allow tailored access to a specific datum but not an entire database\/file system\/corpus.  AIAC is timely due to recent progress on cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation.  Additional technologies that will be developed and incorporated include automated policy-driven releasability assessment and redaction, tactical obfuscation, and time-limited-access controls.  The program will address the diverse and stringent legal and ethical requirements related to security, privacy, authentication, authorization, auditing, monitoring, access, and control encountered in both civilian and military environments.  To facilitate deployment, AIAC technologies will be designed to work with the virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networking technologies now widely used in both civilian and military environments."

The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means.  Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples.  Warfighters need speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with local populations, especially two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation.  In addition, foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes, and activities.  Language translation, information extraction, and other language analytic systems contribute to the development of critical intelligence and situational awareness.  Technologies for translation of informal genres (online discussion groups, messaging, and telephone conversation) of voice and text, as well as capabilities to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in near real-time will enhance situational awareness."

Historically, foreign language translation technology was geared toward formal content, like broadcast media and newswire, but did not address informal or dialectal genres.  BOLT is developing new approaches to automated language translation, human-machine multimodal dialogue, and language generation and applying these to informal genre such as online discussion groups, messaging, and telephone conversation.  BOLT will leverage the strengths of statistical and rule-based approaches to form hybrid machine translation techniques that are more robust to linguistic dialectal variation; develop new techniques for modeling word relationships, functions, and context; and utilize syntactic and semantic patterns to fill in the linguistic gaps inherent in conversational language and to accelerate statistical learning.  While Chinese and dialectal Arabic are the two languages addressed directly in BOLT, techniques developed for these two languages will have wide applicability to other languages and dialects.  BOLT will enable warfighters and military\/government personnel to readily communicate with coalition partners and local populations and will enhance intelligence through better exploitation of all language sources."

FLRR technologies will identify the commonalities between a newly-encountered low-resource language and high-resource languages and will identify language universals to rapidly re-purpose existing language technologies to the low-resource language.

Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA will incentivize competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies compete head-to-head."

The ability to reason, learn and adapt will raise computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. \n\nThe Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered.  These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self-reliance, self-adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention.\n\nThe Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.  This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces.  Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications."

A key objective is intelligent control of manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity.  Current manipulation systems have many limitations.  For example, while they perform well in certain mission environments, they have yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they require burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeds military users' desires.  ARM will create manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains including, but not limited to, counter-improvised explosive device, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction).  ARM will enable autonomous manipulation systems to surpass the performance level of remote manipulation systems that are controlled directly by a human operator."

Of particular importance is development of a new data synchronization architecture between the handhelds and the backend computing\/storage nodes.  Additionally, appropriate middleware services and libraries are being developed to facilitate shared capabilities such as map viewing, apps management, and collection of logs, usage statistics, and user feedback.  Apps, together with handhelds and networks, are tested in different training environments as well as in deployed environments.  Performance and usage are carefully tracked and user feedback collected to guide rapid enhancement of apps.  The effort is creating a military apps development community by reaching out to non-traditional performers and will explore new models for software acquisition based on end-user empowerment."

Existing approaches to deactivating warfare agents  are difficult to implement in non- and semi-permissive environments or are too slow\/expensive to achieve over large permissive environments.  These limitations coupled with the emergence of new, low cost technologies for producing chemical weapons drive a need for countermeasures that are simple and fast to implement and improve U.S. strategic response to emerging chemical threats.   Approaches to be considered under the Unconventional Approaches to CWD program include creation of catalysts to accelerate the hydrolysis of chemical agents, development of approaches utilizing smart-chemistry to achieve stand-off demilitarization, construction of a small rapid remediation approach for use in semi-permissive environments, and identification of drugs or antidotes designed to protect those demilitarizing chemical agents in semi-permissive environments."

One goal of this program is to develop new sensors and sensing networks that can economically and reliably provide wide area monitoring of radionuclide signatures.  Another goal is to investigate new therapies and decontamination strategies that can mitigate both the long- and short-term biophysical health impacts of exposure to ionizing radiation."

The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling Technology.\n\nThe Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as drag reduction, ship stability, hypersonic missiles, logistically friendly distributed lighting systems, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, vessels for estuary and riverine operations, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.\n\nThe Advanced Land Systems project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also explore novel design technologies for the manufacture of ground vehicles and new tools for systems assessments of emerging DARPA technologies.\n\nThe Advanced Tactical Technology project focuses on broad technology areas including: a) compact, efficient, frequency-agile, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers for infrared countermeasures, laser radar, holographic laser sensors, communications, and high-power laser applications; and b) new tactical systems for enhanced air vehicle survivability, precision optics, electronic warfare, and advanced air breathing weapons. \n\nAeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and\/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.\n\nThe Network Centric Enabling Technology project develops network-centric mission applications that integrate information arising from: 1) sensors and signal\/image processors; 2) collection platforms and weapon systems; 3) intelligence networks; and 4) open and other external sources.  Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data streams in tactically-relevant timeframes.  Processing here includes a number of critical steps including conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization.  Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon.  Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition."

By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional manned ship design constraints in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system."

Building upon and complimenting concepts for maritime situational awareness and ISR developed under the DASH program, budgeted in Project PE 0603766E\/NET-02, the UFP approach centers on pre-deploying deep-ocean nodes years in advance in forward operating areas which can be commanded from standoff to launch to the surface.  Advances in miniaturized sensors and processors, the explosive growth in the variety of small unmanned systems, and the advances in autonomy and networking all point toward highly-capable, yet affordable, distributed systems.  Currently, large numbers of distributed unmanned systems are not utilized in far-forward areas due to logistics and distance, the need for delivery platforms, and the associated latency for insertion.  The UFP program will remove this barrier to accelerate large-scale unmanned distributed applications and missions.  The presumption is that a wider range of technology options and system solutions will emerge when the barriers to deployment are removed."

Due to retreating Arctic ice in the coming decades there is an expectation for increased shipping traffic during the summer months, and increased interest in exploiting natural resources along the Arctic continental shelf.  This growth in activity will increase the strategic significance of the region, and will drive the need to ensure stability through effective regional monitoring.  The extreme environmental conditions of the Arctic may challenge the effectiveness of conventional technology to provide such monitoring.  As such, this program seeks to exploit unique physical attributes and emergent environmental trends in the Arctic to create surprising new capabilities, and will develop technologies for persistent and affordable sensing and communication both above and below the ice to ensure responsive operations and domain awareness."

This will be accomplished through development of core ground combat and tactical vehicle technologies related to platform mobility, survivability through agility, improved signature management, semi-automated crew functions, and improved overall platform\/unit tactical utility.  The GXV program will develop technologies at the subsystem to integrated platform level, along with performance demonstrated through fully capable concept vehicles.  A key program thread is pursuing platform technologies that allow extreme reductions in integrated system volume, weight, and crew while conserving crew survivability, improving deployability, and increasing force effectiveness.  The GXV program will support a systems engineering-based GXV architecture that enhances technology development at the component and subsystem level.  Modeling and simulation for technical analysis and evaluation, as well as operational assessments, will be included in the GXV effort."

The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  IS2 will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry.  The end result of the IS2 program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve one-on-one overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create a new Hybrid Squad unit."

The Robotics Fast Track program seeks to revolutionize robotics technologies by promoting non-traditional technical opportunities.  The program will create low-cost, high-utility robotic component solutions by engaging a novel performer community in research efforts that result in prototype systems and proofs of concept in months, at a fraction of the cost of traditional design processes.  The Robotics Fast Track program will engage numerous robotics related efforts across the spectrum of robotics professionals and enthusiasts, extending the existing performer base to include non-standard, cutting edge organizations and individuals throughout the robotics community.  The program will demonstrate the ability for robotics projects to be performed at an asymmetric advantage in time, cost, and contribution of the efforts in comparison to more traditional applied research areas.  This will apply to both performance of individual efforts and to the contracting required to engage performers in said efforts."

Such an achievement will represent a significant advance over the state of the art, as existing lasers in this wavelength range are bulky, highly inefficient, and expensive, as there are no available semiconductor lasers that can emit in the UV range <250nm. LUSTER will leverage lessons learned in growing high quality light emitting material from the Compact Mid-Ultraviolet Technology (CMUVT) program.

Petrel will fill the niche between conventional airlift and sealift through development of a new transportation mode capable of high speed operation across the surface\/air interface over water as well as terrain.  Technical approaches for rapid transport across the ocean and movement from the ship to the tactical battlefield will consider traditional and non-traditional aerodynamic and hydrodynamic concepts as well as innovative uses of existing technologies.

ALIAS intends to enable reduction of aircrew workload and\/or the number of onboard aircrew, to improve performance.  The program will develop hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interfacing with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems.  The program will also develop tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors.  To accomplish this, ALIAS will leverage recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS will culminate in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to two aircraft and execute simple missions.  This reliability enhancement capability will enable new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allow a reduction in the number of aircrew required."

The Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES) program will develop a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), modular unmanned air vehicle that can carry a 3,000 lb useful load at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  ARES will enable distributed operations and access to compact, high altitude landing zones to reduce warfighter exposure to hostile threats and bypass ground obstructions.  ARES modular capability allows for different mission modules to be quickly deployed at the company level.  This enables the flexible employment of the following capabilities: cargo resupply, casualty evacuation, reconnaissance, weapons platforms, and other types of operations.  The enabling technologies of interest include adaptive wing structures, ducted fan propulsion system, lightweight materials, and advanced flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  Additionally, the program will explore new adaptable landing gear concepts to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch\/recovery platforms.  ARES vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery, for evacuating injured personnel from difficult-to-access locations, or to resupply isolated small units.  ARES is well suited for enhanced company operations concepts which would provide the warfighter\/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.  Beginning in FY14, this program will be funded from PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01."

The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.

In contested environments, it is a challenge for command and control (C2) networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The Distributed Battle Management program will seek to develop a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture will enable rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintain a reliable C2 structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program will incorporate highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-on-the-loop operator approval."

In recent years we have seen how resource scarcity for necessities such as water and food can displace populations, destabilize nation-states, and precipitate global instability.  Such ethnic, political, societal, economic, and environmental stresses can often be observed in advance through open source economic and financial indicators, as expressed in market activities.  Market prices and volatility, which can be influenced by factors affecting production, transshipment, and\/or delivery, may also provide signals in advance of disruptive events.  Theoretically these signals can be a source of actionable information, but in practice it is difficult to generate useful intelligence due to the confounding effects of spurious signals and random noise.  The Quantitative Global Analytics program will combine quantitative analysis of global and regional economic and financial data with natural language processing, social network analysis, computational social science, and climate studies to filter out such confounding effects to produce real-time intelligence from a wide variety of international open source data.  The technologies developed in the Quantitative Global Analytics program will enhance situational awareness and generate indications and warning for new classes of cyber-social-economic-environmental threats."

Memex will create a new domain-specific search paradigm to discover relevant content and organize it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks.  In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines will extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content.  Memex technologies will enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories.  Anticipated mission areas include counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. government activities.

For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training\/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel\/funds transfers, etc.  Nexus 7 supports emerging military missions using both traditional and non-traditional data sources for those areas of the world and mission sets with limited conventional Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Examples of additional data sources include foreign news, media, and social network data.  These non-traditional sources will be integrated with a wide variety of military structured and unstructured data.  Nexus 7 will develop quantitative techniques and tools for processing and analyzing these large data sources as a means for understanding relationships between hostile, neutral, and friendly foreign organizations with the United States."

The EXACTO 50-caliber bullet and brass-board optical sighting technology greatly extends the day and night ranges over current state-of-the-art sniper systems allowing sniper teams to engage tactically important moving targets including accelerating vehicle-borne targets, in high crosswind conditions.  EXACTO enhances survivability by allowing greater shooter standoff range and reduced target engagement timelines.

Additionally, this project will develop new computational tools that link material properties to physics across multiple length scales (from molecule to part) in order to provide the ability to model and exploit complexity, such as hierarchy and strongly correlated effects, in structural and functional materials.  Examples of DoD applications that will benefit from these material developments include lower weight and higher performance aircraft, turbines with enhanced efficiency, erosion-resistant rotor blades, and high-temperature materials for operation in hypersonic environments."

Novel optical materials exploiting three-dimensional degrees of freedom to increase wavefront control, and flexible transparent displays are examples of materials in which design of structure at the scale of the critical phenomena can have significant impact on their performance.  To provide organic information, surveillance, and reconnaissance to the warfighter that greatly enhances awareness, security, and survivability, the capability for wearable (i.e., ultra-low size, weight, and power) systems with specific functionality will be developed.  These functions include holistic sensor integration, immersive telepresence, foveated imaging, remote reconnaissance and piloting, targeting assistance, and supplementary data overlay.  This thrust will also explore newly emerging areas where structure may play an important role."

The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools, and manufacturing processes will enable previously unattainable 3-D optical designs to be manufactured.  This new manufacturing paradigm will enable flexible production of GRIN optics in quantities of one unit to thousands of units."

The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class Submarine.  The Navy will evaluate this component in sea trials.  If successful, it is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement Submarines, and possibly back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class Submarines.  Beginning in FY2015 this program will be funded from PE 0603766E, Project NET-02, Maritime Systems."

Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making.  These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area will create modern neuroscientific techniques to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore physical and cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using physiological and neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense will be identified, developed, and evaluated.  This thrust area will have far-reaching implications for both current and future military operations, with the potential to protect and improve physical and cognitive performance at the individual and group level both prior to and during deployment."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e., those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms), leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g., fluoropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g., self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to enable new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices, and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.\n\nResearch thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms, or bioproduction pipelines, that integrate the tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E, TRS-01 to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems for novel materials.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Integrated processes developed in this program will translate into significant performance improvements and cost savings for the production of advanced materials, biological reporting systems, and therapeutics.  These technologies will ultimately result in on-demand, customizable, and distributed production of strategic materials and systems.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.

One approach to achieve this capability will require the development of new tools to stimulate and measure responses of the nervous system in order to map the bioelectric code that controls the immune response as well as other critical organ functions.  This program will also develop capabilities for serial measurements of metabolic state to identify correlates for health and early detection of disease.  An additional approach involves characterizing the host response in patients with severe infections, and translating this response into a quantitative framework that can be used to guide modulation of the immune response.  A further line of effort will pursue a detailed understanding of infectious diseases circulating in a community, with an aim to build capacity for the response to a crisis through managing current infectious disease challenges.  The effort will employ sophisticated laboratory testing to evaluate the evolution of pathogens.  Test beds in communities will be developed to evaluate the predictive algorithms by tracking infections in a community; influenza is an example of an infection that will be monitored.  Advances made under the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will improve our response capability against severe infectious diseases and biological threats and offer new avenues for treating disease with no available drugs, such as multiple drug resistant organisms.  The ultimate goals for the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program are to enable an autonomous and continuous sense and response capability to regulate the human immune response and to develop decision support tools that help manage infectious diseases in a community.  It is anticipated that these capabilities will ultimately provide enhanced protection against injury, enable life-saving rescue from hyper-immune activity, and stimulate advances in regenerative medicine."

The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.\n\nThe phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  Another thrust of the program element will explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices, new architectures to use them, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.  \n\nThis project has five major thrusts: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research."

The Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART) program will provide the warfighter with a new, fully adaptive radio platform capable of sensing the electromagnetic and waveform environment in which it operates, making decisions on how to best communicate in that environment, and rapidly adapting its hardware to meet ever-changing requirements, while simultaneously significantly reducing the SWaP of such radio nodes.  ART technology will also provide each warfighter, as well as small-scale unmanned platforms, with compact and efficient signal identification capabilities for next-generation cognitive communications, and sensing and electronic warfare applications.  ART technology will also enable rapid radio platform deployment for new waveforms and changing operational requirements.  The project will remove the separate design tasks needed for each unique Radio Frequency (RF) system, which will dramatically reduce the procurement and sustainment cost of military systems.  ART aggregates the Feedback Linearized Microwave Amplifiers program, the Analog Spectral Processing program, and Chip Scale Spectrum Analyzers (CSSA) program, and initiates new thrusts in Cognitive Low-energy Signal Analysis and Sensing Integrated Circuits (CLASIC), and Radio-Frequency Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (RF-FPGA)."

This technology will enable large voltage swing circuits for military applications that the current state-of-the-art silicon transistor technology cannot support.  The objective of the Nitride Electronic neXt-generation Technology (NEXT) program is to develop a revolutionary, wide band gap, nitride transistor technology that simultaneously provides extremely high-speed and high-voltage swing [Johnson Figure of Merit (JFoM) larger than 5 Terahertz (THz)-V] in a process consistent with large scale integration of enhancement\/depletion (E\/D) mode logic circuits of 1000 or more transistors.  In addition, this fabrication process will be reproducible, high-yield, high-uniformity, and highly reliable.  The accomplishment of this goal will be validated through the demonstration of specific program Process Control Monitor (PCM) Test Circuits such as 5, 51 and 501-stage ring oscillators in each program phase.  The impact of this next-generation nitride electronic technology will be the speed, linearity, and power efficiency improvement of RF and mixed-signal electronic circuits used in military communications, electronic warfare and sensing."

Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program enabled transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) to be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity\/density, respectively).  The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.  \n\nIn the Applied Research part of this program, high performance RF\/optoelectronic\/mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.  To provide maximum benefit to the DoD, these processes will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers.  Manufacturing yield and reliability of the DAHI technologies will be characterized and enhanced.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01, and advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15."

This suite of sensors, when integrated into an inertial measurement unit (IMU), will enable self-contained navigation and timing in the absence of signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS), due to environmental interference or adversary action such as GPS jamming.  The micro-PNT program is developing miniature high performance gyroscopes, accelerometers, and clocks, based on both solid state and atomic technologies.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques under development will enable the fabrication of a single package containing all the necessary devices in a volume the size of a sugar cube.  Co-location of atomic physics and MEMS-based devices opens the possibility for utilization of combinatorial algorithms to enable fast start-up time and increased bandwidth of MEMS with the long-term stability and accuracy of MEMS sensors, thus effectively providing very accurate navigation devices in highly dynamic environments.  The small SWaP+C of these technologies will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and individual soldiers.\n\nThe successful realization of micro-PNT depends on the development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of the error sources at the micro-scale, and understanding of scaling relationships for the size-reduction of sensors based on atomic physics techniques.  The micro-PNT program includes research into novel techniques for fabrication and integration of three-dimensional MEMS devices as well as theoretical and experimental studies of new MEMS architectures and geometries for inertial sensing.  Atomic physics research includes the development of new geometries and architectures for atomic inertial sensing and the development of techniques for improving the sensitivity and accuracy of miniaturized devices.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12."

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, high-carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems are demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.\n\nThe MPD applied research program is focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  It is expected that the MPD program will result in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale-plasma-device-based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications."

Successful completion of this program will raise chip heat removal rates to above 1 kilowatt\/cm^2 and chip package heat removal density to above 1kW\/cm^3 in RF arrays and embedded computers.\n\nSpecific areas of focus in this program include overcoming limiting evaporative and diffusive thermal transport mechanisms at the micro\/nano scale to provide an order-of-magnitude increase in on-chip heat flux and heat removal density, determining the feasibility of exploiting these mechanisms for intrachip thermal management, characterizing the performance limits and physics-of-failure of high heat density, intrachip cooling technologies, and integrating chip-level thermal management techniques into prototype high power electronics in RF arrays and embedded computing systems."

The vision of the program is to offer the warfighter a small and versatile infrared (IR) camera that would be affordable for individual soldiers and provide multiple IR band imagery with fusion capability to take full advantage of different wavelength-band phenomenology in a compact single unit.  In the future, the availability of the PIXNET camera would enable a peer-to-peer networked system for image sharing within a squad, thereby providing a better common operating picture of the battlefield and significantly enhancing the warfighter's situational understanding.  The program aims to develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP), low cost, soldier-portable multiband infrared camera that will provide real-time single and multiple band imagery using thermal and reflected-illumination bands.  The camera will also provide fused reflective and thermal band imagery on demand.  The use of fused imagery in the PIXNET design will allow the soldier to detect camouflaged targets and distinguish targets from decoys.  The PIXNET camera will eliminate limitations posed by current capability, allowing  detection, recognition and identification of targets whether in daylight or no-light conditions.\n\nThe PIXNET program will focus on a significant reduction in SWaP and cost of infrared sensor components to enable portability and ability to deploy widely to all participants in the theater.  The emphasis on a small form will naturally enable new opportunities such as surveillance with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)s, rifle sights with multiple bands, and vehicle-mounted, helmet-mounted and handheld surveillance systems.  The phenomenology of different infrared wavelengths will be exploited.  The combination of a smart phone and PIXNET camera at the soldier level will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) over the current capability.  The PIXNET program takes advantage of the computing capability of smart phones to process and fuse multicolor images and send them as videos or still images to the warfighter's helmet-mounted display via a wireless or wired connection.  PIXNET capability could be further exploited to enable a fully networked system, such as the Nett Warrior integrated multiple soldier systems capability, with multi-spectral still image and video sharing."

The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays.  The hand designed, static analog beamformers will be replaced with cost effective digital array systems capable of a yearly technology refresh.  By doing so, phased arrays will become ubiquitous throughout the DoD, moving onto many platforms for which phased arrays had been previously prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain.

                                                                                    "val": "The Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA) program will develop low Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) cryogenic coolers for application in high performance IR cameras.  The sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the-art Stirling cryo-coolers used for high performance IR FPAs are large size, high power and high cost.  On the other hand, thermoelectric (TE) coolers used in low performance IR cameras are relatively small, high power, and it is difficult to achieve temperatures below 200 Kelvin (K).\n\nTo reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thomson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based MEMS technology, for making IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C. MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.  Since a J-T cooler works by cooling from gas expansion, the coefficient of performance is expected to be much higher than state-of-the-art TE coolers, while being significantly smaller than Stirling coolers.  The chip-scale J-T cooler will be designed for pressure ratios of 4 or 5 to 1 with high compressor frequency in a small volume.  The goal of the MC-FPA program will be to demonstrate cooling down to 150 K.  The chip-scale micro-coolers will cost less and will be significantly smaller than current Stirling coolers.  Once the proof-of-principle is demonstrated, the subsequent program effort will focus on transitioning to chip-scale manufacture on 8-12 inch wafers, resulting in cooler costs decreasing to as low as $50.  An extended wavelength-range short-wave IR detector will be integrated with a micro-cooler for demonstration of the MC-FPA.  The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01."

The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and\/or sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor\/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field.  VAPR will build out an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient beacon.  Basic research for the VAPR program is being performed in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01.\n\nTo manufacture transient systems at scale will require significant research and development into: higher levels of circuit integration and complexity to realize advanced circuit functionalities; integrated system designs to achieve required function (in modes that offer programmed or triggered transience); integration of novel materials into circuit fabrication processes; and development of new packaging strategies.  The efficacy of the technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient sensor system.  The goal is to develop a suite of design principles, develop strategies and pathways, process flows, tools and basic components that are readily generalizable and can be leveraged towards the development of many other transient electronics devices."

The result is missed warnings and delayed reaction.  Digital electronics, while indispensable, cannot scale with the unprecedented demand for high-throughput processing.  For example, aggregate communications through optical fibers are currently >100 Terabit\/sec (Tbps) worldwide and are expected to exceed 1 Petabit\/sec by 2020.  In these high-rate optical links, signatures of malware propagation or denial of service attacks become small needles in a very large haystack.  Conventional digital processing attempts to extract relevant information, but it is not nearly fast enough to keep up, and falls far short of 100% aperture capture.\n\nGargoyle will develop photonic correlators for critical data processing tasks to provide near-zero latency, high-throughput processing of both digital and analog data.  Advanced optical correlator technology has the potential to scale up with ever-increasing bit rates.  Applications for this technology include direct sequence spread spectrum bandwidths exceeding 10 Gigahertz (GHz), and cyber defense in fiber-optic networks with scalability to future transmission rates exceeding 10 Tbps."

The field of atomic physics was revolutionized in the 1980's with the development of the technique of laser cooling of atoms.  Utilizing precisely tuned lasers with high spectral purity (narrow linewidth), atoms may be cooled down to nearly absolute zero temperature. So-called  cold atoms  are of great practical value to DoD position, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, for two reasons.  First, because the atoms are nearly unmoving, it is possible to make relatively long-duration measurements of their internal state, with minimal collisions between atoms or between atoms and the walls of the containing vessel.  This has led to the development of high-performance laboratory-based cold-atom fountain clocks, such as the U.S. national time standard, NIST-F1, and the rubidium fountains that underpin the U. S. Naval Observatory master clock.  Secondly, taking advantage of the relatively slow velocities of cold atoms, atomic interferometers have been demonstrated, which provide the highest precision measurements of rotation and acceleration.  Under the DARPA micro-PNT program, miniature high-performance cold atom-based atomic clocks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are being developed and have demonstrated superior performance in relatively low size, weight, and power (SWaP).\n\nThe Cold-Atom Microsystems (CAMS) program will develop enabling component technologies to support the practical deployment of cold-atom based microsystems, including low-SWaP atomic clocks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.  Technologies under investigation include high-efficiency narrow-linewidth laser sources, high-efficiency optical modulators, miniature high-isolation optical switches, compact low-loss optical isolators, miniature systems for laser frequency locking and agile frequency control, miniature ultra-high vacuum chambers and vacuum pumps, and techniques for controlling the vapor pressure of alkali metal atomic species over the DoD operating temperature range."

By employing an ultra-stable optical clock, the DISARMER program will allow for mixer-less digitization and thereby improve the dynamic range 100x over the state of the art. Such a wide bandwidth, high fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems while dramatically reducing the cost, size and weight of these systems.\n\nThe DISARMER program will develop a low jitter mode-locked laser to be used as the sampling source.  The program will also develop  a novel photonic processor chip on a silicon platform capable of hybrid electronic-photonic track-and-hold functionality and coherent photo-detection.  These silicon photonic integrated circuits will be integrated with CMOS driver circuits and packaged for integration in the full DISARMER system.

Specifically, silicon-germanium (SiGe) processes allow complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) logic to be integrated with RF heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), which enables mixed-signal circuits having RF analog capabilities tightly coupled to digital processing.  The Fast and Big Mixed-Signal Designs (FAB) program proposes to engage with a semiconductor fabrication partner to develop a SiGe fabrication process integrating 14nm CMOS.  The SiGe technology will enable the development of faster, more precise RF and signal acquisition components, while the 14nm CMOS process will enable low-power digital circuitry that can provide the large throughput required for data from the analog components.  The ability to mix massive digital computation at lower power with the fast sampling enabled by Silicone Germanium (SiGe) HBTs gives a powerful platform for future generations of Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.  This program will seek to overcome the tradeoffs in providing the highest performance analog performance versus the densest and lowest power digital processes.  Success will enable higher performance, lower cost, and more rapid insertion of advanced process technology into military electronics."

The Microscale Power Conversion (MPC) program is developing X-band RF transmitters as system-in-package modules, in which integrated circuit power amplifiers are integrated with dynamic, variable voltage power supplies using high-speed power switches.  Such an integrated microsystem will support military applications requiring several hundred Megahertz (MHz) of RF envelope bandwidth at large peak-to-average power ratios.  This integration approach will realize RF systems with significantly higher overall power efficiency and waveform diversity by changing from a fixed power supply architecture to a dynamic power supply architecture.  The program is structured in two technical tracks.  The first track is developing high-speed power switch technology to be used in the design of dynamic power supply and modulator circuits.  The second track is developing the simultaneous co-design and integration of the RF power amplifier and dynamic power supply circuits to achieve maximum overall power efficiency for the desired waveforms of interest.  The impact of this program will be the increased deployment of MPC RF transmitter systems on DoD platforms due to their more compact size, high efficiency, lower lifecycle cost and enhanced RF performance enabling, for example, significantly communications rates."

The high levels of integration possible in silicon technologies enable on-chip linearization, complex waveform synthesis, and digital calibration and correction.  Military applications include ultra-miniaturized transceivers for satellite communications-on-the-move, collision avoidance radars for micro-\/nano-air vehicles, and ultra-miniature seekers for small munitions.  The technology developed under this program was leveraged to improve the performance of high-power amplifiers based on other non-silicon technologies, through heterogeneous integration strategies.  Significant technical obstacles were overcome including the development of highly efficient circuits for increasing achievable output power of silicon devices (e.g., device stacking, power combining) at mm-waves; scaling high-efficiency amplifier classes to the mm-wave regime; integrated linearization architectures for complex modulated waveforms; and robust RF\/mixed-signal isolation strategies."

The A-to-I Look-Through program developed ultra-wideband digital radio frequency (RF) receivers based on Analog-to-Information Converter (AIC) technology.  Compared to conventional RF receivers, AIC-based designs increased receiver dynamic range and frequency band of regard while reducing data glut, power consumption and size.  Likewise, limitations of current-art power amplifier technology in simultaneously achieving high operational bandwidth, linearity, efficiency and power has resulted in well documented instances of electronic fratricide.  This program overcomes these limitations by converting digital signals directly to high power RF analog signals, thus eliminating the traditional high power amplifiers that are limited by the above-mentioned tradeoffs.  Transition is anticipated into airborne SIGINT and electronic warfare systems, as well as ground-based special operations forces systems."

PCAS will demonstrate the ability to digitally task a CAS platform from the ground to attack multiple\/simultaneous targets.  PCAS will allow the Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) the ability to rapidly engage multiple moving targets simultaneously within the area of operation.  PCAS's ability to digitally task a CAS platform to attack multiple\/simultaneous targets would improve U.S. ground forces operations and speed of attack.  The system will be designed to reduce collateral damage and potential fratricide to friendly forces.

The program will demonstrate the technology for launch and recovery of large unmanned aircraft capable of providing persistent 24\/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  By extending the ISR\/strike radius and simultaneously increasing time on station beyond current capabilities from smaller ships, TERN will enable novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  To achieve these goals, the program will create new concepts for aircraft launch and recovery, aircraft logistics and maintenance, and aircraft flight in regimes associated with maritime operating conditions.  The program will culminate in a launch and recovery demonstration.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts will enable a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  The anticipated transition partner is the Navy."

The Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES) program will develop a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), modular unmanned air vehicle that can carry a 3,000 lb useful load at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  ARES will enable distributed operations and access to compact, high altitude landing zones to reduce warfighter exposure to hostile threats and bypass ground obstructions.  ARES modular capability allows for different mission modules to be quickly deployed at the company level.  This enables the flexible employment of the following capabilities: cargo resupply, casualty evacuation, reconnaissance, weapons platforms, and other types of operations.  The enabling technologies of interest include adaptive wing structures, ducted fan propulsion system, lightweight materials, and advanced flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  Additionally, the program will explore new adaptable landing gear concepts to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch\/recovery platforms.  ARES vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery, for evacuating injured personnel from difficult-to-access locations, or to resupply isolated small units.  ARES is well suited for enhanced company operations concepts which would provide the warfighter\/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.  In FY13, this program was funded from PE 0602702E, Project TT-07.  The anticipated transition partners for this effort are the Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Forces."

HAWC will pursue flight demonstration of the critical technologies for an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile.  These technologies include advanced air vehicle configurations capable of efficient hypersonic flight, hydrocarbon scramjet-powered propulsion to enable sustained hypersonic cruise, thermal management approaches designed for high-temperature cruise, and affordable system designs and manufacturing approaches.  HAWC technologies also extend to reusable hypersonic air platforms for applications such as global presence and space lift.  The HAWC program will leverage advances made by the previously funded Falcon, X-51, and HyFly programs.  This is a joint program with the Air Force, and HAWC technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force after flight testing is complete."

The program will also consider traceability to, and ideally compatibility, with the Navy Vertical Launch System (VLS).  The metrics associated with this objective include total range, time of flight, payload, accuracy, and impact velocity.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a hypersonic boost glide system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aero-thermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelope, (2) the system attributes and subsystems required to be both survivable and lethal in relevant operational environments, and (3) approaches to reducing cost and improving affordability for both the demonstration system and future operational systems.

Collaboration of multiple assets offers new possibilities to conduct military missions using smaller air platforms to enhance survivability, reduce overall acquisition cost, create new effects, increase communications range and robustness in denied environments, increase search area, increase areas held at risk, reduce target prosecution reaction time, and provide multi-mission capabilities by combinations of assets.  This program is an outgrowth of the Manned-Unmanned Collaborative Autonomy program budgeted in PE 0602702E, TT-13.  This 6.3 effort will specifically focus on developing and demonstrating approaches that will expand the mission capabilities of legacy air assets though autonomy and collaborative behaviors."

DARPA will conduct a study of current air dominance efforts in coordination with the United States Air Force and Navy and explore potential technology developmental areas to ensure the air superiority of the United States in the future.  The study will consider roles of manned and unmanned platforms; the relative performance of alternative integrated systems concepts that combine various mixes of capabilities networked together; and the cost effectiveness of alternative balances of platforms and systems that provide surveillance, command and control, electronic warfare, and weapons functions.  Innovative concepts for platform, propulsion, sensors, weapons integration, avionics, and active and passive survivability features will be explored as part of the concept definition effort.  This effort will also explore the expanded development and use of automated and advanced aerospace engineering design tools, modeling, and simulation in areas that can increase the likelihood of producing more capable products with improved efficiency.  Following the initial multi-agency study, DARPA will present technical challenges to industry to allow them to explore and present potential solutions as part of the technical feasibility and system integration studies.  Enabling technologies are advanced networking capabilities, reliable navigation, passive and active defense, electronic attack, area denial, advanced sensors, and cyber technologies.  After the study, it is envisioned that high potential prototype programs will emerge to develop technologies for future air dominance.  Early planning for future technologies will also help to define the funding baselines for DoD research and development and acquisition programs."

The ISIS risk-reduction effort melded next-generation technologies for lightweight antenna apertures and components and lightweight multi-purpose structures.  The ISIS technology concept goal was to provide greater than ninety percent on-station 24\/7\/365 availability for simultaneous Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) (600 kilometers) and Ground-Based Moving Target Indicator (GMTI); greater than five years of autonomous, unmanned flight; in-theater communications links; and CONUS-based sensor analysis and operation.  The current technology risk-reduction efforts were focused on demonstrating the key technologies that would enable these capabilities."

The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of defensive systems, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion\/propellants, unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems."

The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of defensive systems, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion\/propellants, unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems."

ALASA seeks improvements in cost, responsiveness, flexibility, and resilience with a single approach.  ALASA will enable small satellites to be deployed to orbit from an airborne platform, allowing performance improvement, reducing range costs, and flying more frequently, which drives cost per event down.  The ability to relocate and launch from virtually any major runway around the globe reduces the time needed to deploy a satellite system.  Launch point offset permits essentially any possible orbit direction to be achieved without concerns for launch direction imposed by geography.  Finally, launch point offset allows the entire operation to be moved should a particular fixed airfield become unavailable due to natural phenomena or other issues.  Challenges include, but are not limited to: in-air separation of aircraft and orbit-insertion launch stages, development of alternatives to current range processes, control of weight and margin under a hard gross weight limit, and achieving a cost per flight of $1 million, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of 100 lb.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and Army."

Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located.  Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra-high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning.  The SDA program will develop a space management system that allows cognitive reasoning and decision support to execute space operations with current and proposed assets within real and synthetic environments.\n\nSDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data collection and data processing\/ fusion to provide automated data synergy.  The resulting increase in space domain awareness will enhance overall space safety of flight, and allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions.  The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in non-traditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain.  SDA will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses.  Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data, model-based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of system integrity.  SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from non-traditional sources, such as amateur astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques.\n\nAlso funded within this program is the Galileo effort which, will develop technology to image a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite from the ground.  Galileo will utilize fixed mobile telescopes, each with adaptive optics and a guide star, to create multiple baselines that can be used to reconstruct the image through an inverse Fourier transform.

A major goal of the SST program, to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance has been achieved.  This capability enables ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The initial program is transitioning to Air Force Space Command.\n\nIn addition, the program is investigating data fusion and advanced algorithms for correlation of unknown objects.  SST is expected to generate a large number of uncorrelated targets (UCTs), and new methods will need to be employed to rapidly characterize and attribute the new objects.  Furthermore, the data fusion effort is investigating methods which combine observations from disparate sensors (such as optical and radar installations) to more rapidly, accurately, and completely provide positive identification of orbital objects, rapidly characterize them, and maintain a catalog of determined characteristics.\n\nThe SST Australia effort will provide a further operational demonstration of the SST at the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, Western Australia.  Such a location presents a more operationally relevant demonstration, with a richer and more interesting population of SSA targets in geosynchronous orbit.  A demonstration in Australia will investigate telescope performance and observe objects and orbits not visible from the current site in New Mexico.  In addition, the demonstration will generate data for analysis and fusion efforts, which will be used to further refine and evaluate data processing techniques, such as those developed under the data fusion effort.  This program will address technical challenges which may arise from an Australian site, including adaptations to a different telescope environment, and the logistical and communications challenges presented by a site significantly more remote than the current SST location."

A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) altitudes, furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation that such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) teleoperated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix servicing program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and expanding beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program seeks to validate robotics operations in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks with a Servicer\/Tender, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners.  The program will examine utilization of ride-along capability to GEO supporting upgrading, repairing, assembling, and reconfiguring satellites.  The program will include an early LEO flight experiment focused on satlets, as a path of risk reduction for modular assembly on orbit.  Key challenges include robotic tool\/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, and integration and efficient and low cost transportation of robotic tools.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and commercial spacecraft servicing providers."

The program will demonstrate the technologies needed to assemble a large (>5m) and near-diffraction limited optical aperture from modular components that are launched as separate payloads.  The program will include a scalable zero-g demonstration of a functional optical system that maintains the precision and large-scale physical stability required, and utilizes at least one segmented optical surface.  This program will address technical challenges of precision mechanical assembly from modular components, multiple object rendezvous and coupling in space, and active surface measurement, compensation and control.  Modular construction in space is intrinsically more challenging than ground-based assembly in that there is not necessarily any measurement and support infrastructure and equipment available, such as interferometer test towers.  Therefore, the modular pieces and system design must include self-contained measurement and alignment capabilities to be employed after or during assembly.  The OASIS program will demonstrate the feasibility of assembling complex and highly precise structures in space which, in assembled form, are larger than the capacity of any existing or planned space launch vehicle.  This capability could enable a number of surveillance and communications instruments in orbit that are not possible today or in the near future under the current paradigm.

Each such \"fractionated\" module could contribute a unique capability, for example, computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, or it can replicate the capability of another module; the cluster would deliver a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft.  The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit capable of semi-autonomous reconfiguration or a rapid defensive scatter\/re-gather maneuver.  The System F6 program will develop key technologies to facilitate fractionated and disaggregated architectures.  The F6 Technology Package (F6TP), a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms that enables semi-autonomous multi-body cluster flight and secure, distributed, real-time sharing of various spacecraft resources at the cluster level will also be developed.  Multiple versions of the F6 Technology Package will be developed on the basis of open-source interface standards, software, and reference designs termed the F6 Developer's Kit (FDK).  The utility of the architecture in low earth orbit (LEO) is significantly enabled by persistent broadband connectivity to the ground which allows resource sharing between space-based modules and terrestrial network nodes.  A solution to enable high-availability, low-latency, persistent, high-bandwidth communication with LEO spacecraft will be developed in the course of the F6 program."

The goal of the SeeMe program is to demonstrate the ability to get near-real-time, i.e., no older than ~90 minutes, images directly to individual users' handheld devices from space.  This will be accomplished via a very low cost constellation of inexpensive, disposable small satellites routinely and inexpensively put in orbit through low cost horizontal (aircraft-released) launches.  The current methodology for satisfying imagery needs from space is to build multipurpose systems with very high reliability and long life, at very high costs, and launch them on expensive vertical launch boosters.  In most cases, commercial or military, the time to deliver an already built space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system suitable to meet tactically desired ground sample distance is on the order of 20+ months, and the data delivery mechanism is typically more than several days (and up to weeks) to the end user.  SeeMe intends to radically shorten the entire cycle: ground development time, launch cadence, and on-orbit request-to-image-delivery time through new satellite manufacturing techniques, advanced low-cost aperture technologies, leveraging alternative launch concepts, and a novel direct-to-user command and data exfiltration architecture.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and the Army."

Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.\n\nThe goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost."

Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems.  The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments.  Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices.  The current focus in micro technologies is to improve navigation, position and timing capabilities for uncompromised navigation and positioning in today's dynamic military field of operations."

This suite of sensors, when integrated into an inertial measurement unit (IMU), will enable self-contained navigation and timing in the absence of signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS), due to environmental interference or adversary action such as GPS jamming.  The Micro-PNT program is developing miniature high performance gyroscopes, accelerometers, and clocks, based on both solid state and atomic technologies.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques under development will enable the fabrication of a single package containing all the necessary devices in a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small SWaP+C of these technologies will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and individual soldiers.\n\nThe successful realization of Micro-PN&T requires the development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of the error sources at the micro-scale, and development of micro-scale systems for sensors based on atomic physics techniques.  Innovative 3-D microfabrication techniques under development will allow co-fabrication of dissimilar devices on a single chip, such that clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and calibration stages can be integrated into a small, low power architecture. The program is developing miniature atomic clocks, based on laser-cooled neutral atoms and trapped ions as well as inertial sensors based on atomic interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance.

Blast-related injuries have emerged as the signature wounds of recent conflicts.  To better understand the level of blast exposure received by warfighters, which is critical for developing and providing better treatment, low-cost personal sensors to record such critical signatures as blast overpressure had to be developed.  DARPA rapidly developed and fielded the Blast Gauge to better understand the combat exposures responsible for these injuries by properly capturing relevant data at the time of injury.  The gauges have been effective at capturing such events during operations in Afghanistan, achieving a number of milestones from the first recording during an IED attack to the first use of sensor data in medical evaluation of a service member with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  Unexpectedly, gauge recordings have shown that potentially hazardous exposures may also occur in noncombat situations.  Typically these happen during training using weapon systems.  As the Blast Gauge is being deployed, military services require additional tools to begin properly using the device.  The Blast Exposure Accelerated Sensor Transfer (BEAST) program is a 1-year effort to provide additional tools for users and complete transition to military service sustainment."

These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave\/microwave.  Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module.  The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.\n\nThe field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer\/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date.  Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication.  This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies.  This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures.  Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).\n\nThe program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon.  The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer\/nanometer scale.  The program includes the development of micrometer\/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf\/mmwave\/microwave technologies.  For example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability."

This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoC) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.   \n\nThis program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E , Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01  The Advanced Technology Development part of this program will leverage these complementary efforts  to focus on the establishment of an accessible, manufacturable technology for device-level heterogeneous integration of a wide array of materials and devices (including, for example, multiple electronics and MEMS technologies) with complex silicon-enabled (e.g. CMOS) architectures on a common silicon substrate platform.  This part of the program is expected to culminate in accessible foundry processes of DAHI technology and demonstrations of advanced microsystems with innovative architectures and designs that leverage heterogeneous integration.  By the end of the program, this effort seeks to establish a technologically mature, sustainable DAHI foundry service to be made available (with appropriate computer-aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers."

Frequency control is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, and position-sensing and navigation technology, among many other core DoD capabilities.  To date, however, optical frequency synthesis has been limited to laboratory environments due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of optical comb-based synthesizers.  Recent developments on the DARPA Quantum Assisted Sensing and Readout (QuASAR) and in Ultrafast Laser Science and Engineering (PULSE) programs have demonstrated the possibility of generating self-referenced combs in microscale resonators.  Combined with technology and fabrication techniques developed in the Photonically Optimized Embedded Microprocessor (POEM) and Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) programs, it is now possible to develop a chip-scale integrated optical frequency synthesizer.  Ubiquitous low-cost robust optical frequency synthesis is expected to create a similar disruptive capability in optical technology as microwave frequency synthesis did in the 1940s, enabling high-bandwidth coherent optical communications, coherent synthesized-aperture LiDAR, portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, high-resolution standoff gas\/toxin detection, and intrusion detection, among other applications.\n\nThe Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will create a microscale, high-accuracy optical frequency synthesizer, in a compact, robust package, suitable for deployment in a wide variety of mission-critical DoD applications."

Availability of very low cost and small form-factor infrared (IR) cameras will facilitate new techniques and applications that could provide the decisive edge needed in modern battlefields.  These cameras will allow a soldier to have practical thermal imaging capability for locating warm objects (e.g., enemy combatants) in darkness.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) thermal camera will be integrated with a handheld device such as a cell phone with network capability for tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  In order to achieve this goal, breakthroughs will be required in low-cost thermal imagers manufactured using wafer- scale integration, vacuum packaging, low-cost optics and low-power signal processing.  By the end of the program, the imager chips will be fully integrated with a low-cost processor and optics.  The camera will have wireless connectivity to integrate video display with cell phones or PDAs.  U.S. Army PEO Soldier Sensors and Lasers (SSL), PM Optics USMC, USSOCOM and industry will be the transition partners."

These fiber-laser arrays are sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact on the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element possesses an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements have been enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program developed kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which provided an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they tested the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays are conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding additional elements to the array.  Excalibur provided the technology foundation for defense of next generation airborne platforms, including all aircraft flying at altitudes below 50,000 ft, against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and more capable air-to-air missiles converted for use as ground-to-air missiles.  Excalibur technology will enable these platforms to fly at lower altitude and conduct truly persistent, all-weather ground missions, such as reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Further capabilities may include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.\n\nThe Excalibur program also developed efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam-combining.  The potential of these arrays to scale to tactical power levels (100 kilowatt class) was also investigated.  These laser amplifier arrays were designed to work in tandem with the core laser components developed under the Excalibur program in PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  In addition a conceptual design and CONOPS development for a High Energy Laser Counter Measure (HELCM) system were developed to enable a near-term capability for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  This technology will transition via industry, and will be incorporated into the Endurance program discussed earlier in this project (MT-15)."

AWARE aggregated the following programs: Lambda Scale, Broadband, Multi-Band and Wide Field of View.

This will give the commander insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making and execution support capability and provide secure multimedia information interfaces and assured software to \"on the move\" users.  Integration of collection management, planning and battlefield awareness programs is an essential element for achieving battlefield dominance through assured information systems.\n\nThe goals of the Information Integration Systems project are to take diverse data inputs from a variety of sources, efficiently disseminate the information, and perform distributed and dynamic all-source correlation and fusion to produce an integrated, geo-spatially referenced, battlefield database and knowledge-base.  The principal element of this project is assured communications using standard and non-traditional means, on and off the battlefield.\n\nThe goals of the Secure Information and Network Systems project are to develop and test emerging computer and network systems where the impact of the systems and the vulnerabilities of the systems are not kinetically based.  Computer and network security technologies arising from other projects will be further identified, developed, integrated, and tested."

The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:\n-  High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability\n-  Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, and scalability\n-  Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD\/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in a very high-threat environments\n-  Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF\/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats"

Rather, such communication must rely on approaches such as balloons and temporary communication towers that have a high logistical burden and are extremely vulnerable.  Building upon technologies investigated under other High-Capacity Links technologies programs within this project, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will overcome these limitations by developing a re-locatable, long-range (10-100s of km) communication infrastructure that provides high-capacity (10s of megabits per second) data links from within a protected space.  The key innovation in this program is the use of a large number of rapidly deployable, distributed, ground-based antenna arrays that can form a coherent aperture for directional transmission and reception of information to\/from tactical wireless networks.  Program challenges include the fundamental limits (power and extent) of transmitter gain as well as the rapid and practical deployment of the ground-based arrays.  When completed, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will significantly extend the reach of tactical communication systems without the need for vulnerable and costly infrastructure. Technologies developed in this program will transition to the Navy and Air Force."

The technology development culminated in the demonstration of a large-sized coherent, active electronically-steerable array (AESA) with an output power density of 5W per square cm and a total layer thickness of less than 1cm.  As part of the High-Capacity Links efforts in this Project, the SMART technology approach resulted in a breakthrough in performance over conventional millimeter-wave approaches.  The 3-D multi-layer assemblies developed will greatly reduce AESA packaging complexity and enable very compact, low-cost, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency circuit \"building blocks\" to combine to form arbitrarily large arrays.  New capabilities, such as the ability to construct reconfigurable and\/or multi-band AESAs and other MMW circuits, will be enabled by this architectural approach.  The SMART program is transitioning through industrial producers of MMW radar and communication system components for DoD applications."

The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb\/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking requirements of deployed military forces.  DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system has broken the 10 Gb\/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb\/s capacity.  Furthermore, the hybrid optical\/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms.  Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency, but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gbps backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current ORCA system.  The 100 Gbps RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services."

Mobile Hotspots will exploit advances in millimeter-wave technology and airborne networking to develop a self-organizing, 1 Gbps mobility tactical airborne network formed from highly-directional communications links to interconnect mounted and dismounted warfighters, dispersed tactical operations centers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.  Low size, weight, and power (SWaP) designs will be integrated with commercial and military communications equipment and mounted on tactical UAVs and ground vehicles to provide network access to mobile users via infrastructureless hotspots that are compatible with existing radios.

This content can include images, video, maps, situational awareness, and command and control information.  Advances in communications technologies are enabling high-capacity communications in remote environments.  However, the current centralized or regional storage and dissemination of information presents reliability and capacity challenges with distributing relevant information to users at the edge.  Commercial industry has developed approaches to the autonomous dissemination of high demand information by using distributed servers and advanced networking and information database technologies, combined with highly-reliable fixed networking infrastructure that have embedded complex information exploitation tools.  The commercial system is enabled by infrastructure that is not available to the warfighter.  This Advanced Networks technologies program will leverage commercial technologies to develop, prototype, and demonstrate the networking technologies and information dissemination techniques needed to enable efficient and robust content distribution using dynamic, mobile, and ad hoc military networks.  CBMEN will be installed and demonstrated on existing radios.  Capabilities from this effort will transition to the DoD."

In addition, this effort investigated Wireless Distributive Computing (WDC), Content Based Access (CBA), and smart antenna technologies to enhance the network and node ability to understand the operating environment, mission concept of operations, and node responsibilities to assist in data processing, information dissemination, and accomplishment of military mission objectives.  Further, this program will develop a low-cost handheld\/body wearable wireless node that can be used to form high-density ad hoc networks and gateways to the Global Information Grid.  This program will also develop robust networking architecture(s) and network technologies\/processes that will exploit high-density node configurations.

Accomplishing this depends on providing reliable wireless communications to all U.S. forces, platforms, and devices in all phases of conflict.  Based on initial work under this effort, the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program in this PE\/Project was created to enable reliable operation of military and commercial communications and radar systems when occupying the same spectrum bands.  As part of the Advanced Networks technologies effort, the Wireless Network Defense program increases wireless network capacity and reliability for tactical users, with the ultimate vision of making high quality data services pervasive throughout the DoD.  The primary focus is mitigation of advanced threats particular to the security of wireless networks.  The program intends to leverage the capabilities of the dynamic network to identify sources of misinformation, whether malicious or due to poor configuration, across the functional components of the complex system, and mitigate the corresponding effects.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services."

The DoD will need more highly-integrated and networked data\/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor\/radar bands.  The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will be made available to the DoD."

Current approaches are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time-based processing for each emitter.  As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF\/SS) challenges, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection.  This approach will take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the battlefield.  To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices.  It will also develop approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  Building upon technologies investigated within other programs within this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services."

The Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program, working to expand Low Probability of Detection\/Anti-Jam (LPD)\/(AJ) technologies, seeks new ways to protect our signals from exploitation by increasingly sophisticated adversaries, in ways that can be maintained as commercial technology advances.  Three different techniques are in development: 1) Waveform Complexity uses advanced communications waveforms that are difficult to recover without knowledge and understanding of the signals itself; 2) Spatial Diversity uses distributed communications devices and the communication environment to disguise and dynamically vary the apparent location of the signal; and 3) Interference Exploitation makes use of the clutter in the signal environment to make it difficult for an adversary to isolate a particular signal.  The program's objective is to make modular communications technology that is inexpensive to incorporate in existing and emerging radio systems (<$100 incremental cost) but pushes adversaries to need more than 1,000x our processing power - supercomputer-level processing power.  Another track of the program will extend the CLASS technology to provide LPD communications.  These techniques will drastically reduce the detectability of communications signals beyond current capabilities.  Scalable performance will allow LPD techniques to better trade information rate for communications capacity.  Technologies from this program are planned to transition to the Services."

As adversary capabilities advance, the DoD will need new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability. As part of Advanced Networks technologies efforts, the Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) program addresses these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, to develop heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems. Anti-jam, Low Probability of Detection (LPD), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols will be developed. Second, to create a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that draws from commercial communication architectures. The defense contractor community can build specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture. Finally, to create a government controlled development environment to allow rapid refresh of communications technology and allow third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies."

In addition, sufficient capacity to enable command and control of advanced weapons systems and communication of advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) artifacts are necessary.

As part of Low Probability of Detection\/Anti-Jam (LPD\/AJ) technologies efforts in the Project, the program will develop models of adversary, commercial, and friendly cognitive radios and implement those models to assess, in real time, the current and future dynamics of the communications network.  Core technologies for operation in highly dynamic and\/or high jamming to signal environments will be developed to include: automated jamming waveform forensics; local environment assessment (time, space, frequency, polarization); technologies for addressing known attack strategies and interference properties; and antenna, signal processing, modulation, and network optimization technologies.  Based on predictions of the level of communication success compared to mission communication requirements, the cognitive radio will choose waveform selections\/configurations that best achieve mission objectives.  The cognitive radio will include the capability to analyze and select optimum frequency, waveform, and network configurations during all aspects of a mission.  The design effort will lead to new radio communication architectures, more robust radio communication networking, and better understanding of selection amongst interference avoidance and interference suppression strategies.  This program also seeks to enable communication between dispersed and distributed emitters and receivers to provide a multiplier in capacity for both locating emitters and assessing effectiveness of an electronic attack.  Technologies developed in this program will transition to the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines."

Current cyber defenses are primarily based on network and host intrusion detection and look for break-ins and abnormal behavior without context.  The CINDER program built tools and techniques that applied mission templates of advanced cyber espionage onto seemingly normal internal system and network activity.  The program focused on identifying ongoing adversary missions rather than a person, program, or particular piece of malware.  Through this CINDER uncovered ongoing advanced persistent cyber threats and espionage within our cyber environments.  Capabilities from this program transitioned to DoD and the defense industrial base."

It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.\n\nThe objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  \n\nThe Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic\/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical\/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations."

The goal of the HELLADS program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system that will provide an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.  HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, in addition to enabling high precision\/low collateral damage and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  Advancements in beam control and other subsystems that are required for the practical integration of a laser weapon into existing tactical platforms will be explored.  With the assistance of the Services, the HELLADS program will pursue the necessary analysis, coordination, and design activity for a prototype laser weapon system incorporating the HELLADS laser system and the ABC turret into air-, ground-, or sea-based tactical vehicles.  While the prototype laser weapon system module is in design and development, the HELLADS 150 kilowatt (kW) laser will be made available for demonstration opportunities and transition to the Army, Navy, or Air Force."

In current operations, soldiers carry upwards of 50lbs of equipment, in some cases over 100lbs, over long distances in terrain not always accessible by wheeled platforms that support infantry.  As a result, the soldier's combat effectiveness can be compromised.  The LS3 program will design and develop prototypes capable of carrying 400lbs of payload for 20 miles in 24 hours, negotiating terrain at endurance levels expected of typical squad maneuvers.  LS3 will leverage technical breakthroughs of prior biologically inspired legged platform development efforts.  It will develop system designs to the scale and performance adequate for infantry squad mission applications, focusing on platform, control, and human-machine interaction capabilities, as well as secondary design considerations, such as acoustic signature.

These are critical enablers for performing mission-relevant tasks in austere and remote regions, partially-destroyed roads, high-threat anti-access\/area denied environments, rubble-filled areas, and providing greater range\/endurance for soldiers, platforms, and personnel.\n\nThe Robotics Challenge program will boost innovation in autonomous systems and expand platform utility through enhanced actuation, energy density, perception, locomotion, agile reconfiguration, and design efficiency.  Program thrusts are centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build \"machine trust\", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments.  The Robotics Challenge program consists of a series of obstacle course style challenge events that will focus on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot capabilities for disaster response.  Robotics Challenge events will drive advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power.  Program objectives focus on technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective design, validation, and construction of autonomous technology, and human-robot interaction.

Traditionally, Command and Control (C2) systems and planning have operated independently across domains and are optimized for a permissive environment where communications are assured.  However, to address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Integrated Planning for Strike, ISR, and Spectrum Planning (IPSIS)  program will develop tools to tightly synchronize strike, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and communications spectrum management planning and maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization, exploiting synergies, and defending against network disruption. The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  The tools will provide a decomposition of the commander's intent into targeting and information needs, and develop plans to satisfy the identified synchronization needs across multiple domains.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and sophisticated plans, and real-time execution visualization capabilities.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  The IPSIS tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy."

The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services."

Commercial computing services are enabled by massive data centers and high-capacity terrestrial networks, but this level of infrastructure is not available to forward-deployed military forces that operate in mobile, disrupted\/disadvantaged, intermittent, high-latency environments.  SDDC will make the cyber environment as maneuverable as the troops it supports by creating computing architectures that combine aspects of multi-computing and cloud computing with dynamic monitoring and adaptation of distributed computing environments.  These maneuverable architectures will be cognizant of bandwidth-limited data links that operate in contested environments and lack quality-of-service guarantees.  An additional requirement arises from the need to ensure access to critical data even when requisite data services are temporarily down or when the data is stored in a format that is no longer supported.  An even more stressing case arises when the entire network goes down: restoring the network and reinitiating service to all users is an urgent requirement.  SDDC technologies will automatically and dynamically adjust policies and allocate bandwidth, computational resources, and cyber-defense assets to provide reliable, energy-aware, large-scale data processing to forward-deployed tactical users, without dependence upon external non-military resources."

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels, and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep ocean sonar nodes will operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  For the vast shallow continental shelf areas, the program similarly adopts distributed mobile sensors, but instead leverages insights in non-acoustic sensing from above.  The effort is highly focused on achieving new detection modalities with sufficient low power, weight, and size (SWaP), to enable UAV implementations.  Initial efforts will focus on identifying the best detection methods leveraged from state-of-the-art sensors and new physical and operational insights.  Provided compelling detection capability is achievable, prototype systems will evolve through at-sea testing and sensor integration.  The program seeks to achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  This program will transition to the Navy."

This program will demonstrate the utility of negative stiffness structural elements developed under the Multifunctional Materials and Structures program, budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, in the ridged support frames of real world DoD platforms.  As the demands on military platforms increase, so does the need for structures to mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments.  Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve either extreme stiffness or damping.  In military platforms, extremely stiff structures provide high strength, but readily transfer loads to passengers often resulting in serious injury.  Conversely, existing damping structures can reduce the load transferred to passengers, but only at the expense of structural strength and integrity.  By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program will enable the design of military platforms with the ability to continually adapt their properties to match the demands of a dynamic environment.  Technology from this program will transition to the Navy."

The U.S. Navy's ability to operate their submarine fleet with improved capability allows for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines could exploit expanded areas which were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including within missions of antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence.  The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class Submarine.  The Navy will evaluate this component in sea trials.  It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement Submarines, and back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class Submarines.

These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  Building upon challenges identified under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program within Project NET-02, the Undersea Architecture program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea energy and data transfers to manned and unmanned fixed and mobile undersea systems; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment and sustainment technologies.\n\nThe Undersea Architecture program will focus on orders of magnitude reductions in the cost and complexity of sustained undersea operations compared to conventional undersea systems, and will explore the trade-offs between manned, unmanned, and fixed infrastructure systems.  The program will emphasize at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Undersea Architecture technologies will transition to the Navy."

Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.\n\nThe Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution by leveraging the powering and performance results from the previously funded Super-Fast Submerged Transport program, PE 0602702E, Project TT-03, to develop and demonstrate an undersea vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: reliable undersea connectivity, autonomy, guidance, and navigation; obstacle avoidance; and propulsion and energy systems compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements.  The program will culminate in a series of at-sea demonstrations and will transition to the Navy."

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  Additionally, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.  \n\nThe Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission.  The project is primarily driven by four needs:  1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control, tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.\n\nThe Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis."

This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.

The ANS approach relies on three major technology innovations.  The first is development of a new type of inertial measurement unit (IMU) that requires fewer GPS position fixes. Using cold atom technology, this IMU exceeds the performance of strategic-grade IMUs, with comparable size, weight, and power (SWaP).  The second innovation uses Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground-, air-, and space-based sources, as well as natural SoOps to reduce dependency on GPS position fixes.  These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and will use specially tailored algorithms to determine position.  The third technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment.  This capability will enhance new advanced component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) emerging from other programs in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors.  Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures will build upon these capabilities by enabling \"plug-and-play\" integration of both existing and future navigation components and processing to allow real-time reconfiguration of navigation systems.  If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized.

Currently, military sensors are designed and developed with unique, mission-specific hardware and software capability requirements into a single, fully integrated device.  This approach significantly increases both the cost and difficulty of meeting continuously changing requirements and upgrades.  Commercial processes, such as those used in the smart phone industry, create reference designs for common system functions and features to accelerate system development time.  This makes change to requirements and completing upgrades far simpler.  Adopting these commercial processes enables a mission-independent, designed-to-cost \"commercial smart core\" that can be combined with an appliqu\u00e9 of mission-specific hardware to provide low cost, independently upgradable, and previously infeasible sensor system distribution capabilities.  The Smart Munitions effort plans to use ADAPT's sensing, processing, communications, and location capabilities to provide positive identification and man-in-the-loop control of distributed, unattended ground sensor systems.  It also seeks to develop a reference design to demonstrate capability and develop tactics for unattended sensors.  This program will transition to the Services."

The Multi-Function Optical Sensing (MOS) program will enable an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near\/mid\/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-function optical system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The Multi-Function Optical Sensor program seeks to advance the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Services."

Developing new modes for these systems is costly and time consuming, and porting modes among intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms is nearly impossible.  The Software-Defined ISR program seeks to improve the utility of existing and emerging sensor and EW systems by enabling rapid development and porting of modes among open-architecture systems and permitting users to efficiently deploy new capabilities to current radar, EW, and ESM systems via software upgrades.  This will allow the Services to leverage investments in mode development by re-using software across different platforms and when platforms are upgraded, while enhancing operational capability by allowing a system to be optimized to the mission.  This program will develop and demonstrate software tools to enable rapid development and porting of ISR modes on open-architecture hardware systems.  Radar, EW, and ESM modes will be developed and demonstrated to pave the way for future development of cognitive radar capabilities, and ported among Open Architecture (OA) compliant ISR systems to build and demonstrate a mode development environment (ModeLab). The key elements of the Software-Defined ISR program are as follows: to develop Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) tools to support rapid porting of modes onto open-architecture systems, including the Flexible Open-Architecture Middleware (FOAM) and the ModeLab for rapid mode development; to demonstrate the ability to rapidly develop and port new radar, EW, and ESM modes to open-architecture RF systems; to develop and demonstrate implementation of multiple modes spanning a range of performance and capabilities; and to perform data collections to support mode development.

The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments."

When an unknown or advanced RF threat appears, BLADE networked nodes will dynamically characterize the emitter, synthesize an effective countering technique, and evaluate jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat.  An optimization process will tailor real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources.  Thus BLADE will enable the rapid defeat of new RF threats and provide the warfighter with real-time feedback on jam effectiveness.  The program is planned for transition to the Services."

Several prototype optical surveillance and observation systems are being developed that: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and\/or collateral damage.  The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools.  Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight, and power (SWaP) of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and UAV platform integration.  MIST will also continue to integrate technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) and the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) efforts.  MIST will develop an optical rifle scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy at range while also enhancing the capability for close quarters combat.  The MIST program will transition the optical ISR technology to the Air Force and SOCOM."

The program goes beyond landing aids in DVE to address all elements of combat to include landing, takeoff, hover\/taxi, enroute, navigation, lethality, and survivability.  Building on previous RF sensors advancements, the program will seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently-developed situational and combat support systems to provide multifunction capability with flexibility of adding new mission functions.  This will reduce the overall size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of subsystems and protrusive exterior antennas on military aircraft, enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  The program approach includes; 1) Development of synthetic vision for pilots that fuses sensor data with high-resolution terrain databases, 2) Development of Advanced Rotary Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), utilizing silicon-based tile arrays, for agile electronically scanning technology at low SWAP-C, 3) Implementation of software development kit to re-define modes as required by mission or platform needs; ease of adding new modes via software without hardware modifications.  Transition is planned to the Services."

Under clear conditions, targets are easily-identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary\/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program seeks to develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is planned to transition to AFSOC."

As a corollary to time synchronization, this program will also enable GPS independent positioning to maintain precise time synchronization between collaborating mobile users.  Key attributes of this program are global availability; minimal and low cost infrastructure; anti-jamming capability; and performance equal to or better than GPS through recent advances in cold atom-based clocks and optical time transfer.  Other recent advances show that navigation systems using non-traditional sensors can be rapidly configured to provide accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities.  This program will build on these and other PNT technologies, and extend this level of performance to include the underwater environment in addition to surface, indoor, and airborne environments.  Demonstrations on relevant platforms in relevant environments will be used to validate the technology.  This program will transition to the Services, emphasizing platforms that operate in GPS-denied environments."

Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and static due to pre-programmed target lists and operating mode, limiting mission execution capabilities.  Extending ATR technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operation limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life cycle maintenance costs.  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, sparse representations, manifold learning, and embedded systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR.  Three core areas the program will focus on are: development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR; recognition technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software footprint of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services."

Significant challenges arose as the result of two warfighting trends.  First, the ever-changing mix of airborne platforms now includes a greater number of smaller UAVs.  Second, the target set is increasingly challenging and now includes vehicles and individual dismounts that operate under foliage and in urban canyons, using camouflage, obscurants, and other means of concealment.  In response to these challenges, the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program developed enhanced optical, electro-optical, photonic and other technologies for airborne optical sensing systems.  The remaining effort in this program, HALOE (High Altitude Lidar Operations Experiment), demonstrated, in an operational environment, the full capability of a 3-D imaging system.  HALOE successfully completed the CONUS flight testing phase and was deployed OCONUS for further testing and system checkout to address current and emerging needs of U.S. forces under the direction of commanders in theater during 2011.  The completed HALOE system transitioned to the U.S. Army."

Efforts will focus on difficult ISR environments, for example (a) urban environments with extensive building obscuration, large volumes of civilian traffic, and feature-rich terrain, (b) mountain environments with highly variable terrain elevation, complex local and regional threat networks, and predominantly dismounted adversaries, (c) jungle environments with targets under heavy canopy, animals, and other sources of clutter masking human activity, and (d) maritime and littoral environments where threats now include terrorists, pirates, smugglers, drug traffickers, and other non-traditional adversaries.  The resulting technology will enable operators to more effectively use ISR data in the execution of wide area search, border and road monitoring, high value target tracking, overwatch, and other missions."

Insight provides new exploitation capabilities through an integrated, standards-based system that is designed for mission flexibility and cross-theater applicability.  Insight will enable detection of threat networks through combination and analysis of information from imaging and non-imaging sensors and other sources.  The technical approach emphasizes model-based correlation, adversary behavior modeling, threat network analysis tools, resource management tools, a unified data management and processing environment, novel exploitation algorithms and analysis methodologies, and tools to integrate human and machine processing, including visualization, hypothesis manipulation, on-line learning, and distributed social intelligence.  Insight development activities leverage both virtual and physical test bed environments.  The virtual test bed enables evaluation of alternative sensor mixes and algorithms under extended operating conditions.  The physical test bed enables live testing under realistic operational conditions using current and next generation sensing and processing systems.  Insight technology development is being coordinated with the following potential transition sponsors: Army Program Executive Office-Intelligence, Electronic Warfare & Sensors, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) - Army, Army Intelligence and Security Command, Air Force - Distributed Common Ground Station, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  Insight provides a unified architecture for plug-and-play ISR with extensibility to all Services and Combatant Commands, initially CENTCOM, SOCOM, and PACOM."

The U.S. military has limited capability to obtain airborne ISR observations of many critical problem areas, and overhead observations are limited by sensor resolution, collection timeline, and platform geometry.  However, millions of videos posted worldwide reflect events and areas of interest for national security, and the number is rapidly increasing.  WISR will use ground-level video and still images to produce 3-D and 4-D reconstructions of events and use these reconstructions to code descriptions of dynamic content, rather than focusing on the identification and movement of individual objects and humans in the scene.  WISR constructs will be suitable for describing and differentiating patterns-of-life to reflect local and societal changes.  The program will use this data in support of three missions: intelligence preparation for expeditionary forces entering a new area of operation, reconstruction of significant events worldwide, and battle damage assessment.  These techniques will transition to operational commands and the intelligence community."

The range is designed to replicate complex, heterogeneous networks.  It has revolutionized cyber testing to enable efficient cyber experimentation and facilitate realistic testing of tools and techniques to enable high fidelity assessments of cyber tools and techniques and the rapid transition of research programs to operations.  This program is available for leverage or use by all Federal Government organizations.  The program has transitioned to the DoD's Test Resource Management Center (TRMC)."

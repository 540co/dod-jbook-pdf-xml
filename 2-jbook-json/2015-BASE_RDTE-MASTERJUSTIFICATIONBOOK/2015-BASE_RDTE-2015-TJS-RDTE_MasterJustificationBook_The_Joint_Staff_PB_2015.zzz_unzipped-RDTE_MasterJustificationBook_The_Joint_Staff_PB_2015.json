The JCD&E Community is comprised of the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, National Guard Bureau (NGB), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The Director for Joint Force Development (DJ-7) leads the joint force development efforts on behalf of the Chairman.  The J-7 staff coordinates all efforts with respect to the JCD&E Community.\n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&E initiatives originate from an annual call for nominations from CCMD's and Services, and from assessment of CCMDs identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA).  JCD&E project submissions undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Community to confirm suitability for experimentation and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  Preliminary analysis also confirms alignment to the Chairman\u2019s priorities for developing Joint Force 2020 and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) strategic priority areas.  The resulting annual list of project submissions includes concepts for development and experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution.  These efforts are prioritized and approved by the CCMDs and Service members of the Synchronization Board and forwarded to the Joint Capabilities Board (JCB)\/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) for approval.\n\nJCD&E activities examine potential solutions for CCMD operational needs emphasizing non-materiel solutions through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOT-LPF-P) improvements.  JCD&E tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JCD&E projects address topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  In partnership with the CCMDs and Services, JCD&E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards (FCB) who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.\n\nBased on leadership guidance, JS J7 shed themselves of the experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, the other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&E Management Support.  As a result, this line was zeroed and the remaining requirement was realigned to PE 0204571J, Joint Staff Analytical Support."

Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The Director for Joint Force Development (DJ-7) leads the joint force development efforts on behalf of the Chairman.  The J-7 staff coordinates all efforts with respect to the JCD&E Community.\n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&E initiatives originate from an annual call for nominations from CCMD's and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA).  JCD&E project submissions undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Community to confirm suitability for experimentation and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  Preliminary analysis also confirms alignment to the Chairman\u2019s priorities for developing Joint Force 2020 and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) strategic priority areas.  The resultant annual list of project submissions includes concepts for development and experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution. These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Synchronization Board and forwarded to the Joint Capabilities Board (JCB) and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) for approval.\n\nJCD&E activities examine potential solutions for CCMD operational needs emphasizing non-materiel solutions through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOT-LPF-P) improvements.  JCD&E tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design, and complex execution.  JCD&E projects address topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JCD&E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are provided to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.\n\nBased on leadership guidance, JS J7 shed themselves of the experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R2.

As part of the CJCS staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues.  JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues."

JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures. JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMD) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the US. It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues and for capabilities development and validation in support of the Unified Command Plan (UCP) assigned missions."

The outcome will validate the central idea of the concepts and discovered capability gaps to be considered for future concepts.  In support of the anticipated development of a follow-on to the current CCJO, a sequence of seminars engaging military and civilian DoD experts, academia, and think tanks on the future operations environment beyond 2020 was initiated and will conclude in FY15 with the publishing of a final report.  Other accomplishments include the completion and signing of the JCEO and JCRA plus implementation plans for JOAC, JCEO and JCRA, and the Joint Concept for Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JCJEMSO)."

The automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM DI effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment, and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency, and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  The Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.  Failure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, JS and OSD to efficiently manage force structure resources."

Applying small incremental amounts of investments to DoD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives."

It is a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in operationally relevant environments with Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the Special Operations Special Technology Development effort include:  \n\n   \u2022  Rapid Exploitation of Innovative Technologies (REITS).  This sub-project supports both top-down and bottom-up approaches for USSOCOM Components, Theater Special Operations Commands and Special Operations Task Forces to articulate innovative technology recommendations.  Concepts, ideas, and needs will be submitted to HQ USSOCOM for review and\/or approval as appropriate.  Technical activities in these areas will provide new operational capabilities and will mature technologies to better shape future SOF procurements.\n\n   \u2022  Special Technology Experimentation Sub-Project.  This sub-project conducts a variety of tactical network test bed venues working with the Naval Postgraduate School.\n\n \u2022  Special Technology Coalition Global Network Sub-Project.

This PE integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The PE also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase."

This includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis toolsets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media & Product Selection, Distribution & Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increase the efficiency and shorten the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware\/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  \n\nMISO Modernization.  This initiative will initiate and continue development of emergent technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize MISO planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by ATDs and JCTDs to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended MISO systems, especially in denied areas; focused\/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) radio transmitters and antenna; television (TV) transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of disseminating MISO products to reach target audiences across a wide variety of media into denied areas; and technologies that automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities."

The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensor data to find and fix enemy combatants and\/or terrorists.  The DCGS-SOF program is a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services within SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and Multi-National partners in support of a Joint Task Force.  It connects the SOF warfighter with essential intelligence information and provides situational awareness information to SOF leadership at all echelons.  The primary functions of DCGS-SOF are to conduct processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) for all SOF Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance sensors, permit the collection of SOF data from collection sensors and intelligence databases, share across the DCGS Integration Backbone and provide timely, tailored, all-source, fused intelligence reporting to the SOF warfighter.  This program will employ non-development commercial and government off-the-shelf hardware and software and will leverage from existing technology to the greatest degree possible."

The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensor data to find and fix enemy combatants and\/or terrorists.  The DCGS-SOF program is a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services within SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and Multi-National partners in support of a Joint Task Force.  It connects the SOF warfighter with essential intelligence information and provides situational awareness information to SOF leadership at all echelons.  The primary functions of DCGS-SOF are to conduct processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) for all SOF Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, permit the collection of SOF data from collection sensors and intelligence databases, share across the DCGS Integration Backbone and provide timely, tailored, all-source, fused intelligence reporting to the SOF warfighter.  This program will employ non-development commercial and government off-the-shelf hardware and software and will leverage from existing technology to the greatest degree possible."

As the supported combatant command, USSOCOM has been designated as the DoD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This project addresses the primary areas of ISR&T."

Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2001.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Awards are up to $0.100 million with a maximum six-month period of performance.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Awards are up to $0.750 million with a maximum two-year period of performance.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  DOD publishes government agency proposal projects twice per year for a consolidated DoD Request for Proposal.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects."

                            "val": "Aviation Systems:\nThis project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) terrain following\/terrain avoidance radar; Electronic Warfare (EW) - radio frequency countermeasures; Precision Strike Package (PSP) for MC-130W Multi-Mission Modification; AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; digital broadcast capabilities; and aerial refueling. \n\nCV-22 Development:\nThe CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.\nBlock 10: Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.\nBlock 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.\n\nMission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThis project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) systems to support mission planning and rehearsal  required to meet Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning and rehearsal capabilities. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning systems. \n\nAC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky airframes. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration. These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and provide close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft.\n\nRotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters"

This\nis a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid\nprototyping. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.\nBlock 10: Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.\nBlock 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous\ntesting. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform."

Block 10 RDT&E funding was sent from USSOCOM to NAVAIRSYSCOM to be placed on contract with the V-22 prime contractor. Block 10 capability is required for compliance with the Joint Operational Requirements Document and associated Milestone III Capabilities Production Document. Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV-22."

The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.\n\nSub-projects include:\n\u2022 Special Operations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE): Develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique\nrequirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to\ntime critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE\nprovides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF war-fighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.\n\n\u2022 MC\/AC-130J Simulator (MC\/AC-130J): Conducts analysis, development, integration, assembly, test and checkout of SOF-unique MC-130J and AC-130J simulator development efforts modifications to include, but not limited to, all efforts of technical and functional activities associated with the design, development, and production of mating surfaces, structures, equipment, parts, materiels, and software required to assemble equipment (hardware\/software) elements into training mission equipment as a whole and not directly part of any other individual element.\n\n\u2022 Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance Silent Knight Radar Simulator (TF\/TA SKR): Integrates, tests, and validates the SKR capability into the MH-47G and MH-60\ncombat mission simulators. This is a SOF-common multi-mode radar characterized by a Low Probability of Intercept\/ Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) capability."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration. These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. USSOCOM will then employ an incremental upgrade approach to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the Air Force-provided aircraft.\n\nConducts development, integration, and testing of aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, enhanced situational awareness, electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits.

Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts, and they must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification will address structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control replacement effort will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade (NDI\/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide basic situational awareness.  This upgrade is critical to keep a 1960's vintage aircraft in the fight until a suitable replacement aircraft is available, estimated to be in the 2025 timeframe.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.   \n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  Additional funding is provided to begin software development.\n\n\u2022   Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the Service Common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-peculiar modifications to the common aircraft. This is a new start in FY 2014\n\n\u2022   Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a lightweight capability suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).  The IRCM program will develop, integrate, qualify, and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and expendables dispenser.  The A\/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the U.S. Army inventory without protection from IR guided missiles.  IRCM is a new start in FY 2014."

The airframe\/rotors development effort will be a sole source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Goodrich Power and Engine Control (GPEC) under subcontract to Boeing.  As part of the airframe upgrade, the main and tail rotor blades are being replaced with one of several blades available off-the-shelf through a competitive evaluation.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins, with the intent to leverage the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) source code to the extent possible.  Any new hardware components will be NDI\/COTS and will be competitively selected.  The production software effort will be a FFP contract.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022   MH-60M SOF Modernization Program - This supports the Systems Integration and Qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter. This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. There are no proprietary considerations that may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   DVE - This effort integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution to the extent possible while capitalizing on Science and Technology initiatives and other Service DVE investments.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  Additional funds will be employed to begin the development of the software\/firmware for the Synthetic Vision Backbone which uses Digital Terrain Elevation Data or High Resolution digital elevation maps, Threat Data, and Blue Force Tracker.  This is combined with Q2 Electro-Optic Sighting System overlay and Silent Knight Radar or DVE sensors (not yet defined) to provide a synthetic vision scene to aid the aircrew in degraded visual environments. The Synthetic Vision Backbone is sensor agnostic, maximizing the use of a priori data with sensors used for change detection.\n\n\u2022   Future Vertical Lift (FVL) - New start in FY2014. This effort is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of the Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift Aviation capabilities over the next 40 years.   \n\n\u2022 Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) - New Start in FY2014. This program will be a competitive source selection effort that develops, integrates, and qualifies a mission configurable Missile Warning System (MWS) and IRCM capability which does not currently exist at a weight suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).  Special operations aviation requires the addition of IRCM to protect against increasingly proliferated and sophisticated infrared-guided weapons."

SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success."

Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.\n\n- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced automated data processing and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces.  The program consists of suites, mission planning kits and field computing devices."

Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments."

Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Special Operations Tactical Video System (SOTVS).\n\nU.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    \n\nOPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    \n\n\u2022   NSSS.  This program provides a research and development rapid prototyping capability which functions as HQ SOCOM's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands by leveraging National Agency and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units, to include field-deployed signal intelligence (SIGINT) and communications systems such as the Firefly SIGINT and Rapid Reliable Targeting (RRT) geo-location payload and future Friendly Force Trackers (FFT).  Similarly, the Enhanced Software-Defined Radio Tag effort will provide a unique, mission-relevant and globally flexible field device which will provide tactical forces the ability to clandestinely tag and persistently track almost any target, using multiple National Theater and Tactical collection platforms.\n\n\u2022   JTWS.  This program  is an evolutionary acquisition (EA) effort that provides threat warning, force protection, enhanced situational awareness, and target identification\/acquisition information to SOF via signal intercept, direction finding and SIGINT.  JTWS will employ continuing technology updates to address the changing threat environment.  SOF SIGINT operators are globally deployed and fully embedded within Special Operations teams and aircrews in every operational environment.  This state-of-the-art technology enables SOF operators to provide critical time-sensitive targeting and actionable intelligence to the operational commander during mission execution.  Intelligence derived from operations supports campaign objectives and the National Military Strategy.  This system has variants that utilize common technologies and interfaces allowing operators to task, organize, and scale equipment based on anticipated signal environments and areas of operation.  Variants will be modular; lightweight with minimal power requirements; and configurable to support body worn\/mobile or static, air, maritime and precision geo-location operations in support of all SOF missions.  Each variant, except static, will be capable of operation by a single trained operator.  The four variants are Ground SIGINT Kit (GSK) Bodyworn\/Mobile and Team Transportable (GSK static), Air, Maritime, and Precision Geo-Location (Ground and Air).\n\n\u2022  SOTVS.  This program employs an evolutionary strategy to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements. The program consists of a family of interoperable digital commercial-off-the-shelf systems to capture and transfer near-real time day\/night tactical ground imagery utilizing SOF organic radios and global C4I infrastructure.  The program provides the capability to forward imagery in near-real time via current or future communication systems (i.e., land-line, High Frequency, Very High Frequency, and Satellite Communications radios) in support of surveillance and reconnaissance missions. This man-packable tactical system consists of digital still cameras, camcorders, ruggedized laptop computers with image manipulation software and data controller.  This program is a FY 2014 new start.\n\nABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON)  \n\n\u2022   Counter-Proliferation Analysis and Planning Systems (CAPS).  Department of Defense (DoD) has a planning mission for counter-proliferation (CP) contingency operations.  CAPS has been identified by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as the standard CP planning tool set for DoD, and the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense Program has consolidated RDT&E funding at USSOCOM for overall program management. U.S. Strategic Command serves as the coordinator for CAPS requirements.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency provides science and technology expertise and integration support to enhance CAPS capabilities.  CAPS provides tools and assessments to DoD and SOF mission planners to aid in worldwide identification and analysis of suspected weapons of mass destruction and potential targets; assesses the associated effectiveness, costs and risks of various CP options and their collateral effects; and develops alternative plans.  CAPS is a primary source of CP mission planning information for Combatant Commanders who are the principal customers.  CAPS requires ongoing development, integration and testing of leading edge technology for operational planning and processes in order to provide the best possible engineering analysis and to support consequence engineering to meet changing threats.   CAPS program funding and responsibility transfers to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for consolidation and interface with DIA's Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction Analysis Cell beginning in FY 2014.\n\n\u2022   Special Operations Command Research and Threat Evaluation System (SOCRATES).  This program is an umbrella program that acquires and supports the network and computing infrastructure for SOF intelligence information up to and including the Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) level. SOCRATES integrates intelligence information from national, theater, Service and SOF-specific databases; provides news service and message traffic; automated imagery processing, dissemination, and archival; analyst-to-analyst electronic mail and collaborative tools; web interfaces\/search capabilities and browse-down capability to Secret web servers; and secure voice and facsimile. It provides a seamless and interoperable interface enabling SOF-unique intelligence support to mission planning and intelligence preparation of the battle space."

The CV-22 provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas.  This is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft.  The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments.  The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support.  The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008. \nBlock 10:  Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.  \nBlock 20:  Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform."

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification:  The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft.  The CV-22 will provide long range, high speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas.  This is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid prototyping.  The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support.  The Block 10 increment completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008. \nBlock 10:  Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.  \nBlock 20:  Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform."

This ensures that the CV-22 changes are incorporated into the ongoing V-22 production line with minimum impact.  Funding for the baseline CV-22 Engineering Manufacturing and Development, known as Block 0, is embedded in the Navy budget.  Block 10 RDT&E funding was sent from USSOCOM to NAVAIRSYSCOM to be placed on contract with the V-22 prime contractor.  Block 10 capability is required for compliance with the Joint Operational Requirements Document and associated Milestone III Capabilities Production Document.  Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV-22."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and provide close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.

                            "val": "This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensor, munition and military information support operations (MISO) systems.  The efforts within this PE improves Special Operations Forces (SOF) war fighting capabilities, by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  \n\nWarrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.    SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.\n\nTactical Systems Development:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. \n\nCommunications Equipment and Electronics Systems:\nThis project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their war fighting capability without degrading their mobility.  Therefore, SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.\n\nTactical Radio Systems:\nThis project is for development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their war fighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, and Communication (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied\/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.\n\nWeapons Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Current efforts include; but are not limited to the life cycle replacement of the MK13 by the Precision Sniper Rifle and an anti-materiel rifle that will pursue heavy sniper system technology to provide SOF with precision engagement capabilities on materiel target.  In the weapons accessories program, efforts are currently focusing on muzzle brakes and suppressors and P3I for a variety of accessories, both individual and crew served by leveraging the latest technological advances in optical accessories.  \n\nSoldier Protection and Survival Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system improvements and testing to meet the continual changing technology on the battlefield. \n\nTheater Body Armor and Associated Equipment:\nNote:  The National Defense Authorization Act of 2010 directed a separate project (S385A) be created for ballistic protection efforts.\nThis project provides specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF with ballistic protection.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project funding enhances the SPEAR program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment to meet the current ballistic threats that exists on the battlefield.\n\nVisual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirement of SOF.  Programs in this area include; but are not limited to  binocular\/monocular devices, visual augmentation for both crew-served and individual systems; leveraging the latest technological advances.  A current capability shortfalls identified by the SOF is the ability to detect, classify, and engage targets out to 800 meters without the use of an infra-red illuminator. \n\nMunitions Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  (Including bullet impact, fast cook off, fragment impact, slow cook off, sympathetic detonation, and shaped charge test.)  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM  IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also support efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM); including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.\n\nMISO:\nThis project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders."

SOF Communications Advanced Development is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   \n\nUSSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. \n\n \u2022 SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of satellite communications systems that includes the following variants:  heavy, medium, and light.  This program consists of a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, satellite communications (SATCOM) systems capable of supporting high-capacity, voice, data, and video services at all levels of classification.\n\n\u2022  The Special Communications Enterprise program (SPCOM) includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field).

SOF often deploys as small, independent, quick reaction, foot-mobile teams independent of primary logistics support. Existing weapons and combat equipment are frequently unsuited to these conditions.  Sub-projects include:\n\nFamily of Sniper Weapon Systems (FSWS). This program includes next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I) to current sniper systems.  Next-generation systems include two variants: a (PSR) as a life cycle replacement of the current .300 Winchester Magnum rifle (MK13) that is intended to provide SOF with a highly accurate weapon system capable of engaging targets at ranges equal to or better than the MK13, and an anti-materiel rifle that will pursue heavy sniper system technology to provide SOF with precision engagement capabilities on materiel targets.\n\nWeapons Accessories (WPNAC).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions\/capabilities) such as day scopes, clip-on night scopes, active aiming laser module, visible lights, grenade launchers, suppressors, hand grips, and close quarters battle sights. Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for Crew-served Weapons enhances all SOF weapons, by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS), and Family of Muzzle Breaks and Suppressors (FMBS).  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors to develop suppressors and flashhiders for select SOF weapon systems. These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."

Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment and load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\n\u2022 SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) program provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system (VAS) mounts.  NOTE: In compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, resources to support ballistic protection efforts were moved from SPEAR to a separate project (S385A) beginning in FY 2012.\n\n\u2022 Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC program procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication,  mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. \n\n\u2022 Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future radio controlled improvised explosive devices threats used by terrorist networks.  NOTE: The Counter RC-IED efforts were conducted in the program element 1160408BB.  The resources for these efforts were split beginning in FY 2013 to support the SOF theater force requirements."

These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\nThis budget line enhances the SPEAR program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment. Creation of a separate project for ballistic protection efforts was directed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010."

Specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations within harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorist, or highly sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success.\n\nVisual Augmentation Systems (VAS).  This program develops, buys prototypes, and supports fielding of operator-borne combat optics for SOF.  These devices provide the SOF operator the ability to maneuver, conduct fire control operations, and perform surveillance and reconnaissance.  Research and Development efforts will develop, test, and evaluate prototype systems of the next generation Fusion system.\n\nThese Visual Augmentation Systems will provide an all-weather, low-light capability for SOF personnel by employing a Block approach.  This Block approach produces a family of VAS systems which will utilize a variety of different sensor technologies to satisfy the capabilities defined by individual Block requirement.  Some examples of the types of sensor technologies that these systems may utilize include:  Image Intensification, Thermal, Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) and\/or multi-spectral.  To date the Target Engagement Portfolio has utilized several Block system approaches that have been fielded by the VAS program.  These VAS programs will be a developmental effort to produce and field the next generation systems for SOF personnel.  Some of the capability shortfalls identified by the SOF community are the following: (1) ability to detect, classify, and engage targets out to 800 m without the use of an infra-red illuminator; (2) ability to determine wind speed at ranges out to 500 m or greater and (3) ability to observe bullet trace at ranges of 800 m or greater.\n\nVisual Augmentation Systems Weapons Accessories (VASWA).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions \/ capabilities) such as combat optics, aiming laser modules, visible lights, and close quarters battle sights.  Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for crew-served weapons enhances all SOF Weapons by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew-served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), VAS and clandestine pointer.  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs.  Also, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors in order to develop clandestine operator-borne visual augmentation devices.  These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. \n\n\u2022 The MISO Broadcast System consists of fixed and deployable multi-media production facilities for radio and television programming, distribution systems, and dissemination systems to provide MISO support to theater commanders. This project is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or interoperate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements. This project includes the fixed site media production center; a light and medium media production capability; a product distribution system that provides a reachback link to systems worldwide; a media system; a transit case fly-away broadcast systems that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio\/TV production systems; and a long range broadcast system (LRBS) which transmits analog and digital broadcasts. The LRBS will include scatterable media, telephony, and Internet broadcast. MISO media displays will consist of easily transportable, state of the art, electronic media displays designed to disseminate and broadcast electronic messages designed to influence foreign target audiences, and will support the MISO direct broadcast mission requirements. Additionally, lightweight and tactical media development work stations will allow soldiers to produce MISO products in deployed locations."

The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.   SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, and Communication (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied\/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments."

The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their war-fighting capability without degrading their mobility.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.   Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments."

SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.

SOF often deploys as small, independent, quick reaction, foot-mobile teams independent of primary logistics support. Existing weapons and combat equipment are frequently unsuited to these conditions.  Sub-projects include:\n\nFamily of Sniper Weapon Systems (FSWS). This program includes next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I) to current sniper systems.  Next-generation systems include two variants: a (PSR) as a life cycle replacement of the current .300 Winchester Magnum rifle (MK13) that is intended to provide SOF with a highly accurate weapon system capable of engaging targets at ranges equal to or better than the MK13, and an anti-materiel rifle that will pursue heavy sniper system technology to provide SOF with precision engagement capabilities on materiel targets.\n\nWeapons Accessories (WPNAC).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions\/capabilities) such as day scopes, clip-on night scopes, active aiming laser module, visible lights, grenade launchers, suppressors, hand grips, and close quarters battle sights. Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for Crew-served Weapons enhances all SOF weapons, by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS), and Family of Muzzle Breaks and Suppressors (FMBS).  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors to develop suppressors and flashhiders for select SOF weapon systems.

Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment and load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\n\u2022 SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) program provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system (VAS) mounts.  NOTE: In compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, resources to support ballistic protection efforts were moved from SPEAR to a separate project (S385A) beginning in FY 2012.\n\n\u2022 Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC program procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including,but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication,  mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. \n\n\u2022 Radio Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future radio controlled improvised explosive devices threats used by terrorist networks.  NOTE: The RC-IED efforts were conducted in the program element 1160408BB.  The resources for these efforts were split beginning in FY 2013 to support the SOF theater force requirements."

Specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success."

Specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations within harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorist, or highly sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success.\n\nVisual Augmentation Systems (VAS).  This program develops, buys prototypes, and supports fielding of operator-borne combat optics for SOF.  These devices provide the SOF operator the ability to maneuver, conduct fire control operations, and perform surveillance and reconnaissance.  Research and Development efforts will develop, test, and evaluate prototype systems of the next generation Fusion system.\n\nThese Visual Augmentation Systems will provide an all-weather, low-light capability for SOF personnel by employing a Block approach.  This Block approach produces a family of VAS systems which will utilize a variety of different sensor technologies to satisfy the capabilities defined by individual Block requirement.  Some examples of the types of sensor technologies that these systems may utilize include:  Image Intensification, Thermal, Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) and\/or multi-spectral.  To date the Target Engagement Portfolio has utilized several Block system approaches that have been fielded by the VAS program.  These VAS programs will be a developmental effort to produce and field the next generation systems for SOF personnel.  Some of the capability shortfalls identified by the SOF community are the following: (1) ability to detect, classify, and engage targets out to 800 m without the use of an infra-red illuminator; (2) ability to determine wind speed at ranges out to 500 m or greater and (3) ability to observe bullet trace at ranges of 800 m or greater.\n\nVisual Augmentation Systems Weapons Accessories (VASWA).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions \/ capabilities) such as combat optics, aiming laser modules, visible lights, and close quarters battle sights.  Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for crew-served weapons enhances all SOF Weapons by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew-served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), VAS and clandestine pointer.  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs.  Also, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors in order to develop clandestine operator-borne visual augmentation devices.  These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."

Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts, and they must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification will address structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control replacement effort will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade (NDI\/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide basic situational awareness.  This upgrade is critical to keep a 1960's vintage aircraft in the fight until a suitable replacement aircraft is available, estimated to be in the 2025 timeframe.\n\n\u2022  Hostile Fire Indicating System (HFIS) detects, classifies, and alerts the aircrew to the presence of small arms and crew served weapons fire for SOF MH-47\/60 platforms.  By providing detection and angle of arrival information, the HFIS will allow the aircrew to perform evasive and counter-fire actions significantly increasing the aircraft's probability of survival .  The Helicopter Survivability Task Force (HSTF) funds incorporated Hostile Fire Indication in the Infrared Spectrum as well as provided sensor fusion of Infrared, Ultra-Violet, and acoustic sensors to reduce false alarms and increase probability of detection.  \n\n\u2022   The MH-47 Engine Automatic Re-Light (EARL) system will detect the presence of an impending or an in-progress engine flame-out event and re-establish combustion within the engine to avoid an actual engine flame-out.  EARL will recognize the event much faster than a pilot and then proceed to reignite\/restart the engine while monitoring and adjusting engine parameters including the ignition system and fuel flow scheduling.  \n\n\u2022   MH-47 Low Cost Modifications program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and Engine Barrier Filter.\n\n\u2022   Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program procures a laser rangefinder and designator to the ANZSQ-3.  The program also procures and installs the Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) drop-in, advanced dual color (long and mid-wave) IR detector upgrade for the ANZSQ-2 NGFLIR on the light and heavy assault platforms within the Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) fleet.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.   \n\n\u2022   Reduced Optical Signature Emissions Solution (ROSES) program provides reduced optical signature of the current infrared expendable decoys for purposes of reducing Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) aircraft vulnerabilities.  This flare solution will have the capability to decoy currently fielded infrared missiles and more sophisticated emerging threats. \n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  Additional funding is provided to begin software development."

The airframe\/rotors development effort will be a sole source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Goodrich Power and Engine Control (GPEC) under subcontract to Boeing.  As part of the airframe upgrade, the main and tail rotor blades are being replaced with one of several blades available off-the-shelf through a competitive evaluation.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins, with the intent to leverage the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) source code to the extent possible.  Any new hardware components will be NDI\/COTS and will be competitively selected.  The production software effort will be a FFP contract.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022   HFIS - This effort will develop, integrate, install, and field the capability to detect, classify, and alert the aircrew to the presence of small arms fire, anti-aircraft artillery, and rocket propelled grenades.  HFIS will allow aircrews to perform evasive and counter-fire actions, which will increase aircraft survivability and mission success.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the HFIS effort to the extent possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. The HSTF funds incorporated Hostile Fire Indication in the Infrared Spectrum as well as provided sensor fusion of Infrared, Ultra-violet, and acoustic sensors to reduce false alarms and increase probability of detection.   \n \n\u2022   MH-47 EARL system - This effort develops and qualifies a solution to address safety issues in the MH-47 fleet through the development, test, qualification, and fielding of changes to the engine control system to perform automatic engine failure detection and flame-out protection. Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022  MH-47 Low Cost Modifications  - This efforts develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS, ANC, and Engine Barrier Filter.  This effort will consist mostly of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be procured.  Because of proprietary considerations, efforts may be directed to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   MH-60M SOF Modernization Program - This supports the Systems Integration and Qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter. This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. There are no proprietary considerations that may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   ROSES - This effort developed and qualified a flare solution that discharges fewer expendables per dispense and emits less visible light to improve aircrew's ability to survive in sophisticated threat environments.  Proprietary issues with the existing flare and lack of suitable alternatives (based upon market research) dictated a sole source contract with the current manufacturer as the best value to the Government.\n\n\u2022   DVE - This effort integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution to the extent possible while capitalizing on Science and Technology initiatives and other Service DVE investments.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. Additional funds will be employed to begin the development of the software\/firmware for the Synthetic Vision Backbone which uses Digital Terrain Elevation Data or High Resolution digital elevation maps, Threat Data, and Blue Force Tracker.  This is  combined with Q2 Electro-Optic Sighting System overlay and Silent Knight Radar or DVE sensors (not yet defined) to provide a synthetic vision scene to aid the aircrew in degraded visual environments. The Synthetic Vision Backbone is sensor agnostic, maximizing the use of a priori data with sensors used for change detection."

This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, systems, and equipment are used by Special Operations Forces (SOF) in the conduct of infiltration\/extraction, hydrographic\/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:   \n\n\u2022   Combat Submersibles:  Includes incorporating obsolescence solutions and conducting product improvement efforts for the in-service SEAL Delivery Vehicle MK 8 and conducting technology development and engineering and manufacturing development for the follow-on combat submersibles such as the various types of shallow water combat submersibles.  The shallow water combat submersibles use an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop a family of submersibles, to include a new wet submersible capable of operating from existing Dry Deck Shelters, and more capable wet and\/or dry submersibles that will operate from future large submarine shelters\/systems and\/or surface ships.  The combat submersible sub-project leverages existing SEAL Delivery Vehicle components, develops new state-of-the-art components where appropriate, and leases or purchases commercial-off-the-shelf components and vehicles for test and evaluation and operational assessment.\n\n\u2022   Underwater Support Systems and Equipment:  Includes conducting product improvement efforts for in-service submarine support systems such as the Dry Deck Shelters, unmanned underwater vehicles such as the Semi-autonomous Hydrographic Reconnaissance Vehicle, and diver equipment such as the Hydrographic Mapping Unit, Non-gasoline Burning Outboard Engines and Diver Propulsion Devices.   Also provides for technology development and engineering and manufacturing development, and studies and analysis for follow-on underwater systems and support equipment."

This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for surface craft and equipment, such as the light and heavy combatant crafts that are currently being studied in the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System process.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include: \n\nThe Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) sub-project provides a family of next generation combatant craft to replace the current rigid inflatable boat (RIB) and the MKV.  One version of these craft will be a reconfigurable, multi-mission surface tactical mobility craft with a primary mission of insertion and extraction of SOF in a medium threat environment.  It will incorporate additional performance capabilities above current platform capabilities such as shock mitigation, low observability, improved maneuverability and SOF warfighting capabilities required to operate in future threat environments.  Other variants of craft will be developed to support foreign security assistance missions and operations in low or permissive threat environments.  These variants are dependent on the threat environment, training requirement, or mission.\n\nThe Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH) sub-project represents a family of solutions that will provide engineering support for design and specification of a development combatant craft for movement and maneuver of  SOF personnel.  Requirements include maneuverability, reduced detectability with enhanced shock mitigation, and human systems integration.  Potential solution for Combatant Craft Heavy is the Sea, Air, and Land Teams Insertion, Observation and Neutralization (SEALION) that was developed as an advanced technology prototype by the United States Navy and may be modified and tested for transition to SOF operations.  Additional studies may be performed to support analysis of SOF-peculiar needs for an Afloat Staging Base to command, control, sustain, launch and recover Joint SOF.\n\nThe Next Generation Combat Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (CCFLIR) sub-project provides SOF with daylight, high resolution, and additional spectrum imaging capabilities to augment existing optical and radar sensors.  Technology insertion is needed to enhance the detection, recognition, identification, and tracking of small and near surface targets and ships.  This program is an FY 2014 new start.\n\nThe Next Generation Surface Systems (NGSRF) sub-project provides a rapid response capability to support SOF Combatant Craft Systems and subsystems.  The NGSRF will explore solutions to support emerging requirements in support of SOF exercises and training for future missions.  It provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability through the means of feasibility studies, analyses of alternatives, pre-developmental risk reduction, and engineering analyses.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as but not limited to, weapons mounts, sensors, enhanced communications and navigation subsystems, and other minor modifications to craft in support of future missions.  Solutions may be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, other agency solutions or new solutions.  This program is an FY 2014 new start."

Acquisition strategies for other craft may be based on the rapid acquisition of available non-developmental commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)\/government-off-the-shelf craft.   \n\nCombatant Craft Heavy acquisition strategy is to complete the initial planning and studies for the craft, which will be performed in-house with some support from other government agencies or existing contract services.  \n\nNext Generation Surface Systems and Subsystems to include the Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar will explore the spectrum of acquisition strategies depending on selection of COTS solutions, modification of existing systems, or new competitive acquisitions."

This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for surface craft and equipment, such as the light and heavy combatant crafts that are currently being studied in the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System process.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include: \n\n\u2022   The Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) sub-project provides a family of next generation combatant craft to replace the current rigid inflatable boat (RIB) and the MKV.  One version of these craft will be a reconfigurable, multi-mission surface tactical mobility craft with a primary mission of insertion and extraction of SOF in a medium threat environment.  It will incorporate additional performance capabilities above current platform capabilities such as shock mitigation, low observability, improved maneuverability and SOF warfighting capabilities required to operate in future threat environments.  Other variants of craft will be developed to support foreign security assistance missions and operations in low or permissive threat environments.  These variants are dependent on the threat environment, training requirement, or mission.\n\n\u2022   The Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH) sub-project represents a family of solutions that will provide engineering support for design and specification of a development combatant craft for movement and maneuver of  SOF personnel.  Requirements include maneuverability, reduced detectability with enhanced shock mitigation, and human systems integration.  Potential solution for Combatant Craft Heavy is the Sea, Air, and Land Teams Insertion, Observation and Neutralization (SEALION) that was developed as an advanced technology prototype by the United States Navy and may be modified and tested for transition to SOF operations.  Additional studies may be performed to support analysis of SOF-peculiar needs for an Afloat Staging Base to command, control, sustain, launch and recover Joint SOF.\n\n\u2022   The Next Generation Combat Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (CCFLIR) sub-project provides SOF with daylight, high resolution, and additional spectrum imaging capabilities to augment existing optical and radar sensors.  Technology insertion is needed to enhance the detection, recognition, identification, and tracking of small and near surface targets and ships.  This program is an FY 2014 new start.\n\n\u2022   The Next Generation Surface Systems (NGSRF) sub-project provides a rapid response capability to support SOF Combatant Craft Systems and subsystems.  The NGSRF will explore solutions to support emerging requirements in support of SOF exercises and training for future missions.  It provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability through the means of feasibility studies, analyses of alternatives, pre-developmental risk reduction, and engineering analyses.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as but not limited to, weapons mounts, sensors, enhanced communications and navigation subsystems, and other minor modifications to craft in support of future missions.  Solutions may be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, other agency solutions or new solutions.  This program is an FY 2014 new start."

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. The MISO sub-projects funded are grouped by the level of organization they support.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022   The MISO Broadcast System consists of fixed and deployable multi-media production facilities for radio and television programming, distribution systems, and dissemination systems to provide MISO support to theater commanders. This program is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or interoperate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements. This program includes the fixed site media production center; a light and medium media production capability; a distribution system that provides a product distribution link to systems worldwide; a media system; a transit case Fly-Away Broadcast System (FABS) that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio\/TV production systems; software defined radio and a long range broadcast system which transmits analog and digital broadcasts. The long range broadcast system will include, scatterable media, telephony, and Internet broadcast. MISO media displays will consist of easily transportable, state of the art, electronic media displays designed to disseminate and direct broadcast electronic messages, which will influence foreign target audiences, and will support the MISO direct broadcast mission requirements.  Additionally, lightweight and tactical media development work stations will allow soldiers to produce MISO products in deployed locations."

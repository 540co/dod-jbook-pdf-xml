This project is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health. \n\nThe Combatting Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria (CARB) research program was established in response to Presidential direction in late 2013 to create a National Strategy to address the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance. This effort's focus is on the development of new\/novel antibiotics, especially those targeting the most resistant and worrisome Gram negative bacterial pathogens, using existing expertise at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and leveraging other WRAIR capabilities to evaluate viable candidate targets for advanced discovery. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities to respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern.\n\nThe cited work is also consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas, and supports the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases to include HIV."

The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battle space focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness. \n\nThis Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).

To address the challenges of integrating multiple technologies and sub-systems, research conducted in this PE, significant Science and Technology applied research investments in all areas of Soldier Lethality, focus on how to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes and apply systems-level practices to mitigate constraints from size and weight of the equipment. Research areas encompass individual and crew-served weapon designs and technologies as well as applied research in lightweight and transparent armor materials to mitigate effects from blast and ballistic threats, counter explosive hazard detection, counter-sensor capabilities, and signature management of weapons, equipment, personnel and high value targets. This PE investigates, develops and designs materials, technologies, methodologies and system models required to experiment and optimize Soldier lethality and survivability through investments in mobility, human-agent teaming, and improved situational awareness interfaces and display technologies as well as to provide Soldier-borne power and energy materials and components that support multiple Soldier-borne systems. This PE also investigates Warfighter training technologies and develops the underpinning technologies to establish architecture standards and interfaces necessary for creating realistic synthetic environments to create a single, interconnected synthetic training system to enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon \/ multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. Human Factors Engineering projects conduct applied research to design weapon systems standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training curriculum and tools. \n\nResults of these efforts are transitioned within the Army Futures Command, the Program Executive Offices, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology).\n\nAll FY21 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Research encompasses conducting applied research to develop metrics, measures, tools, and techniques to quantify and understand the relationships that enable maximum effectiveness of integrated Soldier-augmentation technologies. The resulting data are the basis for physical augmentation systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, and intelligent agent requirements to improve equipment operation and Soldier-system synergy. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, reduced Soldier training requirements, enhanced Soldier lethality\/survivability, user acceptance, and allow Soldiers to achieve maximum performance. Major efforts explore novel techniques for Soldier assessment, characterization of individual variability effects on performance, development of evidence based design guidance for the application of augmentation technologies, exploration of the relationship of exoskeleton and physical assist device adaptation and baseline Soldier parameters such as gait, neuromuscular motor control and proprioception. This Project will also explore novel training paradigms for reduced Soldier-augmentation technology adaptation times to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit wearable sensor technologies, translate surrogate task performance to operational outcomes, develop approaches to distinguish tasks and individual state and intent of movement, establish database of human movement variability to inform intelligent system design, and identify high impact applications of augmentation.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and leverages the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ Project BC2 (Next Gen Mobility & Lethality Tech for Warfighters), Project BB9 (Human Performance Tech for Mobility & Lethality), Project BC6 (Human Perf - Tech for Warfighter Enhancement), and Project BB7 (Exoskeleton: Technology for Man-Machine Interface); and supports PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) \/ Project BC1 (Human Performance AdvTech for Mobility & Lethality), Project BB6 (Physical Augmentation: Adv Tech for Field Demo), and Project BB8 (Soldier Centric Advanced Technology). Additionally, work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the Medical Research and Development Command under the Military Operational Medicine Research Program within PE 0602787A (Medical Technology) \/ Project 869 (Warfighter Health Prot & Perf Stnds), and the Veteran Administration's exoskeleton research area. This Project also complements and is fully coordinated with work performed across Army, Navy, and Air Force under the Reliance 21 Human Systems Community of Interest: Protection, Sustainment, and Warfighter Performance and with our international partners through The Technical Cooperation Program \/ Human Resources and Performance Group \/ Panel JP1 (TTCP HUM JP1).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The resulting data are the basis for physical augmentation systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, and intelligent agent requirements to improve equipment operation and Soldier-system synergy. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, reduced Soldier training requirements, enhanced Soldier lethality\/survivability, user acceptance, and allows the Soldier and systems to jointly achieve maximum performance. Major efforts explore novel techniques for Soldier assessment, characterization of individual variability effects on performance, and development of evidence based design guidance for the application of augmentation technologies to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit wearable sensor technologies, translate surrogate task performance to operational outcomes, develop approaches to distinguish tasks and individual state, establish database of human movement variability to inform intelligent system design, and identify high impact applications of augmentation.\n\nResults of these efforts supports key Army needs and leverages the technical research of PEs 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) and 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology). Additionally, this work complements and supports the Medical Research and Development Command under PE 0602787A (Medical Technology), Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The result is increased mission effectiveness that enables strong mission command, intelligence operations, and cyber defenses, which lead to high information sharing, situational awareness, and collaboration. Major efforts focus on applied research to understand the conduct of effective cyber electromagnetic operations in that knowledge is required to create and effectively deploy cyber work systems that optimize human-machine interactions and account for operator and adversary behavior to achieve maximum effects. This Project also investigates technologies to quantify, predict, and enhance Squad-level shared Soldiers' situational awareness (SA) and understanding (SU) across volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambitious operating environments leading to demonstrated increases in mission effectiveness. The result of this effort will be systems that use real-time opportunistic measures of Soldier SA to adapt autonomous assets (routes, surveillance targets, etc.) based on dynamic needs of the Soldier\/Squad due to changing mission environment. In addition, this Project will develop novel technologies and approaches to represent uncertain and dynamically changing information in a manner that is effective and quickly understood with reduced Soldier\/Squad burden and minimal training requirements.\n\nResults of these efforts are provided to Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Program Managers, Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

This Project conducts research in immersive virtual, mixed, and augmented reality environments that stimulate human senses (e.g. sight, sound, and touch) and also conducts experiments to understand how users interface with the technology in order to improve the realism of simulation environments and therefore create enhanced immersion and more effective training systems. Research is also conducted to support the modernization of the current Live Training Environment (LTE) to allow fair fight engagements across all training environments and training devices.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC) and at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the University of Southern California."

Technologies to be investigated may include: algorithms for dismounted robotic systems to enable autonomous navigation, automated object recognition, persistent surveillance, launch and recovery from vehicles, networked lethality, manned- unmanned teaming, and collaborative behaviors; and advanced user interfaces to optimize human-robotic interaction during dismounted operations. These advanced technologies will enable Squad and Platoon level autonomous reconnaissance using robotic systems to minimize the operator's dedicated control of the systems and reduce their cognitive burden, thus allowing Soldiers to be more lethal and survivable.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and leverages the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) \/ Project BD7 (Soldier Sys Interfaces\/Integration-Sensor AdvTech) and Project BC9 (Adv Soldier Sensors\/Displays AdvTech for Dismounts).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

STE Information Systems (STE-IS) delivers the Common Synthetic Environment consisting of Global Terrain\/One World Terrain (OWT), Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The STE will be available where training occurs (home station, combat training centers, armories, institutions, shipboard, deployed) and will include Air and Ground Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCTs), a Soldier\/Squad Virtual Training (S\/SVT), and a live training capability. The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, including Live and Constructive. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.  \n\nThis effort is coordinated with work done in PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) \/ Project BE9 (Synthetic Training Environment (STE) Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the STE Cross Functional Team efforts.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC) and at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the University of Southern California"

Areas of emphasis include parachute technologies, parachutist injury reduction, precision offset aerial delivery, soft landing technologies, and airdrop simulation. Technologies support the Soldier Lethality Army Modernization Priority. New operational concepts call for increased precision of personnel and cargo in austere environments in which small units are dispersed and logistical supply is limited. The Army requires enhanced payload extraction and other increased capabilities to support the airdrop requirement for current and future vehicles exceeding aircraft payload weight capacity. TheU.S.  Army Airborne Board (Chaired by the XVIII Airborne Corps Commanding General) identified increased payload capabilities as a critical requirement to support the mission readiness profile for the Global Response Force (GRF), and will support Joint Forcible Entry requirements while maximizing the capacity of a C-17 aircraft.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and complements the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences), PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ Project BD6 (Soldier Sys Interfaces\/ Integration- Sensor Tech), and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) \/ Project BE5 (Personnel & Airdrop Safety Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Research in the area of novel parachute materials will provide increased capabilities for cargo and personnel aerial delivery systems. This effort will support an investigation of new Modeling and Simulation (M&S) tools in order to develop validation methods for airdrop concepts. This effort also investigates technologies that advance airborne personnel insertion safety requirements to modernize the Airborne Soldier and provide the ability to effectively execute the airborne mission through reducing safety risk and increasing capabilities."

It will close the gaps between commercial construction equipment and the requirements of the future Engineer Force to support maneuver, movement, and sustainment. This research will develop the capability to generate a near real-time site model with appropriate engineering details to allow unmanned shaping of the environment through physical interaction (e.g. push, pull, lift, or dig). This effort will also develop the requisite mission planner and task execution controller that accepts input from the user and provides suggestions and feedback based on updates to the site model, reporting from hardware agents, and resource allocation logic. The end state goal is the development of beyond visual line of sight teleoperation and semiautonomous capabilities allowing Engineer robotic support to match pace in near term and future combat environments. This effort will support the development, testing, and evaluation of prototypical robotic Combat Engineer equipment. This Project develops modeling and simulation tools that represent realistic states for Engineer robotic operations and develops and assesses semi-autonomous and autonomous construction equipment technologies needed for remote control Engineer operations.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project is conducted by the United States (US) Army Engineer Research and Development Center and coordinated with US Army Futures Command.\n\nWork in this Project is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and complements PE 063119A (Ground Advanced Technology)."

This Project will enable future crews to perform complex missions with increasingly sophisticated technologies, and in increasingly complex, dynamic socio-technical environments. The applied research will provide the fundamental technologies to enable integrated performance-improving Learning - Warfighter Machine Interfaces (WMIs) that are scalable to multiple crew hardware and functional configurations; reconfigurable frameworks and simulation for concept experimentation and exploration; and team-centered dynamic tasking by machine intelligence to effectively utilize full capabilities of crew and technologies. The research will generate soldier-informed data, reports, and analysis to support operational use in future vehicles through soldier experimentation and assessment of technical concepts in simulation and in-field WMIs. The capabilities created by this research will lead to increased overall crew and team performance; improved soldier safety due to fewer soldier per vehicle, closed-hatch operations, and improved standoff from effective control; and vehicles that can effectively perform across multiple domains of battle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NCVG).\n\n Work in this effort is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command.\n\nThis work is done in coordination with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and PE 0602143 (Soldier Lethality Technology)."

This work also investigates power distribution and conversion technologies to provide compact, efficient, and high power capabilities for electrical and electro-mechanical loads supporting both mobile and stationary unmanned platforms. Research enables combat vehicles to rapidly learn, adapt, and reason faster than the adversary; accomplish missions in contested, austere and congested environments, characterized by lack of structure, adversarial actions, and minimal a priori knowledge; and provide force reduction through self-learning vehicles that can operate in complex militarily relevant environments. This Project also matures emerging research leading to potential technology development in areas of strategic importance to the Army by bringing competitively selected Universities with research teams into Technical Alliances.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command.\n\nThis work is done in coordination with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology)."

Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to develop algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI\/ML techniques to develop intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAS mapped areas. Data collected from the UAS will be converted to maneuverable information for manned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go\/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV).\n\nWork in this effort is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command.\n\nThis work is coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicles Advanced Technology)."

This Project provides system level ground vehicle design concepts and performance analysis, assesses cost and performance trades, and provides real-time soldier feedback on technology performance for the Army's NGCVs. Technologies to be evaluated include high efficiency advanced powertrains, power generation, active protection systems, active blast, advanced lethality and robotic control and autonomy technologies.  The NGCV virtual experiments provide an efficient means to give warfighters an up-front, virtual hands-on operational evaluation of next generation ground vehicle concepts and emerging technologies. The Virtual Prototyping results provide critical inputs to the Army's NGCV program by providing independent technical and operational performance results, as well as assessing trades for the Army's next generation of ground combat vehicles.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority NGCV.\n\nWork in this effort is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command.\n\nWork in this Project is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology)."

The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and distributed sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by distributed electronics is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF and optoelectronic circuits, devices, materials and wireless power (and data) transfer. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

This research is critical to counter near-peer ability to geo-locate our troops and put indirect fires onto our positions. This effort develops a holistic cross-domain analysis and assessment methodology for network and communication technologies faced with advanced CEMA. These investigations are critical to identifying vulnerabilities of United States systems and technologies so that network and network-enabled systems can be hardened as early in development as possible.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

New atmospheric sensing technologies are developed that enable near-real-time, high-resolution measurements of atmospheric parameters via light-weight systems that can be employed in tactical domains. Efforts include high-resolution local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions that can accommodate the effects of dense urban and complex, mountainous terrain. Both physics-based and rule-based decision support systems are developed for assessing the impacts of weather\/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution; battlefield visualization; reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web-enabled tactical decision aids, long-range precision fires; and modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games\n\nThis work provides technologies for evaluation by and\/or transitions to the Department of Defense weather and operations community including: Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammunition-PM Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for meteorological message input to field artillery targeting systems; Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A); the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) to improve their operational weather support to the Army.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

This Project develops technologies addressing the PNT's toughest Scenario - Scenario 4 (no available GPS signal during the mission duration) with a goal of enabling Soldier missions of up to seven days in a GPS denied environment. This is achieved with research addressing advanced quantum timing circuits, advanced inertial measurement unit (IMU) components, multi-sensor modalities, perception techniques, geo-location data, vision aided navigation sensors, and available RF signals.\n\nThis research also addresses the PNT Scenarios 1 (GPS operations that start good and have degraded GPS signals throughout the mission duration) through Scenario 3 (GPS operations have 'bad' or limited availability of GPS signals throughout the entire mission). This is achieved with research addressing the ability to transmit jam-resistant, precision timing synchronized signals using optical fibers, free-space using lasers, and in the radio frequency (RF) domain using innovative RF antenna concepts to extend the reach of Soldier compatible capabilities in heavily contested GPS environments.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to RF communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution. Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of five key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, wireless power transfer, and advanced battery chemistries.  Additionally, materials and devices used for photonic applications, such as laser diodes and fiber lasers, will be studied and improved with an emphasis on overall size, weight, and power consumption efficiency gains."

Research focuses on infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in all operational environments. This Project designs, fabricates, and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational understanding, persistent surveillance, and hostile fire detection. This Project investigates and designs novel sensor electronics such as Digital Read Out Integrated Circuits (DROICs) to enable multifunction sensing. This Project also investigates and matures new semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from the periodic table. In addition, this Project develops algorithms for enhanced IR functionality, which provides the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets. The reduction of size, weight and power - Cost (SWaP-C) is a key research objective for all efforts.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Focus areas are sensor components, sub-components, and software algorithms to improve detection of mines and explosive threats; novel methods to defeat mines and explosive threats; and signature management technologies to reduce the reconnaissance capabilities of enemy forces. The technologies being investigated are for both mounted and dismounted applications. Project H24 (Countermine Technology) investigates state of the art counter explosive hazard technologies to accurately detect and neutralize threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo. Project H35 (Camouflage and Counter-Recon Tech) designs and develops advanced sensor protection, signature management, and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions. \n\nWork in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military-unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes associated with contingency operations worldwide. These new and innovative technologies empower rapid fielding of next generation energetics, propellants and munitions with focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond, and deliver the capability to shape and protect Army investments in next generation fires by delivering proactive, scientifically sound risk and environmental impact management strategies. This Project will also provide integrated knowledge of environmental factors in mission planning activities creating a unified, comprehensive and integrated battlefield landscape of future threats, opportunities and impacts to mission success in sparse data environments enabling mission planners to identify the industrial\/commercial resources used as components of weapons development. These resultant technologies streamline the acquisition process, enabling rapid fielding of new materials, increase Army readiness through proactive hazard management strategies for military materials, enhance the Army's ability to improve decision-making based on accurate environmental conditions in sparse data environments, and reduce Army liabilities associated with unforeseen environmental impacts.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and develops software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and develops materiel solutions, including rapidly emplaced bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with protective construction and critical infrastructure. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to assess non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy..\n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology).\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, and homeland security. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the capability of autonomous engineering during combat operations to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk\/threat and dynamic environments, enables installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and on-demand expeditionary structures, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in contingency operations, including urban environments.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi."

The Sys Bio Cube (a biomedical research data integration and analysis system), managed by the SBCC, provides the ability for multi-site collaborative efforts to integrate, visualize and evaluate complex data using innovative technologies. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and coagulopathy (a disorder that impairs the blood's ability to form clots) projects have utilized the systems biology analytical tools and visualization within the Sys Bio Cube to inform the development of prognostic indicators, objective diagnostics, and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies more quickly than non-systems approaches. The SBCC also serves as a US Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) resource for data sharing and data management for maximizing the value of all research efforts across the Command.\n\nProject XV5: Medical Capabilities to Support Dispersed Ops\nDescription: Research to design, develop, and improve Med-RAS, Virtual Health for telemedicine and remotely delivered patient care, and unmanned capabilities for providing or supporting combat casualty care in far-forward and dispersed geographic environments. This research includes the design of semi-autonomous and closed-loop combat casualty triage, diagnosis, physiological monitoring, therapeutic intervention, casualty evacuation, telemedicine\/ tele-mentoring and emergency medical resupply technologies for integration with emerging multi-purpose Army Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) and Virtual Health\/Telemedicine delivery platforms while optimizing the medical logistic footprint.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), Fort Detrick, MD.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research community, as well as their associated enabling research areas."

Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for vaccine, drug, and diagnostic candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1)\tPrevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases\n(2)\tBacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3)\tViral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4)\tDiagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n\nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/ or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments."

This effort also develops prevention-based strategies and medically-based injury criteria for hearing, vestibular (sensory system supporting movement and sense of balance, located in the inner ear), and ocular\/facial protection devices; develops and evaluates neurosensory operational risk factors; develops medically based guidelines to assess neurosensory performance and models the effects of acoustic and impact trauma as stressors on vision and hearing. Efforts will investigate the medical aspects of manned unmanned teaming (MUM-T) and medical aspects of and protection against directed energy."

An objective of this program is to obtain innovative technological advancements developed in the commercial sector and integrate into the DoD technological ecosystem.\n\nIn FY 2019, the DIU scaled commercial solutions essential to military-technical advantage across the joint force.  Through predictive maintenance, DIU improved mission readiness by partnering with the Air Force to prototype predictive maintenance technology for the E-3 Sentry and C-5 Galaxy aircraft.  The prototype reduced unscheduled maintenance by 20-40% and increased readiness by 3-6%. This prototype is being scaled across the Air Force's 5,400 military aircraft and to the Army's Apache and Blackhawk helicopters. \n\nThe DIU also executed agile software development through Kessel Run, and saved taxpayer dollars by taking the Tanker Planning Tool from a white board to a digital application within four months at an initial cost of $1.5 million. The tool has saved more than $300 million and has scaled to a 300 person Air Force software development organization.  Finally, DIU increased the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) by receiving solution briefs from more than 1,200 companies based in 43 states and the District of Columbia.  DIU is working with 122 non-traditional defense contractors, 66 of which are first-time DoD vendors."

DDS requirements are driven by challenging technical problems identified by the Secretary of Defense where technology is failing the Department's mission and could impede the lethality and effectiveness of the war fighter.  These technical problems vary in scope and complexity, but at a minimum, when resolved, have a positive impact on the war fighter's mission and capabilities.  DDS involvement may be in the development of new code, product management, advising on code development processes and releases, and hacking or re-writing existing policies or processes that are antiquated or otherwise unnecessary.  DDS engages on highly troubled projects to quickly implement fixes that ultimately reduce schedule slip, increase security, lower costs, improve user experiences, and accelerate performance.    \n\nThe most pressing project in which DDS is engaged involves the vetting and security clearance process for personnel.  DDS has partnered with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency to build a prototype to improve the personnel vetting and security clearance process.  With the transfer of the background investigation mission from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to the DoD, DDS is exploring ways to deliver more accurate vetting results while eliminating the existing backlog of cases. The DDS-led System for Automated Background Evaluation and Review (SABER) prototype effort will focus on delivery of an automated investigation result, beginning with the user applying for a clearance, processing the data through government and commercial databases, recording an adjudication decision, and enrolling in continuous evaluation."

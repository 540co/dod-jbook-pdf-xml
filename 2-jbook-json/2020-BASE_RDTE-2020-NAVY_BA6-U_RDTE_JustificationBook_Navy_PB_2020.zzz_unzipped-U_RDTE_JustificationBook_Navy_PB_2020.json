The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. \n\nThe Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&E).\n\nThis project directly supports the T&E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, Low Band Transmitter, Next Generation Jammer, Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and Triton.\n\nThis project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD."

The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Force, Special Operations, and other Electronic Warfare Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for Electronic Warfare system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past ENEWS quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield\/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support Testing and Evaluation.  Simulation Display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) Testing and Evaluation and training ranges to provide visualization of Testing and Evaluation and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The Effectiveness of ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within the Department of Defense dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard Electronic Warfare systems and tactics against these type threats.  The Effectiveness of ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the Effectiveness of ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  Development Test, Operational Test and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation support includes AN\/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship InfraRed signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and Patrol Craft class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including Test and Evaluation of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' Electronic Warfare systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint Electronic Warfare exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations."

                                        "val": "The mission of the Aerial Target Systems Development program is the design and development of threat representative subsonic and supersonic aerial targets that simulate threat weapon systems, threat aircraft or threat Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA\/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets and auxiliary payloads are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment.  As to specific hardware development, this project includes:\n\n - Supersonic Targets: Portfolio includes GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST), GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST), AQM-37, and Fleet Supersonic Training Target programs. Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats. The design and development of GQM-163A capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and to a lesser degree, support fleet training. Critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events are supported for AEGIS, DDG-1000, LHA-6, CVN-78, LCS, and LSD-41\/49 (SM-6, SM-2, RAM, SSDS, and ESSM). The GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 13.0 to 66 ft. The GQM-163A has also demonstrated  higher altitude diving threat profiles. MSST was a supersonic development effort that was terminated on September 25, 2015. Once the contract termination costs have been determined by DCMA, funds may be required to cover settlement costs. However, the requirement still exists to provide a multi-stage vehicle presentation. New supersonic target development efforts include the Fleet Supersonic Training Target and a replacement target for AQM-37.\n\n - Subsonic Targets: Portfolio includes BQM-177A, and BQM-34 & BQM-74 subsonic target programs. The BQM-177A SSAT development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-74E targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities.  The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational test & evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events.  Specifically, the BQM-177A SSAT provides critical live-fire test and evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.  BQM-74s are undergoing product improvement program efforts to increase their current performance envelope to meet evolving Fleet requirements and increase operational readiness needs and other subsonic targets, such as the BQM-34, are being considered for similar efforts.   \n\n - Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), and Target Control and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TC\/TA\/AS) development: the TTSP portfolio provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial targets to provide threat representative radio frequency signatures, specifically the electronic attack and threat radar emissions (active emitters). Development of threat representative simulation components is on-going and required to keep pace with evolving threats and ensure that the Navy's threat simulation capabilities maintain warfighter readiness in the current environment. TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various TMSS projects including but not limited to: Target RF datalink hardware, ground control hardware and software, scorer transponders, scoring ground stations, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification, friend or foe transponders, and associated test sets. TA\/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide for high fidelity simulation of foreign threats. TA\/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics. TA\/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems. \n\nIn addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development.  For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach."

Target Control Systems (TCS) involve the improved command and control systems capable of controlling multiple targets simultaneously while delivering adequate fidelity of T&E telemetry data.  The TMSS program portfolio provides target control, scoring, location, and navigation of air, land and seaborne targets for fleet training and weapons systems test and evaluation.  Funding also supports the design, development and qualification of TMSS including but not limited to the current and next generation TC systems, scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification friend or foe and associated test sets.  Augmentation and auxiliary systems must be capable of augmenting targets in support of radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement\/test, radar cross section evaluation, decoy effectiveness, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare, warhead effectiveness and evaluation of fleet tactics, readiness, and training. The Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP) provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial\/surface targets to provide threat representative Radio Frequency signatures, specifically the Electronic Attack and Threat Radar Emissions (Active Emitters).  The TTSP accomplishes this by providing a collection of modules which are integrated into individual targets in various configurations to provide the ability to simulate the RF environment.  TTSP equipment in various configurations is certified for carriage in aerial\/surface targets. Funding supports the continued development of the TTSP portfolio so that the Navy can keep pace with emerging enemy threats."

These development efforts will continue to be rolled into the production baseline. Production efforts are expected to continue at higher quantities in order to meet projected MDAP T&E requirements. Additionally, development of alternative supersonic targets is being explored. \n\nCongress was notified on September 25, 2015 that the Department of the Navy made the decision to terminate the Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) development program. Termination settlement efforts are ongoing with DCMA.\n\nSubsonics: The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) program is an ACAT-IV program. The EMD contract is ongoing and a follow-on Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 3 contract will be awarded in 3rd Quarter of FY19 with Full Rate Production (FRP) Contracts to follow. Engineering Change Proposals will be contracted as required via IDIQ contract vehicles to keep pace with emerging threat systems and changes rolled into the production baseline. Development efforts for other subsonic targets will be resourced via other contracting efforts as required.\n\nTarget Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control, and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems: The acquisition strategy for these components vary, depending on industry responses to government issued Requests for Information, but most are acquired via Firm Fixed Price IDIQ contracts."

MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability."

MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability."

This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development\/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic decision support tool to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment\/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. This effort captures and maps issues\/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk."

This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower & Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions."

CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  \n\nThe program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA). The program continues analytical support for field exercises, Ad Hoc and Quick Response study requirements."

This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues\/topics appropriately performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program, serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  \n\nThe program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA). \n\nThe Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  \n\nOther evaluation processes are as follows: \nA) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nB) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance."

The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. \nOther evaluation processes: \n\nA) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. \n\nB) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO\/N8 for final review and acceptance. \n\nC) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&L).\n\nD) Navy-CNA Integration Board.  DON 3-stars and CNA leadership meet quarterly to review the annual research program, discuss priorities and related implications for current and future work, and address issues impacting CNA's ability to execute its mission as an FFRDC.  CNA research highlights are also briefed and discussed.  The board meetings are chaired by the Director, Navy Staff."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the\nSBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is\nto transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the\nSBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is\nto transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.\nPhase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of\nRecord (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the\nSBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is\nto transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.\n\nNaval War College Strategic Studies Support:  \n\nProvides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  \n\nAssessment Program: \n\nThe Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.\n\n\nOperations Integration Group:  Classified\n\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.\n\nThe Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.\n\nMTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:\n\nThis project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations through the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009, 2015, and 2016).Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD)Forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of eleven participating nations (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in multiple Projects and includes a maritime contribution to\nthe NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and\nCentral Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with \"Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations\" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.  The MTMD Forum is leveraging At-Sea Demonstration (ASD) test events and operational Fleet Exercises  to integrate technology with concepts of operations developed within MTMD Forum working groups.\n\nThe MTMD Forum develops systems and techniques that enhance protection and defense against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the development of interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. \n\nThis project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:\n\n(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps. \n(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.\n(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.\n(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.\n(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.\n(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.\n(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.\n(8) Tactical Advancement for Next Generation (TANG) to work with our Allies and International Partners using human-centered design methodologies to identify solutions to technology and sailor performance issues that have been cited during previously conducted experiments, exercises, and demonstrations.  This process will seek to leverage R&D investments and risk reduction research commercial companies are making today that can provide potential \"dual use\" technology and process solutions to complex problems.\n\n\nAnti-Tamper (AT): The AT program performs as the Navy Technical Process Owner for the Anti-Tamper systems engineering activity that is intended to prevent and\/or delay the exploitation of critical technologies in U.S. systems; manages the research, design, development, implementation, and testing of AT measures and coordinates with Department of Defense AT Executive Agent.  Starting in FY19, funding for AT is realigned to PE 0605024N Anti-Tamper Technology Support.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

                            "val": "PRJ 0149 International Coop RDT&E:\n- The increase FY2019 to FY2020 is to support requests for additional ESEP Participation from Partner and Allied Nations.  In addition, this increase continues to support the establishment of the Maritime Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare (M-TASW) effort, providing focus on TASW efforts in the Indo-Pacific region with Japan and Australia.\nPRJ 1767 Naval War Col Strategic Studies Supt:\n- Naval War Gaming Support - Increased funding from FY 2019 to FY 2020 continues resourcing of the Naval War College's expansion to execute high security war gaming and research.\nPRJ 2098 - Navy Postgraduate School (NPS) Studies Support:\n- Faculty and Student Studies, Analysis and Research - The decrease from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects fewer studies being conducted in FY 2020.\nPRJ 2221 JT Mission Assessment Studies:\n- Navy Studies & Analysis - FY 2019 to FY 2020 increase reflects inflation and need for concept studies to inform Fleet architecture and future force structure, continued development of a new model to improve the Navy's capabilities in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) mission-level analysis and increased need for modeling and simulation support for Campaign analysis and ongoing OPNAV missile defense analysis requirements.\nPRJ 3017 Enterprise Information Systems:\n- Increase in FY 2020 reflects transfer of NGEN corporate funding from 0605861N RDT&E Science and Technology Management.\nPRJ 3027 Defense Critical Infrastructure Program:\n- Mission Assurance Assessments Support - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 supports assessments concerned with strategic missions that will require follow on mitigation analysis and solution refinement, with potential for persistent cyber network evaluation at multiple sites. Funding addresses the planned assessment support of 32 sites or installations with 10 being OCONUS. Additionally, this tasking covers unplanned events like hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes that threaten DoD installations and supporting infrastructure, as well as 2-3 planned COCOM exercise events (Vigilant Shield, Ardent Sentry, and PANAMAX).\n- Cyber Mission Assurance - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects increased research on network mission assurance of defense missions and operations and enhancements of Red Team assessment capabilities. These capabilities increase the amount of time and labor required to maintain awareness of network vulnerabilities during and post-assessment to enhance the mitigations and solutions for cyber security of critical Navy and DoD networks. This persistence increases the costs associated with conducting these evaluations. The increased cost reflects the additional red team members necessary to conduct 2-3 cyber mission assurance assessments per year across DoD and NAVSEA enterprises.\nDefense Critical Electric Infrastructure - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects the increased focus on electric grid dependencies and vulnerabilities that Energy Security analysis has revealed and the efforts to increase DoD and Interagency resilience from the natural or manmade effects. 79 installations will need analysis of their critical electric power paths supported by 47 utility providers, entities needed for implementation and execution that require constant attention to ensure reliable data and analytical rigor is applied. Multiple interagency entities will be involved with both exercise (Liberty Eclipse, NERC Grid Ex, and follow on) and potential real world issues involving complex policy and technical guidance, increasing costs to the program to maintain the data from multiple industry databases.\n- Mission Assurance Program Management -  The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects the increased oversight from management efforts and utilization of centralized management tool (Innoslate) to better track programmatic requirements and subsequent related tasks, costs, and contracts.\n- Defense Critical Infrastructure - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 supports infrastructure specific asset analysis to particular DoD assets and missions, the Defense Industrial Base, and the supporting infrastructure. To provide a more overarching view of mission analysis, the increase reflects the prototype and use of models based system engineering methods and tools to enhance deliverables being asked for by senior leadership. Congressional legislative pilot studies from NDAA 1647 and 1650 related to cybersecurity of weapons platforms and critical infrastructure are due in 2020 and will need follow on analysis for the multiple weapons platforms and critical infrastructure on at least 2 prioritized sites.\n- Defense Critical Mission -  The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflect a larger number of DCMs being assessed during the period of performance. This includes 2-3 sites \/ installations every other month, necessitating an increase in assessment team members and analytical tools.\n\n\nPRJ 3312 MTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:\n- FY 2020 increase due to ramped up requirements for At-SEA demonstration for Ballistic Missile targeting.\nPRJ 3330 - Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Facilities Modernization:\n- NRL Facilities Modernization -  The increase in FY 2020 is planned for projects to replace critical equipment in the upgraded and relocated labs across NRL.\nPRJ 3363 - PACON Initiative:\n- PACOM Initiative -  Increased funding will support more advanced, critical research projects that address China Strategic Initiative Derivation knowledge gaps; further enhancement and refinement of the Critical Factors Analysis suite of analytical tools and products; dramatic increase in both the quality and quantity Emulations at the strategic and operational levels as well as expanded development for the modeling and simulation technologies that support those events; increased scope and support for the INDOPACOM Media Project that will expand to cover all Combatant Commands with added line of effort to cover unique analysis of Chinese media censorship."

                                        "val": "This exhibit has been updated to reflect the establishment of the Navy Analytic Office (NAO) which is responsible for the executive oversight of Navy studies and analysis.  The NAO was stood up to better align the annual Analytic Agenda to CNO's strategic priorities while also providing for study of the more tactical requirements of the Fleet and Navy writ large.  The outcome will be synchronized modeling, simulation, assessments, wargames, experiments and exercises providing rich, shared data to support and refine warfighting concepts and to inform budget decisions. \n \nThe Navy Assessment Program supports the Analytic Agenda by providing both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare, business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems; warfare systems, and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect warfighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  The Assessment Program provides a broad-view perspective across the Fleet and Navy staff, with an integrated look at both warfighting and warfighting-support programs.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.\n\nThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria. Concept Formulation (CONFORM)\/Concept Development and Experimentation (CDE) for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Commands (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class. Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.\nCapabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)\/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and interoperability gaps of both current and future Navy platforms and systems capabilities."

Models\/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints. \n- A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model\/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.\n- Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy.\nThe May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a CBA to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy."

Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) Forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of eleven participating nations (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in multiple Projects and includes a maritime contribution to\nthe NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with \"Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations\" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.  The MTMD Forum is leveraging At-Sea Demonstration (ASD) test events and operational Fleet Exercises  to integrate technology with concepts of operations developed within MTMD Forum working groups.\n\nThe MTMD Forum develops systems and techniques that enhance protection and defense against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the development of interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. \n\nThis project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:\n\n(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps. \n(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.\n(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.\n(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.\n(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.\n(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.\n(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.\n(8) Tactical Advancement for Next Generation (TANG) to work with our Allies and International Partners using human-centered design methodologies to identify solutions to technology and sailor performance issues that have been cited during previously conducted experiments, exercises, and demonstrations.  This process will seek to leverage R&D investments and risk reduction research commercial companies are making today that can provide potential \"dual use\" technology and process solutions to complex problems."

BMC4I evaluated Possible Point Solutions and provided recommendations for the implementation in correcting coalition interoperability gaps. BMC4I further refined information exchange requirements in preparation for at-sea demonstrations. BMC4I developed updates to MTMD Coalition Capabilities and Interoperability (CCI) and produced the Systems Tactical Data Links Interoperability Report (STIR).\n\n(2) M&S performed analysis of Target Architectures supporting improvement of information exchange requirements identified by BMC4I and the Systems Engineering Team (SET). In support of the MTMD Forum's future capability development, the M&S Working Group continued expansion and development of the M&S lab and integration of new simulation software and further development of virtualization capabilities for the test bed. In support of concept development and experimentation, M&S developed plans for testing of Target Architecture 2, as developed by BMC4I. M&S developed Mission Models to support future concepts such as Force Threat Evaluation (FTE) and Force Weapon Assignment (FWA) (FTEWA) and other Proposed Point Solutions.\n\n(3) CDEP worked with BMC4I and OR working groups to review the Coalition Capabilities and Interoperability (CCI) gaps data set and developed test plans to assess CCI gaps suitable for land-based testing. CDEP planned and conducted Annual Test Event (ATE) 2018 which was focused on Tactical Data Link (TDL) message implementation in Link-16, Link-22, Force Threat Evaluation and Weapons Assignment (FTEWA) and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5.  Laboratory constraints and the Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet) connectivity issues prevented the execution of Link-22 and IFF planned events.  CDEP rescheduled these events for ATE 2019. CDEP released the ATE 2017 Final Data Analysis Test Report which includes lessons learned from the conduct of hardware-in-the-loop tests and provides assessments and recommendations to improve information exchanges required to conduct at-sea demonstrations.\n\n(4) The Open Architecture Working Group (OAWG) began developing the Force Data Model for the Threat Evaluation (TE) Force Level Function (FLF) by analyzing the Data Requirements document and evaluating inputs from other WGs such as: Mission Threads, Target and Reference Architectures. In addition to developing use cases for TE, existing data models such as; Open Architecture Radar Interface Standard (OARIS) and Combat Resource Allocation System (CORALS) are being evaluated for inclusion in the Force Data Model. The Force Data model will be used to develop the FLF component interfaces. The OAWG will collaborate with the BMC4I, M&S, and ORWGs as well as a system experts group to ensure the Force Data model aligns with the Target and Reference Architectures as well as selected Possible Point Solutions (PPSs). Preliminary technical exchanges have also begun with M&S to ensure the Force Level Open Architecture Technical Standard (FLOATS) can be exercised in the M&S environment. The FLOATS PA amendment was signed to add Netherlands and extend the term of the project by 16 months to expire in June 2019.\n\n(5) TPEX continued preparations for MTMD participation as part of ongoing at-sea test event continuums. TPEX was vital in the planning, execution, and reporting of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) events in support of Formidable Shield 17, a SIXTH Fleet led, STRIKFORNATO-executed Fleet exercise in support of maritime IAMD live fire operations in order to build interoperability and demonstrate IAMD command and control. FS-17 was supported by MTMD Forum member nation ships from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and was executed in the beginning of FY18. TPEX will leverage events in Exercises Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 and Pacific Dragon (PD) 2018 scheduled in August of FY18. These at-sea demonstrations will include live tracking events and a combination of live and simulated IAMD engagements. RIMPAC 18\/PD 18 will be supported by MTMD Forum member nation ships from Canada, Australia, and the United States.  Planning for At-Sea Demonstrations (ASD) and follow-on at-sea testing will continue into future years and include target configuration\/procurement.  Future planning in FY18 included Formidable Shield 2019, ASD 2020, and ASD 2021.  \n\n(6) Operational Requirements Working Group will continue to provide fleet inputs and operator oversight to test and evaluation events. The Operational Concept Document will be updated along with tactics, techniques and procedures in support of ongoing at-sea demonstrations."

These demonstrations will involve simultaneous presentation of targets representing ballistic and cruise missile threats to create scenarios that represent the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) threat environment maritime forces now face when deployed. Specifically, these funds will be used to procure sounding rockets that represent the ballistic missile threat, and long lead material items: Oriole solid fuel rocket motors, thrust vane controllers (for guidance accuracy function), and system integration for all up round (AUR) buildup. The sounding rockets will be used during conduct of ASD 20 and the completed AURs are planned to be launched in FS 21. This demonstration enables maritime forces to demonstrate IAMD capability and new concepts for increased mission effectiveness, while enabling assessment of IAMD interoperability with our allies in this complex and challenging mission area. Major elements of these efforts include: ballistic target shipping and buildup, test planning and analysis, and combat system integration within the Tactical Data Link architecture that supports and enables the exercises. At the completion of each ASD event, thorough data analysis will be performed to identify interoperability issues and opportunities for the next event. Additionally, identification of systems integration, technology development and Fleet training needs, along with lessons learned, will be brought forward and implemented prior to the next ASD event. The plan is to execute an underway fleet-led event or demonstration with maritime forces at an average rate of one per year in order to increase our interoperability in the IAMD arena with our International Partners and Allies."

In FY 2017, OE conducted a beta intelligence forum and its first \"live\" intelligence forum, and is on pace to conduct an intelligence forum every two months in FY18. Currently for each two-month cycle, OE conducts an operational forum, intelligence forum, and extensive modeling and simulation using a variety of analytic tools. The first operationally-focused forum was conducted in June 2018, and the program is on track to conduct one every two months for the rest of FY 2018.\n\nOE provides operational planners and intelligence subject matter experts (SMEs) with highly structured and repeatable processes with which to develop, test, and refine concepts. OE now includes separate, but interrelated, operational and intelligence-focused events utilizing highly-qualified SMEs to provide qualitative analysis, and robust modeling and simulation for quantitative analysis. The OE program is maturing through extensive participation by operational planners and intelligence SMEs, and continues to yield significant insights that fundamentally influence the development of operational plans.\n\n\nOperational Decision Analysis (ODA). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on ODA sub Line of Effort support effort with at least 80% of initial objectives being achieved by 3QTR FY 2018.\n\nODA provides funding to support continuing requirement for studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). The PE directly support CSIs Strategic Emulation LOE and will provide critical technical inputs and strategic insights that complement the programs OE output database, which is still under development. ODA outputs will significantly enhance Combatant Component Command staffs with their operational and intelligence planning and global synchronization across multiple domains amongst all geographic and functional combatant commands.  \n\nDecision Support Elements to Operational Emulation Modeling and Simulation (DSEOMS). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on this major LOE with at least 80% of initial objectives being met by 3QTR FY 2019.\n\nDSEOMS provides funding to support all four major LOEs for the CSI program and all its sub-LOEs. This effort will provide a comprehensive and campaign-quality decision support toolset to decision makers across the entire CSI enterprise: OSD, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Intelligence Community, and the Whole of US Government (Interagency). This PE will create a set of enhanced automated and doctrinal decision- making tools to assist key policy- and strategic leaders on a full spectrum of contingencies related to competitor nations. DSEOMS will provide analytic modeling and simulation tools that take inputs from all major CSI program LOEs; the goal being to present decision- and policy-makers and their planning staffs with a rich dataset of information that is relevant, timely, and substantive for their respective problem sets. The current scope and focus across all LOEs is to support emerging near-term and longer-term planning to both significantly enhance war planning orientation and force posture considerations but also to significantly enhance more informed strategic choices regarding future joint\/service capability investments and joint\/service operational concepts across all strategic domains.   Ultimately, fully integrated program deliverables will guide a deliberative process for identifying efficiencies in major service platform decisions to ensure they are optimized for the full-spectrum of projected adversary capabilities in the future."

FY 2020 funding increase of $1.33M from PB 2019 to PB 2020 is to support the accomplishment of this routine maintenance.  Without the increase in funding, the Self Defense Test Ship risks being placed in Do Not Operate status, which will negatively impact the Navy's ability to conduct realistic live fire testing in support of CVN 78, Littoral Combat Ship and LSD 52 Class Amphibious Ship Self Defense Systems. \n\nProject 3206 - $1.2M FY 2020 TOA decrease from PB 2019 to PB 2020 is due to Underexecution Issue of $1.0M and realignment of $200k from PU 3206 to PU 3238 Threat Engineering. \n\nProject 0569: The funding decrease of approximately $7.0 million reflects a reduction in planned depot events for NAVAIR RDT&E aircraft - primarily driven by DON decisions to retire legacy FA-18 aircraft, and the grounding of NAVAIR C-130's due to propeller issues, resulting in delay of those depot inductions.\n\nProject 3238: Project was established to support the Acquisition Threat Evaluation Projects (ATEP). Funding was realigned within the PE from project 3206 T&E Enterprise. \n\nThe FY 2020 request was reduced by $2.5 million to reflect the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nSchedule: Not applicable."

Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Aircraft Structure Periodic Adjustments (ASPA), Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, Aviation Climate Assessment Survey System (ACASS) and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&E requirements.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead\/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN\/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.\n\nEnterprise Cost elements:\n\na) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nb) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LSD 52, DDG 1000, LCS and CVN 78.\n\nc) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LSD 50, LCS and CVN 78.\n\nd) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).\n\ne) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.\n\nf) Maintenance of Combat System (CS) includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nThe T&E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&S) data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test."

This program also produces critical, valid T&E assets that satisfy Commander Operational Test & Evaluation Force (COTF) and Director of Operational Test and Evaluation  (DOT&E) requirements as these same tools will be used to support and supplement test and evaluation and training against the assessed threats in both testbed and at-sea configurations, ensuring consistency between the development and T&E acquisition phases.  \n\nATEP is the surface navy cost effective, affordable, single, common threat modeling architecture that supports its Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), (and other subordinate programs) RDT&E activities throughout the acquisition life cycle and extending through operations and sustainment. ATEP satisfies Life Cycle Mission Planning (LCMP) requirements by providing the threat modeling architecture needs to support systems engineering trade-off analysis, T&E (DT and OT) and operations and sustainment (OA) through testbed evaluation activities.  ATEP is a critical component in ensuring requirements are achievable, affordable and testable.\n\nATEP provides the required threat models to ensure fleet operational readiness against the threat. Specifically, ATEP Satisfies Operational Test (OT) and Operational Assessment (OA) requirements including COMOPTEVFOR requirement (COMOPTEVFOR Memo, 3960, SER 00\/244 of 29 April 2016).  This requirement specifies ATEP is necessary to provide the surface navy validated Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat models for use in the M&S infrastructure supporting OT&E.  Moreover, ATEP satisfies COMOPTEVFOR requirement that threat models must be at a fidelity commensurate with the blue-force system representations and contain intel-derived lethality\/vulnerability data, physics-based six degrees-of-freedom models, reactive seekers and guidance, and other engineering data.  ATEP is necessary to evaluate mandatory Key Performance Parameters including operational effectiveness, and suitability to include a systems lethality and survivability, and achieving its performance requirements within operation and sustainment costs.\n\nATEP provides the threat models necessary to ensure the surface navy 1.) Avoids Technological Surprise and 2.) Eliminates Point Solutions. ATEP satisfies necessary Threat model requirements to conduct warfare systems analysis of alternatives including gaps analysis, and threat systems mission and performance analysis and effectiveness studies supporting both material and non-material solutions while supporting the development of Intelligence Community Tasking Threat. \n\nWith Threat Engineering efforts and development of ATEPs the Navy and PEO IWS will produce substantiated risk and cost based Fleet Level Engineering decisions producing predictable and timely fleet capability against stressing threats. Scalable warfighting performance will be evaluated against the appropriate threat environment, using sufficient, verified and validated models applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis. \n\nWithout Threat Engineering efforts and ATEPs the Navy and the PEO will incur unsubstantiated risk and cost in developing capability for the fleet. Scalable warfighting performance will not be evaluated against the threat environment, sufficient models will not be developed or applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis."

The program also provides marine vessels overhauls and preventative maintenance in support of the 23 Major Range and Test Facility Base marine vessels located at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, Pacific Missile Range Facility, Honolulu, HI, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport Nanoose and Dabob Bay Ranges, Keyport, WA, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD, and Naval Undersea Warfare Center Detachment Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center.  The Test and Evaluation activities make up the Navy portion of the Department of Defense's Major Range and Test Facility Base. These activities are chartered to perform Test and Evaluation for the development and acquisition of technology advanced weapons systems. Core Test and Evaluation capabilities and capacity are operated to obtain weapons system performance documentation for acquisition program milestone decisions to provide operational forces with effective weapons systems. This program provides Navy Acquisition Program Managers required test capabilities; lowers cost of Test and Evaluation; removes cost and scheduling impact of providing their own Test and Evaluation resources; and retains the physical airspace, land space and sea space needed to conduct testing."

These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and Test and Evaluation  aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its Test and Evaluation mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range, which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.  This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers."

These vessels are used to launch and recover torpedoes, acoustic systems, and other weapons, provide range surveillance and clearance, and can be configured as a target.  Overhauls are required to operate ships over 300 tons overseas in compliance with American Bureau of Shipping \"Load Line\" certification requirements.  Major preventative maintenance requiring shipyard support is also performed during these periods to mitigate risks of failures."

DoD mandated an increase in Cyber Security testing due to an increase in cyber intrusions from adversaries.  Cyber intrusions continue to challenge our weapon systems' ability to detect threats, react to threats, and restore system functionality after a cyber-attack.  Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets, and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.\n\nThe FY 2019 to FY 2020 funding increase also supports the Network Modernization effort.  Part of this modernization will strengthen COMOPTEVFOR's presence on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and enhance collaboration, access and data flow to stakeholders operating on NMCI. COMOPTEVOR legacy unclassified and classified networks prevent collaboration, sharing, and access to operational test tools, test results, and data with Commands that work for COMOPTEVOR while executing operational testing (VX-1, VX-9, VMX-1, HMX-1), organizations that use operational test products (SYSCOMs, PEO\/PMs, Fleet Shore Commands), and VCNO, OPNAV Resource Sponsors, and ASN\/RDA.  \n\n\n\n\nTechnical: N\/A\n\nSchedule: N\/A"

This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness, suitability, and cyber survivability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop \"minimum, adequate\" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT Network, database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources."

Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets, and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.\n\nThe FY 2019 to FY 2020 funding increase also supports the Network Modernization effort.  Part of this modernization will strengthen COMOPTEVFOR's presence on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and enhance collaboration, access and data flow to stakeholders operating on NMCI.

The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&S costs for day to day operations of the staff\/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&S costs typical of military field commands\/activities). Within this project, over 1\/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead\/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV\/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned\/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&E offices\/activities, and miscellaneous other customers\/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint\/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            \n                              \nNumber of Tests Conducted - FY 2018 = 110; FY 2019 = 112; FY 2020 = 114\nNumber of Programs Supported - FY 2018 = 424; FY 2019 = 427; FY 2020 = 430"

This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. \n\n(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar\/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations. It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems, as well as for the Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessments.\n\n(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.\n\n(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system\/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.\n\n(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program (RTSO). The program researches the Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental Effects (E3)between shipboard transmitters and receivers on ships and the interactions of the EM systems within the other systems installed on units within a strike group.  The program will develop a capability to monitor the EM Spectrum Usage on a ship and be able to validate the spectrum plan to ensure Electromagnetic Capability (EMC) is achieved within the strike group.  The program will develop a capability to display compliance with the spectrum plan in a Common Operational Picture (COP) display.  These initial capabilities of Own Force Monitoring provide Battlespace Awareness and will be instrumental in enabling Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare.  These capabilities of self-awareness will further enhance the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain. \n\nAt the direction of OPNAV, in the beginning of FY2018 the project changed the technical approach to mitigate cost, schedule, and performance risks associated with the original Hardware (H\/W) solution that required extensive\nintegration and networking of all spectrum dependent systems.  The revised technical approach simplifies the original hardware plan required in favor of a centralized radio frequency monitoring capability with software applications that can still meet fleet requirements of own force monitoring.  This has resulted in near term schedule delay that is recoverable in FY19."

The program will develop a capability to monitor the EM Spectrum Usage on navy platforms and be able to validate the spectrum plan to ensure Electromagnetic Capability (EMC) is achieved within the strike group. The program will develop a capability to display compliance with the spectrum plan in a Common Operational Picture (COP) display. These initial capabilities of Own Force Monitoring provide Battlespace Awareness and will be instrumental in enabling Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW). These capabilities of self-awareness will further enhance the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain."

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n\nMarine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations."

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research & Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items."

The wargaming capability facilitates the assessment and evaluation of operating and functional concepts, operational and technology-based approaches, current concepts of operations, and principles and methods that inform decisions in support of force development and requirements generation.  Wargaming capability results are used to develop, assess, and refine future operating and functional concepts across the full range of military operations (ROMO).  Additionally, they test current OPLANS and CONOPS; examine operational and tactical actions through repeated, multiple iterations; enable the full development of concepts through opportunities for examination and evaluation; assess capability investments while guiding capability resourcing actions and informing the POM development; and provide education and leadership development."

Given the complexity and the speed of changes in the IE and to address the significant role information now plays in current and future conflicts, a unifying operational and technical strategy must be developed to outpace our adversaries.\nAnalysis will inform the development and integration of Marine Corps Information Environment Operations (IE Ops) that are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan, Marine Corps Operating Concepts (MOC).  Research and analysis efforts support: design and coordinated implementation of an Objective Network to fight on and through a contested environment; design and collaboration on a Naval Tactical Grid and a Joint Tactical Grid; a threat estimate to inform capability development; and analysis to inform the development and fielding of an integrated information capability.  These efforts will be accomplished leveraging analytic support from government Labs and Industry to dynamically exploit our National Defense Strategy (NDS) priority operational problems related to the Information Environment through limited user evaluations and functional capability assessments with Marines. In addition, rapid development of capabilities to address problems in the IE Ops will be developed utilizing the Accelerator process which utilizes best commercial practice of design thinking."

The objective of this project is carried out by multiple tasks that ensure development and delivery of naval Information Warfare (IW) capabilities that are well-integrated, interoperable, secure, and resilient to meet validated warfighting requirements.  \n\nThe Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Architecture 2147:\nThis project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR POR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture.\n\nFleet Experimentation 3319:  \nThe U.S. Navy's Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) project advances\/augments operational and tactical warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The main focus of FLEX between 2018 and 2024 is to operationalize \"A Design For Maintaining Maritime Superiority\" Blue Line of Effort (LOE) through the execution of Fleet Design materiel\/non-materiel capability employment.  \n\nTrident Warrior Project 3320: \nThe U.S. Navy's Trident Warrior (TW) experimentation campaign enables early delivery of capabilities to the warfighter via Fleet-directed Trident Warrior operational events with an emphasis on United States Fleet Forces\/Commander Pacific Fleet (USFF\/CPF) directed focus areas. \n  \nMaritime Communications Demonstration Project 3420:\nClassified Project Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) is not a new start.  Funding was realigned from project 3319 FLEX in FY18. The Expeditionary SFOC Communications is developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both materiel and non-materiel methodologies to provide resilient command and control within the maritime domain.

The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACME program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy (USN) expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Mission Partner Environment\/ Future Mission Networking (MPE\/FMN), the U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System - eXtended (BICES-X), and with the Joint Information Environment (JIE).\nCurrently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied\/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Denied, Degraded, Intermittent and Low-bandwidth (DDIL) operations, and to counter Anti-Access Area Denial (A2\/AD) threats. Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich IW data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA\/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, to include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities as well as Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in secure data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements."

These efforts enable a standardized approach to move out faster to improve the Navy's cyber resiliency. \n\n(2) Provide the cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability which supports cybersecurity test requirements and the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) components of USS Secure. USS Secure is a cyber assessment program within the Navy. This System of Systems (SoS) (Afloat, Aloft, C4I & Shore) capability in a test laboratory environment provides a rapidly re-configurable capability that integrates maritime hardware systems into a virtual platform. This platform level SoS provides cybersecurity research, development, test and evaluation, and training, not otherwise possible. This combination of Systems Commands (SYSCOM) laboratories, cyber ranges, and Red Teams simulating Navy platforms in operational maritime environments is critical for effectively evaluating cyber threats against specified mission threads.\n\n(3) Define an integrated Enterprise Architecture to support design, development and delivery of integrated Navy Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System capabilities. This architecture reflects current (as-is) and future (target) end states to support technical analyses, program planning, and enterprise-level investment decisions across IW capabilities. Perform mission based system of systems analysis to ensure integration and interoperability, and validate end-to-end warfighting capabilities to quickly address emerging threats. \n\n(4) Provides engineering tools and processes to drive rigorous Systems Engineering discipline across the acquisition lifecycle to support rapid development and delivery of secure and interoperable C4ISR, Business IT, and Space Systems capabilities that meet Fleet requirements. Conduct Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) to provide independent, objective assessments of technical maturity and compliance with applicable architectures, specifications and standards across IW capabilities. \n\n(5) The Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX) provides a means to demonstrate and evaluate the interoperability of United States (US), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and coalition information sharing systems.\n\n(6) Navy Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology aligns to CNO priorities to deliver revolutionary capabilities to improve fleet readiness.  These enterprise solutions will provide the foundation to (1) enhance warfighter capability through new innovative system designs; (2) increase readiness through low volume production of hard to source items; and (3) improve warfighting capacity by enabling production at or near the point of need. Specific efforts include the development of an Enterprise Digital Manufacturing Architecture which addresses design and certification of AM capabilities for both afloat and ashore, development of Cyber Security Risk Management Profiles for devices and applications on operational networks, definition of a secure Technical Data Package to describe components that can be digitally manufactured, and the development of an overarching, enterprise-level Digital Manufacturing Thread (device management, digital rights management, licensing, configuration management, data storage rule\/access and application programing interfaces)."

They also serve as a means to influence and drive Programs of Record (PoR) toward a common, more efficient state that promotes interoperability and security.\n\nThe Naval Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Reference Architecture project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment and Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment and Space & Naval Warfare Systems Command-wide Enterprise Architecture policies. This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR PoR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture. These efforts will reduce Information Technology\/ISR infrastructure complexity and variances, making it easier to manage, operate and defend our ISR capabilities, and help inform investment decisions across the Navy's ISR enterprise to support Assured Command and Control, Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires.\n\nThis effort will encompass the documentation and analysis of current ISR enterprise architectures to inform and guide requirements for target architecture development and performance requirements to support full use and incorporation of ISR capabilities to advance Navy operations afloat. The associated studies will produce both technical and non-technical implementation guidance across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities spectrum."

Additionally, the Navy's FLEX program addresses innovative concepts, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps. Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war simulations, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Naval-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&T), academia, and industry partners."

Experimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities.  The FLEX Execution Plan supported the following events: \n\nELECTROMAGNETIC MANEUVER WARFARE (EMW) EXPERIMENTATION\nNavy conducted multiple events designed to synchronize and align experiment initiatives with EMW campaign tasks to provide solutions to EMW capability gaps and to ensure development of doctrine is synchronized with the introduction of new technology in order to provide the Fleet and Fleet trainers with required capabilities at the tactical and operational levels. Specific events completed in FY18 include:\n\nRIMPAC 18 AT-SEA EXPERIMENT - This event, leveraged the fleet assets and at-sea time associated with a major Pacific fleet training exercise, Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018. The effort evaluated technology and\/or TTP-related initiatives to close warfighting gaps identified across multiple POM-20 Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCLs).\n\nSPECTRAL TSUNAMI 2018 SEMINAR WAR SIMULATION - This event, held 09-13 July 2018 and sponsored by OPNAV N2N6, was comprised of stakeholders from across the Navy to define the baseline warfighting scenario and existing technical capabilities to form an Integrated Technical Capabilities Baseline (ITCB). The war simulation identified areas of strengths and weaknesses, areas for improving operational effectiveness and hardware\/software changes necessary to improve existing POR systems or suggest requirements for new capability. The war simulation built upon the results of the 2017 war simulation and the scope was expanded to include select coalition capabilities and participants.\n\nNAVY TACTICAL GRID ENABLERS 2018 AT-SEA EXPERIMENT - This continued effort to operationalize the Navy Tactical Grid leveraged STORMFORCE 2018, a National Security Agency (NSA)-sponsored Five Eyes tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT) interoperability-focused experiment from 07-11 May 2018 to examine and enhance integration and interoperability of sensors, networks, data fusion, and analytic capabilities across national, theater, and organic platforms. The effort also involved an MQ-4C Triton Workshop completed 22-24 May 2018 that examined concepts of operation and employment of the Triton unmanned air system in preparation for an early operational deployment in late 2018. The final phase of this effort occurred during exercise VALIANT SHIELD 2018 from 11-23 September 2018.\n\nSTRIKE GROUP-ORGANIC, LONG ENDURANCE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) experiment (now referred to as the Maritime - Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAS Workshop) - This effort, held 24-27 July 2018, examined the employment of long endurance UAVs organic to a Carrier or Expeditionary Strike Group - a capability that will provide unit level ships with the ability to transport intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike payloads long distances from the host platform.\n\nOFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH (ONR) TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION GAMES (TIGS)- This series of workshops executed in conjunction with ONR gave Fleet operators the opportunity to examine emerging capabilities and determine potential concepts of employment to effectively incorporate innovative capabilities into Fleet warfighting missions and tasks.  Technologies examined include: High Power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS); Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel (MDUSV) Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Concept of Employment; and Unmanned System Super Swarms.\n\nASSURED COMMAND AND CONTROL (AC2) PROTOTYPE AT SEA EXPERIMENT - This effort, held in September 2018, leveraged fleet assets and at-sea time to conduct an extended evaluation of an emerging technology in support of EMW objectives.\n\nMARITIME CYBERSPACE EXPERIMENT - This classified effort built upon prior year experiments to further examine U.S. Navy vulnerabilities to adversary cyber threats.\n\nCOUNTER-UNMANNED SYSTEMS (C-UXS) EXPERIMENT SERIES - This effort built upon the 2017 counter-UAV experiment by examining emerging TTPs and technologies to counter the proliferation of unmanned undersea, surface, and air vehicles. The series involved three distinct efforts: the observation of at-sea testing of non-kinetic counter-UAS technologies from October - December 2017; a counter small UAS (C-sUAS) TTP workshop from 13-16 February 2018, and the Black Dart Maritime at-sea experiment of several kinetic and non-kinetic C-UxS capabilities from 04-08 June 2018. Black Dart Maritime also included a demonstration of ONR's unmanned system \"super swarm\" capability.\n\nNAVAL FORCE INTEGRATION EXPERIMENTATION\nNaval Force Integration experimentation in 2018 examined integration and interoperability issues associated with coordinated USN-USMC operations. The primary goal was to reexamine Navy and Marine Corps organizational and command relationships in order to enable effective Naval operations across the maritime domain. Specific events completed in FY18 include:\n\nNAVAL INTEGRATION IN SUPPORT OF DISTRIBUTED MARITIME OPERATIONS (NI-DMO) War Simulation - Originally called Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE), this USFF and MARFORCOM sponsored war simulation, completed 05-09 February 2018, focused on operational level objectives and examined how a Fleet Commander task organizes to achieve sea control in complex, contested environments.\n\nMINE WARFARE (MIW) EXPERIMENTATION\nThrough workshops, war simulation and at-sea events, the FY 18 efforts continued to examine TTP and Command and Control (C2) construct for the future Mine Counter Measure (MCM) force as new programs of record and unmanned systems come on line, and legacy systems begin to decommission. Specific events completed in FY18 include:\n\nCOMSIXTHFLT MCM WORKSHOP - This effort, completed 27 February - 02 March 2018, examined current and planned Navy MCM equipment (manned and unmanned) and evaluated concepts of employment with an overall goal of developing a product that merges overall Fleet requirements.\n\nOPERATIONAL LEVEL OF WAR\/TACTICAL LEVEL OF WAR (OLW\/TLW) INTEGRATION EXPERIMENTATION\nAnother CUSFF\/CPF designated focus area for experimentation in 2018, OLW\/TLW Integration experiments examined current and emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and current and emerging technologies with a goal of identifying innovative solutions that will support the capstone naval concept of a Fleet Design based on integration, distribution, and maneuver. Specific events completed in FY18 include:\n\nNAVY INTEGRATED FIRES ELEMENT (NIFE) Workshop - This June 2018 effort examined and refined a draft NIFE Tactical Memorandum (TACMEMO) to facilitate transition of TTP to formal doctrine and development of training requirements at the OLW and TLW in support of enhanced maritime targeting capabilities.\n\nSPACE EXPERIMENTATION SERIES - This effort built upon the findings and recommendations of the 2017 Space war simulation in order to further explore the optimization of space-based capabilities in support of the maritime environment.

The focus is to demonstrate capabilities leveraging existing DOD investments and infrastructure to move data and information. Demonstration will include maritime assets, experimental methodologies, and current backhaul architecture for data movement. Solutions will address technologies across the Radio Frequency (RF) and Optical spectrum using SFOC communications systems. The key deliverable will be a series of at sea demonstrations to validate maritime segment components in an operationally representative environment.  This is not a new start.  In FY17 $2.8M of funding was managed from within the Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program and used for MCD project tasking for transparency. This effort is part of Secretary of Defense's (SECDEF) third offset initiative and was identified as a required operational capability by USEUCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USSTRATCOM. This effort will fund limited technical development and a series of at-sea demonstrations raising the technical readiness levels of various components with a cable handling and deployment system in an operationally representative environment, with the intent to rapidly transition to an operational capability."

This will be accomplished through protection, detection, response, restoration, remediation, and mitigation. Testing and evaluation will be completed at Marine Corps facilities and Government Labs, to include the Marine Corps Cyber Range, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA).\n\nSec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. \n\nSec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. \n\nSec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Assessments will end in 2020 with the submission of the final report. Strategies mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation."

Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize DoE and DoD national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress.

Supporting these vulnerability assessments will be the identification and development of mission modeling artifacts outlining the relationship between those identified facility related control systems and the relevant DoD and Navy mission and operational plans.

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

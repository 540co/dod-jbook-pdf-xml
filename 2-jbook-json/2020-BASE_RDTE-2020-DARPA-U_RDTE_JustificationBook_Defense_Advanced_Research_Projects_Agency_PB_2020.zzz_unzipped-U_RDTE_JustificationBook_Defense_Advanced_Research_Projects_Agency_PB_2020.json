                        "val": "The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences.\n\nThe Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security requirements.  Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk.  This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation.  The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national security and homeland defense.\n\nThe Cyber Sciences project supports long-term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security.  Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk.  The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project will produce breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.\n\nThe Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing.  In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.\n\nThe Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.\n\nThe Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems.\n\nThe Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging\/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security.  Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health, as well as create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self-healing materials)."

However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD.  Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context.  The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges:  (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; and (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models.  This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at city scale and will significantly improve DoD ability to assess intent, deception, and other social behaviors."

The SD2 program will collect raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, develop computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and create data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design.

The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and national security issues.  The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers and the user community.  Current activities include research in fifteen topic areas spanning from Machine Learning and Many Body Physics, to Wideband Transmitter-Antenna Interfaces and Multi-Scale Models of Infectious Disease Dynamics.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs."

One focus area of this thrust is developing a unified mathematical framework to enable better visualization and analysis of massive, complex data sets.  Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities.  Other work in this thrust focuses on developing the mathematical and computational tools required to generate and better manage the enormous complexity of design, ultimately allowing designers to more easily discover non-intuitive (yet realizable) designs that fully leverage new materials and advanced manufacturing approaches now available.  Outcomes from this thrust will improve the speed and accuracy of modeling and simulation, as well as enable management of complexity across DoD devices, parts and systems. Another focus area of this thrust is multi-physics models for predicting behavior and non-intuitive failure pathways for complex, dynamic physical systems."

Since the very beginning of the field, artificial intelligence has sought to create machines that can use language, interact naturally with humans, and form abstractions and concepts.  Human language is inherently ambiguous, so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and shared context to communicate efficiently.  CWC will provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world, encode the physical world in a perceptual structure, and link language to this perceptual encoding.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding, which are essential for human communication.  CWC will also extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts and virtual constructs.  These CWC advances in foundational areas of artificial intelligence will contribute to future military capabilities in robotics and command and control."

Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continued operation.  BRASS will create tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes."

While such deception attacks against ML have become sophisticated and varied, the development of defensive capabilities for ML systems has not been maintained.

In supervised ML, the system learns by example to recognize things, such as objects in images or speech.  Humans provide these examples to ML systems during their training in the form of labeled data.  With enough labeled data on which to train ML systems, it is generally possible to build useful models, but training accurate models currently requires large amounts of labeled data that can be costly to obtain.  LwLL will address this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation.  LwLL-based ML systems will be easier to train and use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments."

For example, simulation of complex nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence, fluid flow and plasma dynamics can be challenging even using currently available high power computing resources.

To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities would impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data in real-time, often have limited data sets for training, and must be deployed in environments where unpredictable events may occur.

To demonstrate the applicability of Knowledge Representation technology to multiple complex systems, the thrust included validation across multiple disparate scientific and engineering fields.  The technology developed under this thrust will revolutionize the process of scientific discovery by efficiently maximizing the potential of large, heterogeneous, multi-scale datasets across numerous complex scientific fields."

At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which could include cryptographic private keys, special inputs\/failsafe modes, and proprietary algorithms.  Today's state-of-the-art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.) that is not resilient against automated tools.  Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970s.  In its present form, cryptographic obfuscation incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical.  The SafeWare program took this very early-stage obfuscation theory and increased its practicality and efficiency."

In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.\n\nWithin this project, Beyond Scaling programs will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling).  Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems.  Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon.  Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory.  Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Beyond Scaling programs move to Project ES-02, Beyond Scaling Sciences, in FY 2019."

This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function.  Reducing the Size, Weight, And Power (SWaP) of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials and provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals.  For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.  The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems."

For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal.  This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide.  Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF.  This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size.  AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system.  This new capability would enable a range of applications including hard-to-jam wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.  Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels."

These sugar cubed-sized microrobots could obtain local sensing data to assist with location of injured persons or critical infrastructure failures.  The capabilities of the developed microrobots will be tested through a series of Olympic-themed events at the end of the program.  The primary technical developments needed are in the efficiency, robustness, and control of millimeter-scale actuators, which allow the robots to move using new materials, processing, and sensor integration techniques, and in the power and energy capacity of batteries, which provide the power required for the microrobot to move and sense stimuli.  Complete platforms will require access controls for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).  Successful execution of the SHRIMP program will advance the micro-robotics field, allowing for practical robots to assist in disaster relief efforts in environments for which traditional robotics cannot efficiently operate due to their larger size.

A-PhI will demonstrate that a compact photonic integrated chip can replace the optical assembly for trapped atomic gyroscopes and clocks without degrading the performance of the device.  PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.  While PNT needs are usually met by using the Global Positioning System, GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential.  Currently, in the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical\/navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units can provide GPS-like accuracy for the short term.  However, longer-term GPS independent strategies are still desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable PNT accuracy better than GPS for short durations."

HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  HAVOC will fund basic research in vacuum electronics to improve understanding of the various phenomena governing vacuum electronic amplifiers operating at mm-wave frequencies above 75 GHz.  Focus areas will include modeling and simulation techniques, advanced manufacturing methods, novel beam-wave interaction structures, high current density and long-life cathodes, and other relevant topics.

When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Applied research efforts are funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15."

Today, electronic components are limited in their ability to distinguish between two or more signals operating at the same frequency when one signal is strong enough to jam the others.  The jamming signal, in this case, saturates the receiver electronics much like loud music drowns out a quiet conversation.  By using advancements in new semiconductor materials, processing, and novel signal interaction mechanisms, SPAR components will be able to pick out friendly RF signals from both intentional and unintentional jamming signals, even when those signals sit on top of one another in frequency.  This capability would enable a range of new applications including communications in contested battlefield RF environments, jamming the RF spectrum while maintaining communication, and full-duplex radio communication.  Other potential applications include equipping mobile radios with SPAR-enabled front ends for simultaneous jam-resistant two-way communication and electronic warfare."

Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials.

To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities would impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data in real-time, often have limited data sets for training, and must be deployed in environments where unpredictable events may occur.

JUMP will therefore sponsor academic research teams focused on related key technology areas that will impact future DoD capabilities and national security.  The JUMP program will not only push fundamental technology research but also establish long-range microelectronic research themes with greater emphasis on end-application and systems-level computation.  By discovering the science underlying new technologies and overcoming engineering challenges, JUMP will enable DoD applications to exploit the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio frequency (RF) to terahertz (THz) and to employ both distributed and centralized computing with embedded intelligence and memory.

Specific approaches include non-traditional synthetic approaches such as the use of extreme pressure and\/or temperature conditions, engineering and controlling atomic-scale processing routes for designer microstructures, and the synthesis and rapid screening of many molecules to more quickly identify those with desired functions and\/or properties.  Efforts in this thrust also include assembly of these and other materials, such as subwavelength engineered shapes, into micro-to-macro-scale objects and devices, exploration of molecules for information storage and processing, and fundamental studies of the properties and function of these molecular ensembles and systems."

This program will investigate approaches for identifying pathogens based on specific behaviors, or phenotypes, such as niche finding or cell toxicity.  Unlike current methods, which rely on a priori knowledge of the pathogen and cannot detect or otherwise analyze unknown threats, this approach will handle scenarios involving engineered or undiscovered bacterial pathogens that do not have known hallmarks.  Advances in this area will produce a completely new capability to assess the emergence of pathogens and to detect pathogens that have been specifically engineered to evade detection by traditional methods.  Resulting systems may be used to alert deployed military personnel operating around the world to new biothreats, or in response to a U.S.-based discovery, outbreak, or pandemic."

This program will develop approaches that combine high-resolution biosensors to track the healing process in real-time with bioactuators to stimulate restoration where and when needed.  The primary challenge to achieving this is the lack of a closed-loop interface that can manipulate highly complex signaling pathways in wounds and the developmental interdependencies that scale from cell to tissue.  The program will develop new methods to convert dense multi-modal information into the body's native repair processes, and will leverage artificial intelligence to guide the delivery of the signals necessary for healing.  Advances from this program will produce bioactuators that can release diverse stimuli with high spatial and temporal resolution, and biosensors that provide the requisite in situ measurement to guide the healing process."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale and adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries developed the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries provided game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.\n\nLiving Foundries developed tools to simplify, abstract, and standardize the biological production pathway optimization process.  Additionally, Living Foundries identified the fundamental design rules that govern the construction and organization of underlying genetic elements in the production pathways.  Research thrusts included development of the fundamental tools, capabilities, and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  This resulted in rapid design, construction, implementation, and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality.

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to health monitoring and preventing the spread of infectious disease.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling, and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  To enable in-theater, continuous analysis and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including the use of bacterial predators as therapeutics against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; developing techniques to enable rapid transient immunity for emerging pathogens; exploring methods to slow damage from pathological infection or traumatic injury; and leveraging fundamental biological mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Advances in this area may be used as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease."

Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance.  Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness.  The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust will investigate fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants.  Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a National Security risk as a potential pandemic."

Research will focus on the integration of novel bioinformatics approaches, high-content physiological model systems, and new bio-orthogonal chemical synthesis methods to treat the system in order to achieve desired physiological effects. Progress in this area will lead to new pharmacological discovery and design principles that will lead to products that can be used to augment physical fitness training and maintenance for military populations.

Research efforts in this area will apply recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness.  One approach to achieve this goal is identifying the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species may be combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival.  By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, one may formulate a survival blueprint to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection.  This approach is orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention.  Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens."

Successful battlefield medical and neural interface technologies developed within this Program Element address a broad range of DoD challenges to ensure warfighter readiness, including both resilience to infectious disease and neurotechnology for improved warfighter performance.  To maintain warfighter health, battlefield medical technologies research in this project will investigate disease forecasting, detection, and therapeutic response.  Example programs include a predictive platform for forecasting disease outbreak, identification of early infection biomarkers to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater, new methods to rapidly develop medical countermeasures in response to an emerging biothreat, and in-theater manufacturing capabilities for field-relevant pharmaceuticals to reduce the logistical burden and infrastructure requirements.  To improve warfighter performance, this project will develop new neural architectures and data processing algorithms to interface the nervous system with multiple devices, enabling control of robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  Additionally, advanced evidence-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)."

Military personnel with amputated limbs get limited benefit from recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the user interface for controlling the limb is low-performance and unreliable.  Through investments in the DARPA Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, novel interface systems have been developed that overcome these issues and are designed to last for the lifetime of the patient.  The goal of the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception & Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program is to create the first bi-directional (motor & sensory) peripheral nerve implant for controlling and sensing advanced prosthetic limb systems.  With a strong focus on transition, the HAPTIX program will create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss.  Research in this area will also address similar interface technologies with other nerve pathways such as the spinal cord.  The anticipated transition partner is the Army."

One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program examine the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this program include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression."

While new technology platforms have enhanced our ability to respond to illness and disease, there is a need for predictive and pre-emptive technologies that enable us to correctly prepare a response prior to its obvious need, such as in a barracks or in a confined environment (e.g., submarine).  Research in this program will investigate new methods for the collection and detection of multiplexed biological markers as well as the analysis, correlation, and ultimate integration of vast personalized data into the clinical care information technology infrastructure.  Additionally, this program will develop new approaches to integrate multi-source data streams to create effective predictive models of disease outbreak and spread.  Technologies developed in this program will enable clinically actionable information, even when an individual has no awareness of symptoms, and extend infectious disease forecasting into a real-time, accurate capability for decision support."

Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.  The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems.  Advances in these areas could allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations.  Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, should help develop new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications."

SC2 will address the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access.  Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack.  First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized.  Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack.  SC2 will address this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time.  In particular, SC2 participants will be challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies.  SC2 will conduct two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years.  The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum."

The performance of future RF systems in the DoD will be defined by their ability to adapt and respond to their environment in real-time. We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required. RFMLS technology will develop machine learning techniques that are able to help manage this complexity by, for example, recognizing specific emitters or detecting anomalies in a cluttered environment. The objective of the RFMLS program is to both develop these foundational technologies and to apply them to relevant DoD systems."

Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in computational efficiency to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlespace in real time.  The HIVE program moves to PE 0602716E\/ Project ELT-02 in FY 2019."

For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit would require detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack would require summary data from a great many devices.

At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers, which brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing.  The Dispersed Computing program will develop a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources.  A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements.  These dual-purposed network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks\/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data given network conditions and available network-compute elements.  With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so."

The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering.  CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber physical systems.

Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and spear-phishing, typically gain user trust via impersonation to induce behaviors or elicit sensitive information that compromise security of an information system.  At present, defending against social engineering attacks falls entirely to users.  ASED aims to prevent social engineering attacks by creating counter-social-engineering bots that act on behalf of users to mediate and aggregate communications, and auto-identify attackers.  If successful, ASED will greatly reduce the effectiveness of adversary social engineering attacks and improve the security of DoD information systems."

These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will assimilate poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets.

Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems. The SSITH program moves to Project ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technology, in FY 2019."

If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions, and AI will be critical to such systems. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust.  Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, or not meaningful to a human user.  XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models meaningful to end-users.  XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation autonomous, data analytics, and decision-support systems."

Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, machine learning, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems.

Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.  As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources.  These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance\/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response."

In particular, this program is focused on improving DoD processes that, because of the need for excessive human involvement, create bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities.  If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly reduce the time and cost associated with many important developmental, approval and certification processes.  One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to minimal human intervention.  Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems.  Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models.  AAI application areas include the following:  (1) machine-enabled techniques to reduce human engagement in determining trustworthiness and intent; (2) automated approaches for accreditation of military software systems; and (3) technologies to restore movement and sensation to central nervous system impaired patients."

For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human society.  Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security.  Many important events are not simple occurrences but complex phenomena that are composed of numerous subsidiary event elements, some of which happen simultaneously while others are sequential and dependent on each other.  Humans make sense of event sequences by organizing them into narrative structures that may occur or re-occur frequently.  These structures are abstracted into schemas - organized units of knowledge that represent patterns - for the purpose of cognition. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that use existing schemas and, when needed, create new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multi-media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies will enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately."

                        "val": "The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics Technology and Information Analytics Technology.\n\nThe Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.\n\nThe Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also develop methods that fundamentally change the calculus of battle including consideration of a mix of assets, potentially disposable or with limited lifespans, with increased levels of autonomy are included.\n\nThe Aeronautics Technology project addresses high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and\/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.\n\nThe Information Analytics Technology project develops technology for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal\/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems.  Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes.  Benefits sought include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon; an enhanced capability to plan, monitor, and control diverse military operations ranging from stability operations to combat; and improvements to the efficiency of core military functions such as national and homeland security, warfighter health and readiness, and defense support of law enforcement and civil authorities.  Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition."

Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long range sensors, MAD-FIRES advances fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new system and as an upgrade to existing gun systems with applications to various domain platforms across a multitude of missions to include: ship self-defense, precision air to ground combat, precision ground to ground combat, counter unmanned air vehicles (C-UAV), and counter rocket and artillery and mortar (C-RAM)."

Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion.  The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art.  These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention. In FY 2020, this program is also funded in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy."

The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality.  This project will develop methods and technologies to expand the maneuver trade space to include the vertical dimension, including subterranean environments, and will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to enable integrated manned-unmanned operations and decrease warfighter exposure through the use of autonomous agents."

The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.

The program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact.  Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior. This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA will explore scenarios and probing behaviors that will enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals with hostile intent. This mission will require the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments.  URSA will develop new search and probing behaviors to expose human intent and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat. It will implement new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these probing actions to improve confidence in its decisions, and will build a novel framework for escalating nonlethal force."

The urban environment creates unique challenges in providing solutions for mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment.  Every pound that a warfighter wears or carries reduces their mobility and mission effectiveness, and, particularly in urban combat, reduced mobility paradoxically reduces their survivability.  The Rapunzel program seeks to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research.  Rapunzel envisions soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets and concealment.  The program will identify those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties. The Rapunzel program will leverage extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use."

A tactical decision engine will receive and process incoming sensor data to form an understanding of mission context, environment, and individual agent role and posture.  Based on this knowledge, the tactical decision engine will establish a contextually-relevant personalized operating picture for each node\/individual in accordance with their current status and mission goal and then guide action (e.g. heading and urgency) via interface modalities appropriate to the current state. 3HNDRED will assess and integrate hands-free, heads-up interfaces to convey information to the warfighter that can be quickly detected and intuitively understood without cognitive burden, enabling rapid response. 3HNDRED will enable collaborative actions between dismounted and mounted elements across manned and unmanned teams, and support on-the-fly force re-composition, providing an asymmetric advantage to U.S. ground forces."

The program goal was to improve on the existing, lightweight unguided munition systems by increasing range, accuracy, and lethality, while reducing cost.  These improvements leveraged advances in miniaturization, precision guidance and warheads.  Precision Kinetic Light Strike sought to take advantage of commercial technologies whenever possible to provide a low-cost, multi-use, and multi-function precision engagement capability.

Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests. Beginning in FY 2019 this effort is funded under PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01."

These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations, each of which has priorities, sensitivities, and concerns that may differ significantly.  Current mission design and planning technologies do not adequately model the range of options or the inherent uncertainties.

D3M will address this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models.  D3M technologies will include a library of data modeling primitives that are automatically selectable; automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives; and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts.

Monitoring and controlling WMT pathways is essential to denying access to WMT technology, knowledge, materials, expertise, and weapons.  MAA will create graph models reflecting prototypical WMT pathways, develop methods for creating merged activity graphs by aligning entities across multiple intelligence modalities, develop algorithms to match empirical activity graphs with pathway models, and create synthetic data sets at scale to support development and testing of WMT activity detection techniques.  MAA technology will transition to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)."

ACK will address this challenge by utilizing a decentralized approach to allocating resources to tasks and assigning mission orders to assets, motivated by ideas developed in online commerce, sourcing, and supply chain management, such as bid requests and offers.  The impact of ACK will be to accelerate asset re-allocation and assignment decision timelines to be on the order of minutes, and the output of ACK will be automated tools and decision aids to support the selection of the elements of a kill-chain and assignment of roles and responsibilities to each of the elements.

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, and these attacks are typically handled by individual organizations as they occur. Analyzing network summary data across a wide array of networks can make it possible to identify trends and patterns visible only when the data is viewed as a whole. Network Defense developed novel algorithms and analysis tools that enable a big picture approach for identifying illicit behavior in networks. This analysis and subsequent feedback to system administrators, security engineers, and decision makers can enhance information security in both the government and commercial sectors."

Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of technology areas including manufacturing, electronics, sensors, optics, and complex and autonomous systems.\n\nThe Biologically Based Materials and Devices project will leverage the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences for the development of new DoD capabilities.  Contained in this project are thrusts that apply biology's unique fabrication and manufacturing capabilities to produce and detect novel DoD relevant chemicals, materials at scale, and devices for overmatch.  Example projects include analyzing biological threats at the cellular and molecular level, mitigating the effect of threat agents on deployed warfighters, and developing remote, persistent sensor systems to detect terrestrial and maritime threats.  This project also includes efforts to develop novel technologies for maintaining human combat performance."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.\n\nResearch thrusts focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Success is predicated on tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (those tolerant of harsh environments).

                        "val": "The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.  The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.\n\nAdvances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronic Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards.\n\nThe Electronic Technology project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies.\n\nThis project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.\n\nThe Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. These limits present a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include materials, architectures, and designs intended to suit a specific need. In addition, the Beyond Scaling Technology Project recognizes that the envisioned electronics specialization will require proper security safeguards. Electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and explore techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware."

HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  Opportunities for transferring HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program.  Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.

When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.

These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.  WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time.  Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in both the visible and the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available.  However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR\/MWIR bands.  WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR\/MWIR.  The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art."

Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices.  These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems.  MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components.

Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare (EW); and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled.  By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1,000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations.  ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments.  Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability."

The resulting technologies would enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems.  Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP-C reductions at lower performance.  LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur.  These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets."

In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis.  Practical application, however, has been limited.  Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities.  The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources.  The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal.  This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.  In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and Ultralow Frequency (ULF) communications."

Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals. Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference.  DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs.  The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power."

WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users, and vulnerable to interference and jamming. WISPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, electronic warfare (EW) communications deception, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations of future C4ISR missions. The program develops an ultra-broadband compact antenna, radio frequency front end electronics, mixed signal circuits, and featureless waveform technologies. The WiSPER program will culminate with the integration and demonstration of a secured communication link.  The WiSPER program moved from ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technologies, in FY 2019."

Currently fielded systems are either broadband infrared sensors that rely on shape and brightness to identify targets or hyperspectral sensors that rely on color to identify targets.

Today's multi-function phased arrays that cover broad bandwidth are open to all frequencies with little or no RF filtering.  This is due to a lack of reconfigurable filtering that is small enough to integrate into the arrays,  limiting the use of wideband multi-function arrays in contested environments.  The ability to create reconfigurable bandpass and bandstop filters in the range of 2-18 GHz will be important to implementing transmit\/receive modules in next generation multi-function arrays.  Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference.  Specifically, in electronic warfare, it would be advantageous to be able to listen while jamming.  Instinctual RF will develop the signal cancellation devices that will listen to the transmit signal and subtract the interfering signal from the input of the receiver so that it will be able to hear faint signals near the noise floor.  Instinctual RF research will provide feedback mechanisms that instinctively correct these problems, much like the nerves of the human body serve to trigger protective action without conscious thought. Whether for self-induced interference or external interference jamming, this program will show the ability to auto-correct and allow for continued operation."

However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.

As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics cost, speed, and power derived from silicon scaling, the DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies by using design tools that enable circuit specialization. Research efforts will explore technologies and techniques such as intelligent design tools, automated physical layout generation, open-source circuit designs, and complete hardware emulation prior to manufacturing. Further research will also develop tools to create exact representations of outdated hardware in the field and to rapidly, cheaply, and safely upgrade these systems with next-generation electronics.  The goal of this program is to reduce the barrier to entry for complex system-on-chip (SoC) designs and to provide a secure pathway for the rapid upgrade of electronics. Advances under this program will demonstrate a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide electronics improvements that do not depend on continued, rapid silicon scaling.

In addition, the Beyond Scaling Technology Project recognizes that the envisioned electronics specialization will require proper security safeguards. Electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and explore techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.

Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  This program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  Research areas will include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, \"sticky logic\" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies.  The program aims to demonstrate the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.  Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach.

As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics cost, speed, and power derived from silicon scaling, the DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies by using design tools that enable circuit specialization. Research efforts will explore technologies and techniques such as intelligent design tools, automated physical layout generation, open-source circuit designs, and complete hardware emulation prior to manufacturing. Further research will also develop tools to create exact representations of outdated hardware in the field and to rapidly, cheaply, and safely upgrade these systems with next-generation electronics.  The goal of this program is to reduce the barrier to entry for complex system-on-chip (SoC) designs and to provide a secure pathway for the rapid upgrade of electronics. Advances under this program will demonstrate a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide electronics improvements that do not depend on continued, rapid silicon scaling.  Rapid design and deployment techniques developed will also consider the need to incorporate security into DoD hardware.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-02.

Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems.  The SSITH program moved from Project IT-03, Information Assurance and Survivability, in FY 2019."

Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.

Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems.  Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap.  Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data.  To overcome these limitations, DRBE will leverage advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems.  The electronics architecture which supports these goals is beyond anything that exists today, based on the power and latency requirements that this emulation environment demands.  DRBE will pursue three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling.  The resulting test environment should allow plug-and-play connections for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test.  Multi-system exercises could then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations. DRBE should therefore serve to develop CONOPS, inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems."

When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months.  The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics.  To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies.  These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs.

Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.  A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.  The N-ZERO program moved from Project ELT-01, Electronics Technology, in FY 2019."

Programs will explore new architectural concepts that employ a mix of weapon technologies that achieve lethality through a combination of overwhelming performance and overwhelming numbers rather than through the use of singular and costly high value assets.

Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests.  OpFires will leverage and integrate ongoing investments in hypersonics to achieve these objectives.  The transition partner is the Army.

Technologies will be explored to allow increased levels of autonomy, improved operating ranges, improved mobility through complex 3-dimensional battlespaces, and integration of the requirements for both ground and air mobility in complex urban warfare settings.  Reduced manning requirements will be a part of the design space evaluation, with unmanned vehicles operating in a supporting role instead of a traditional supported role.  Novel approaches to launch and recovery that reduce the need for highly trained personnel dedicated to monitoring unmanned vehicles will be explored.  Problems that cross all domains, such as high energy density power supplies, navigation through uncertain and changing environments, and supervisory autonomy of vehicles will be addressed.  Novel networking approaches will also be explored to close the seams between ground and air unmanned vehicles and to improve confidence in identifying risks associated with both natural hazards and enemy actions prior to ground personnel entering an area.  Cueing from other assets and long range, long duration autonomous assets will be included in the overall tradespace explored."

TERN enabled novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts enabled a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  DARPA transitioned the TERN program to the Office of Naval Research for continued development in Q4 FY 2018."

This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced\/maintained.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Development of smaller, simpler, and more agile launch vehicles and infrastructure will be pursued.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies as well as exploring novel in-space manufacturing technologies and techniques will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems.  Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution\/reconstitution of assets, and agility\/functionality not previously available for military systems."

Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems.  The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program seeks to establish the capability to provide robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners and national security space operators, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability.  Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool\/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer.  To support the development of a broadly accepted satellite servicing capability, DARPA is using the consortium for execution of rendezvous and servicing operations (CONFERS) approach to bring together experts from the private sector and Government to develop and publish non-binding, consensus-based standards for safe operational approaches."

For the simultaneous purposes of responsiveness and resiliency, these spacecraft are envisioned to be built on dramatically faster timelines (weeks instead of years) than are executed today. The current practice for space launch generally favors large launch vehicles with complex, one-of-a-kind infrastructure. This architecture has been matched to the large, heavy spacecraft, which compose most of DoD's space architecture today. Small spacecraft, which offer large potential value for resiliency and tactical employment, are typically required to rideshare for access to space which requires programmatic, technical, and schedule entanglement with other programs. The U.S. commercial sector has promising developments for small launch vehicles that are designed for launch on rapid timescales with minimal fixed infrastructure. To incentivize industry to deliver capability that can meet emerging DoD needs for rapid, responsive launch of small payloads, the DARPA Launch Challenge will reward competitors who can demonstrate the ability to launch a payload to orbit with minimal notification time and unknown pre-conditions regarding the payload configuration, required orbit, and launch site. The U.S. Government can make future use of commercial contracting mechanisms for rapid space launch with successful performers. The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and NASA."

Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe Mixed Technology Integration project funds the advanced development and demonstration of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of technologies with funded development and demonstration activities include, but are not limited to: (1) self-contained laser weapon systems to protect airborne platforms from emerging surface-to-air missiles; (2) integrated photonic-electronic components for positioning, navigation and timing in GPS-denied environments; (3) flexible, software-defined cameras that enable real-time image analysis of complex scenes to provide more actionable information; and (4) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital) or mixed semiconductor technology to substantially improve the capability of existing components and\/or reduce their size, weight and power.  Funding under this project is intended to advance transitioning novel technologies to use, providing advanced components compatible with mid-term and other future warfighting requirements.\n\nThe Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies project is a continuation of DARPA's basic and applied research in this area and will support activities in large scale co-development with leading industry players to enable and accelerate transformative computing interactions with industry. Additionally, funding under this project will include establishing access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) and state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries for DoD microelectronics fabrication runs, developing a manufacturable photonics and wide bandgap process, creating a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) multi-project wafer flow, and establishing an application center to capture DoD microelectronics requirements."

These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical\/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems.  Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC.  Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates.  These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame.  Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements.  Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame.  The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs.  Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information.  The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band.  By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs should enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army."

In order to accomplish this, the program will leverage recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for EMW techniques. Currently, the development cycle for EMW algorithms is long and costly. However, they must be able to evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats. The programmed RAD testbeds will ultimately train warfighters on how to deal with legacy and emerging threats in the RF spectrum through maneuvers, signal jamming tactics, signal intelligence gathering, and other missions. The outcome of RAD will be better tactics, techniques, and procedures for handling EMW as well as the identification of new technology assets for deploying EMW capabilities. Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the Services through a series of demonstrations proving a radically shorter time scale of development."

EUCLID plans to leverage advances in thermal management components to design, build, test, and demonstrate densely packageable, prototype DPMs that are less than half the size of their commercial counterparts.  The program will also pursue improved optical components that can more efficiently focus light from individual laser diodes.

Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor.  We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35.  One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile.  This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously.  This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages.  To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block.  The program will be executed in two primary technical areas.  First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems.  Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system.   The MIDAS program moves to Project MT-16, Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies, in FY 2019."

Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. In some cases, the inability to place orders in volume has created a lack of access to advanced technology nodes entirely. To address this, the DoD must participate in more industry partnerships that not only leverage investments in the commercial industry but also provide access to SOTA facilities in the U.S. This program will build on existing relationships and forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include establishing access to commercial SOTA and SOTP foundries for DoD microelectronics fabrication runs, developing a manufacturable photonics and wide bandgap process, creating a microelectromechanical systems multi-project wafer flow, and establishing an application center to capture DoD microelectronics requirements.

Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor.  We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35.  One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile.  This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously.  This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages.  To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block.  The program will be executed in two primary technical areas.  First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems.

While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users. The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces. Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:\n- High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.\n- Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, scalability, and composable systems to enable adaptive effects webs.\n- Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD\/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments.\n- Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF\/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats."

SHARE will provide the level of security provided by today's communications systems, while managing trust at the tactical edge.  Building upon the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program, which is budgeted in this PE\/Project, and research into the use of commercial systems and infrastructure to support military operations, SHARE provides new opportunities for U.S. and coalition forces to gain and maintain a tactical advantage on the battlefield.  Coordination includes providing all the information required to enable the command and control necessary to plan and execute operations in all phases of warfare.

The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services."

During these network outages, data transmission is not possible.  Building on technologies explored in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also in this PE\/Project, the Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments.  Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost.  The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links.  The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links.

The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor and radar bands with communication systems.  The program will leverage technologies originally developed for radar anti-jam and interference mitigation that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will transition to the Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA)."

Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems strained the size of networks that current communications technology could support in the contested environment.  As adversary capabilities advanced, the DoD needed new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability.  As part of Advanced Networking technologies efforts, the C2E program addressed these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, it developed heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols were developed.  Second, the program created a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that drew from commercial communication architectures.  The defense contractor community built specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture.  Finally, C2E created a government controlled development environment to allow for rapid refresh of communications technology and allowed third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Navy."

It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.\n\nThe objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  \n\nThe Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic\/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical\/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations."

The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.

To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications), while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  RSPACE will also develop tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy."

The program will deliver an initial instantiation of a scalable experimentation engine capable of aircraft control at levels ranging from an advanced tactical autopilot to a form of multi-domain mosaic controller.  Experiments will explore both augmentation of existing manned platforms and increased capabilities and intelligence of future unmanned systems.  ACE will provide an early opportunity to experiment with adaptive human-machine teaming to deliver tools and architectures as the Joint Multi-Domain Battle concept evolves within the Services.  Higher-fidelity simulated adversary human behavior will also be developed to ensure blue operators conducting experiments are faced with more realistic dilemmas posed by computer-played adversaries.

The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program was to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location.  ReACT provides this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture.  The key technical challenge was to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  The ReACT system sensed the target's emissions and then optimally configured the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Air Force and Navy."

Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain and maintain location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy."

Ocean of Things builds upon advances made in the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program, budgeted in this PE\/Project. Ocean of Things will develop large numbers of heterogeneous sensing  floats to cover large ocean areas, while incorporating environmentally friendly construction materials. These platforms will leverage satellite communications to populate a large data repository with sensor outputs for shared processing. Ocean of Things will apply advanced analysis techniques to the stored data to synthesize and discover new signals and behaviors in the ocean environment. The program will research the spatio-temporal composability of sensors and develop applications for distributed platform behavior using an internet of things (IoT) architecture deployed across the world's oceans. Further research will examine additional platform capabilities and system impacts of  communication rate and edge processing. The Ocean of Things program will improve ocean awareness and provide persistent coverage to areas between existing platforms. Technologies developed in Ocean of Things will transition to the Navy."

This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost-effective deployment technologies.  The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to restore connectivity temporarily for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small-diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will emphasize early risk reduction with scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.

Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.  The Blue Wolf program provided a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges addressed included, dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment.  The program leveraged Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies. Under an existing Memorandum of Agreement, following vehicle integration and initial testing, the program is transitioning to the Navy."

This new propulsor enabled the Navy to operate its submarine fleet with improved capability, allowing for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines can exploit expanded areas previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The Navy has evaluated this component in sea trials.  It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Columbia Class submarines, and could back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class submarines.  Technology developed under this program has transitioned to the Navy."

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.\n\nThe Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets."

Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use.  Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms.  The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows an Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options.  This program focuses on the development of payloads to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation.  The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas.  Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army, Marine Corps, and Department of Homeland Security."

The Multi-Optical Sensing (MOS) program enabled an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter-class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leveraged emerging high-sensitivity Focal Plane Array (FPA) and compact, multi-band laser systems technology in the near\/mid\/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-optical sensing system.  Technical challenges included the demonstration of inexpensive, multi-band, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The MOS program advanced the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Air Force."

The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments."

Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, COMPASS will employ active sensing and recommend actions that U.S. Forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, COMPASS will build and demonstrate tools to 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments.

Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments, the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary\/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program developed a real-time spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging sensor that provides imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program transitioned to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM)."

Protecting these systems currently relies on uniquely identifying an enemy radar and applying an appropriate, pre-programmed Electronic Countermeasure (ECM), which can take years to develop.  The emergence of digitally-programmed radars that exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics, however, has made this approach to countering radar-based threats increasingly challenging.  Developing new ECM over several years is no longer sufficient.  ARC developed new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  The program transitioned to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps airborne electronic warfare systems."

The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battle space focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness. \n\nThis Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology). The networked sensing and data fusion efforts performed in this Project complement efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers) \/ Project H50 (Network Sciences CTA) and PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers) \/ Project J15 (Network Science ITA).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nFY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

To address the challenges of integrating multiple technologies and sub-systems, research conducted in this PE, significant Science and Technology applied research investments in all areas of Soldier Lethality focus on how to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes and apply systems-level practices to mitigate constraints from size and weight of the equipment. Research areas encompass individual and crew-served weapon designs and technologies as well as applied research in lightweight and transparent armor materials to mitigate effects from blast and ballistic threats, counter explosive hazard detection, counter-sensor capabilities, and signature management of weapons, equipment, personnel and high value targets. This PE investigates, develops and designs materials, technologies, methodologies and system models required to experiment and optimize Soldier lethality and survivability through investments in mobility, human-agent teaming, and improved situational awareness interfaces and display technologies as well as to provide Soldier-borne power and energy materials and components that support multiple Soldier-borne systems. This PE also investigates Warfighter training technologies and develops the underpinning technologies to establish architecture standards and interfaces necessary for creating realistic synthetic environments to create a single, interconnected synthetic training system to enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon \/ multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. Human Factors Engineering projects conduct applied research to design weapon systems standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training curriculum and tools. \n\nResults of these efforts are transitioned within the Army Futures Command, the Program Executive Offices, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0603118A, Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology.\n\nThere are no new starts in this Program Element.\n\nAll FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Research encompasses conducting applied research to develop metrics, measures, tools, and techniques to quantify and understand the relationships that enable maximum effectiveness of integrated Soldier-augmentation technologies. The resulting data are the basis for physical augmentation systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, and intelligent agent requirements to improve equipment operation and Soldier-system synergy. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, reduced Soldier training requirements, enhanced Soldier lethality\/survivability, user acceptance, and allow Soldiers to achieve maximum performance. Major efforts explore novel techniques for Soldier assessment, characterization of individual variability effects on performance, development of evidence based design guidance for the application of augmentation technologies, exploration of the relationship of exoskeleton and physical assist device adaptation and baseline Soldier parameters such as gait, neuromuscular motor control and proprioception. This Project will also explore novel training paradigms for reduced Soldier-augmentation technology adaptation times to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit wearable sensor technologies, translate surrogate task performance to operational outcomes, develop approaches to distinguish tasks and individual state and intent of movement, establish database of human movement variability to inform intelligent system design, and identify high impact applications of augmentation. \n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and leverages the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ Project BC2 (Next Gen Mobility & Lethality Tech for Warfighters), Project BB9 (Human Performance Tech for Mobility & Lethality), and Project BC6 (Human Perf - Tech for Warfighter Enhancement) and supports PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) \/ Project BC1 (Human Performance AdvTech for Mobility & Lethality), Project BB6 (Physical Augmentation: Adv Tech for Field Demo), and Project BB8 (Soldier Centric Advanced Technology).

The resulting data are the basis for physical augmentation systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, and intelligent agent requirements to improve equipment operation and Soldier-system synergy. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, reduced Soldier training requirements, enhanced Soldier lethality\/survivability, user acceptance, and allows the Soldier and systems to jointly achieve maximum performance. Major efforts explore novel techniques for Soldier assessment, characterization of individual variability effects on performance, and development of evidence based design guidance for the application of augmentation technologies to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit wearable sensor technologies, translate surrogate task performance to operational outcomes, develop approaches to distinguish tasks and individual state, establish database of human movement variability to inform intelligent system design, and identify high impact applications of augmentation.\n\nResults of these efforts are transitioned to the Research, Development, and Engineering Centers, Program Executive Offices (PEO), Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nFY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The result is increased mission effectiveness that enables strong mission command, intelligence operations, and cyber defenses, which lead to high information sharing, situational awareness, and collaboration. Major efforts focus on applied research to understand the conduct of effective CEMA operations in that knowledge is required to create and effectively deploy cyber work systems that optimize human-machine interactions and account for operator and adversary behavior to achieve maximum effects.

Innovative materials will be sought that are capable of sensing and responding, as well as adapting response, to a broad spectrum of environmental variables. Research will develop materials that are able to self-monitor, self-heal and self-sustain. Research will explore new biology-based methods for controlled synthesis and assembly to create materials with precise chemistries, microstructures, properties, and responsive functionalities through controlled molecular placement, spatial architectures, and interfacial structures. These materials have potential to enable more survivable, situationally aware, lighter weight Soldier systems and electronics.

Areas of emphasis include parachute technologies, parachutist injury reduction, precision offset aerial delivery, soft landing technologies, and airdrop simulation.  Technologies support the Soldier Lethality Army Modernization Priority.  New operational concepts call for increased precision of personnel and cargo in austere environments in which small units are dispersed and logistical supply is limited.  The Army requires enhanced payload extraction and other increased capabilities to support the airdrop requirement for current and future vehicles exceeding aircraft payload weight capacity. The U.S. Army Airborne Board (Chaired by the XVIII Airborne Corps Commanding General) identified increased payload capabilities as a critical requirement to support the mission readiness profile for the Global Response Force (GRF), and will support Joint Forcible Entry requirements while maximizing the capacity of a C-17 aircraft.  \n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and complements the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences),  PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ Project BD6 (Soldier Sys Interfaces\/ Integration- Sensor Tech), and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) \/Project BE5 (Personnel & Airdrop Safety Advanced Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

This research will develop the capability to generate a near real-time site model with appropriate engineering details to allow unmanned shaping of the environment through physical interaction (e.g. push, pull, lift, or dig). This effort will also develop the requisite mission planner and task execution controller that accepts input from the user and provides suggestions and feedback based on updates to the site model, reporting from hardware agents, and resource allocation logic. The end state goal is the development of beyond visual line of sight teleoperation and semiautonomous capabilities allowing Engineer robotic support to match pace in near term and future combat environments. This effort will support the development, testing, and evaluation of prototypical robotic Combat Engineer equipment. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground and Next Generation Combat Vehicle Portfolio.\n\nAll FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Engineer Research and Development Center.\n\nThis effort is coordinated with PE 0603462A (NGCV Advanced Technology)."

This Project will enable future crews to perform complex missions with increasingly sophisticated technologies, and in increasingly complex, dynamic socio-technical environments. The applied research will provide the fundamental technologies to enable integrated performance-improving Learning - Warfighter Machine Interfaces (WMIs) that are scalable to multiple crew hardware and functional configurations; reconfigurable frameworks and simulation for concept experimentation and exploration; and team-centered dynamic tasking by machine intelligence to effectively utilize full capabilities of crew and technologies.  The research will generate soldier-informed data, reports, and analysis to support operational use in future vehicles; and soldier experimentation and assessment of technical concepts in simulation and in-field WMIs. The capabilities created by this research will lead to increased overall crew and team performance; improved soldier safety due to fewer soldier per vehicle, closed-hatch operations, and improved standoff from effective control; and vehicles that can effectively perform across multiple domains of battle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command. \n\nThis work is done in coordination with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology)."

Work conducted in this Project will result in concepts for Adaptive and Cooperative Protection of ground combat vehicles.  Modern protective technology implements complex kinematic mechanisms in order to bend, break and disperse threat projectiles before they can injure crew or disable vehicles.  These \"mechanisms\" of the future will have unprecedented access to information through advanced sensors (electro-optic, infrared, radio frequency, magnetic, acoustic), data, communications, high speed digital signal processing, and fusion of information to initiate high-speed controls and actuation to adjust and adapt protective measures and materials.  The research strategy will develop experimental and computational tools and techniques (high resolution instrumentation to observe impact events, theories and algorithms to explain these phenomena and numerical implementation of these algorithms) for the development of mass-efficient armor mechanisms.  Complimentary armor mechanisms will be co-developed to create multi-threat armor technologies that meet specific military requirements and these will form the building blocks for Adaptive and Cooperative Protection Technologies.  Additionally research will focus on subcomponent\/component models to predict performance of early concepts and the means to evaluate effectiveness on ground platforms.  The Project will balance developments of active threat defeat measures with the necessary advanced passive and reactive components that will ultimately provide for full system solutions which meet the requirements of current and next generation ground tactical and combat vehicles.  The Emerging Overmatch Technologies effort will maximize the synergy between protection technologies that are complimentary to the lethality mission to re-establish overmatch of Army technologies.  \n\nThis Project is coordinated with and transition to Projects in PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and builds upon weapon target interaction research in PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) \/ Project AA7 (Mechanics and Ballistics).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle."

Data collection investigates the usage of both simulation and live data. Simulation will provide a baseline to collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for developing algorithms to enable both intelligent formation control and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) map input for Unmanned Ground Vehicle Mobility.  This Project will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using ML and other AI methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI\/ML techniques to develop intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for Global Positioning System. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to develop algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI\/ML techniques to develop intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAV mapped areas. Data collected from the UAV will be converted to maneuverable information for manned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go\/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nThis work is conducted by the United States Army Futures Command.\n\nThis work is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicles Advanced Technology)."

The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and distributed sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by distributed electronics is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF and optoelectronic circuits, devices, materials and wireless power (and data) transfer. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

New atmospheric sensing technologies are developed that enable near-real-time, high-resolution measurements of atmospheric parameters via light-weight systems that can be employed in tactical domains. Efforts include high-resolution local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions that can accommodate the effects of dense urban and complex, mountainous terrain. Both physics-based and rule-based decision support systems are developed for assessing the impacts of weather\/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution; battlefield visualization; reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web-enabled tactical decision aids, long-range precision fires; and modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games\n\nThis work provides technologies for evaluation by and\/or transitions to the Department of Defense weather and operations community including: Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammunition-PM Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for meteorological message input to field artillery targeting systems; Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A); the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) to improve their operational weather support to the Army.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

This  will permit enhanced survivability of the FVL platforms with restored visual overmatch in any (day\/night) environment.

Improved detection and identification capability will result from filtering out scattered light and enabling 3-dimensional ranging through environmental obscurants.  Wavelength agile imaging systems will be delivered that are capable of penetrating and imaging through a variety of obscurants and that are compatible with the FVL platforms."

This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)\/electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) guided missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. It focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. Project CYB designs, creates, evaluates, and applies emerging cyber techniques and cyber situational awareness technologies to enhance Army capabilities and to mitigate risks and investigates cyber collection and mapping technologies to offer real time cyber situational awareness to enable interpretation of current threats and predict future enemy activities.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and is coordinated with PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fused munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This Project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)\/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with, and as appropriate leveraged by, DEW and power\/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.\n\nThis Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, Soldier and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Portfolios.\n\nThe work in this Project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC\/ARSTRAT).  \n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to RF communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution. Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of five key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, wireless power transfer, and advanced battery chemistries.  Additionally, materials and devices used for photonic applications, such as laser diodes and fiber lasers, will be studied and improved with an emphasis on overall size, weight, and power consumption efficiency gains."

Focus areas are sensor components, sub-components, and software algorithms to improve detection of mines and explosive threats; novel methods to defeat mines and explosive threats; and signature management technologies to reduce the reconnaissance capabilities of enemy forces. The technologies being investigated are for both mounted and dismounted applications. Project H24 (Countermine Technology) investigates state of the art counter explosive hazard technologies to accurately detect and neutralize threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo. Project H35 (Camouflage and Counter-Recon Tech) designs and develops advanced sensor protection, signature management, and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions. \n\nWork in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state, and local environmental\/health laws and to reduce the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, technologies to empower rapid fielding of next generation energetics, propellants and munitions with focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond, and enable decision making based on accurate environmental conditions in sparse data environments. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution, and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations. Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling, and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions, and develops environmental sensor capabilities to enable rapid collection and analysis of data for real-time environmental situational awareness. \n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nTechnologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Futures Command (AFC)."

These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide. To develop the required technologies, this Project has a focus on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination, and other waste streams; a focus on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation, and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing missions; a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced, and cost effective technologies or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste; and a focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond. The resultant technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment."

This Project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The Project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment."

Project 779 researches and develops MC software, algorithms, protocols, architectures, and devices that enable management of information across the tactical and strategic battle space; provides automated cognitive reasoning and decision making aids; allows timely distribution, presentation\/display and use of MC data on Army platforms; and researches alternatives to Global Positioning System (GPS) for positioning, navigation and timing. Project CY2 investigates cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA), cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber-attacks and new mobile networking protocols that afford resilience within our networks to autonomically 'fight through' and\/or evade hostile cyber effects. Project H92 supports research in communications components, software, algorithms and protocols, which allow field commanders to communicate on-the-move to\/from virtually any location, through a seamless, secure, self-organizing, self-healing network.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology) , PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0603270A (EW Technology), PE 0603772A (Adv Tactical Computer Science & Sensor Technology), and PE 0603794A (C3 Advanced Technology).\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and develops software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and develops materiel solutions, including rapidly emplaced bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with protective construction and critical infrastructure. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to assess non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy..\n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology).\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, and homeland security. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the capability of autonomous engineering during combat operations to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk\/threat and dynamic environments, enables installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and on-demand expeditionary structures, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in contingency operations, including urban environments.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi."

Numerical modeling of weather effects on terrain properties supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command-delivered solutions to the Soldier. The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi."

This PE develops new personnel measures and methods that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE develops new performance measures and metrics for individuals and units, designs innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints. \n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0603007A (Manpower, Personnel and Training Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Vision, the Army's Talent Management Strategy, and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork is performed by the Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences at Fort Belvoir, VA."

Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Military Relevant Infectious Diseases, Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine, Medical Capabilities to Support Dispersed Operations, and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences.\n\nProject 869 Warfighter Health Prot & Perf Stnds \nDescription: Refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and behavioral health problems (e.g., suicide, substance abuse) and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighters from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e., the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.\n\nProject 870 Dod Med Def Ag Inf Dis \nDescription: Designs and refines drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic assays\/tests devices, other preventive measures for protection and treatment against naturally occurring infectious diseases as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.\n\nProject 874 Cbt Casualty Care Tech\nDescription: Identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and associated clinical practices for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, and life support, with emphasis on provision of prolonged field care when medical evacuation and access to definitive surgical care is delayed. Focus is identification of more effective critical care technologies and clinical practices to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related injuries. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.\n\nProject ET4 Appl Resch in Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine \nDescription: Identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics, medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post-evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of wounded Service Members. This Project is coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.\n\nProject VB4 System Biology and Network Science Technology \nDescription: Includes strategic oversight, direction and management of applied research in integrative systems biology of military relevant conditions, and the Systems Biology Collaboration Center (SBCC). The SysBioCube (a biomedical research data integration and analysis system), managed by the SBCC, provides the ability for multi-site collaborative efforts to integrate, visualize and evaluate complex data using innovative technologies. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and coagulopathy (a disorder that impairs the blood's ability to form clots) projects have utilized the systems biology analytical and visualization within the SysBioCube to inform the development of prognostic indicators, objective diagnostics, and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies more quickly than non-systems approaches. The SBCC also serves as a Medical Research Materiel Command (MRMC) resource for data sharing and data management for maximizing the value of all research efforts across the Command.\n\nProject XV5 Medical Capabilities to Support Dispersed Ops \nDescription: Research to design, develop, and improve medical robotic and autonomous systems (Med-RAS), Virtual Health for telemedicine and remotely delivered patient care, and unmanned capabilities of providing or supporting combat casualty care in far-forward and dispersed geographic environments. This research includes the design of semi-autonomous and closed-loop combat casualty triage, diagnosis, physiological monitoring, therapeutic intervention, casualty evacuation, telemedicine\/tele-mentoring and emergency medical resupply technologies for integration with emerging multi-purpose Army Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) and Virtual Health\/Telemedicine delivery platforms while optimizing the medical logistic footprint.\n\nProject MK4 Warfighter Health Applied Rsch Technology \nDescription: Refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for PTSD, behavioral health problems, and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighters from injuries resulting from operational stress and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment.\n\nProject MM4 Cbt Casualty Care Applied Rsch Technology\nDescription: Identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices and associated clinical practices for field trauma care, resuscitation, and life support with emphasis on provision of prolonged field care when medical evacuation and access to definitive surgical care is delayed. Focus is identification of more effective critical care technologies and clinical practices to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related injuries.\n\nProject MM8 Infectious Diseases Applied Rsch Technology\nDescription: Applied research to design and refine drugs, vaccines, and other medical countermeasures against naturally occurring infectious diseases as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and capability needs assessments.\n\nProject MN1 Applied Sensory Systems Trauma Technology\nDescription: Research to understand the influence of stress on the effectiveness of pain relief drugs (analgesics).  This Project conducts laboratory and animal studies  for the purpose of developing novel, non-opioid drugs to treat pain in the austere battlefield environment with minimal side effects. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the United States Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use. \n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology\nCoordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas."

Evaluated at least one drug candidate modulating the activity of orexin\/hypocretin (a peptide found in the nervous system that regulates arousal, wakefulness and appetite) for its ability to mitigate the adverse behavioral effects of traumatic stress and traumatic conditioning processes. Continued studies focused upon identification of PTSD subtypes, stage of disease progression, and development of associated biomarkers for use in the identification and development of matched risk-based prevention interventions and development of a precision medicine algorithm approach to PTSD treatment. Determined the influence of sleep history on the efficacy and durability of Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT), which is a computerized treatment that involves retraining an individual's interpretation of other's facial expressions away from predisposed perceptions of hostility, shifting interpretations in the direction of neutrality, to reduce his or her level of anxiety. Conducted a study with Soldiers in an operational unit to determine the predictive validity of trial-by-trial attention bias analytics versus traditional measures. Developed and piloted an evidence-based, self-discipline education program that positively influences Soldier outcomes related to resilience and readiness through the development of adaptive self-control and emotion regulation. Developed and piloted emotion regulation leadership training modules for unit leaders. Developed and piloted an evidence-based, team-level intervention that positively influences Soldier outcomes related to behavioral health, resilience, and unit readiness through the regulation of small- team dynamics (e.g., group-affect). Developed and piloted an individual-to-tool matching paradigm that allows leaders to optimally tailor intervention strategies to precisely meet their personnel and operational health needs."

                                        "val": "This Project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1) Prevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases\n(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n \nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments."

The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is the integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, using global multi-omic methods to identify and discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions (physiologic, immunologic, endocrine, etc.), supporting transition of research to clinical applications. This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement as seen in biomarker development for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and enhanced analyses of coagulopathy. Another application of systems biology is to characterize physiological pathways altered by toxic substances enabling identification of the causative toxic substances as well as to understand the injury mechanisms. The detection\/identification of physiological markers of exposure to toxic substances can then be used to support medical countermeasure decisions or development of targeted therapeutic drugs.\n\nThese examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to Projects studying biological systems have been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the United States Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD."

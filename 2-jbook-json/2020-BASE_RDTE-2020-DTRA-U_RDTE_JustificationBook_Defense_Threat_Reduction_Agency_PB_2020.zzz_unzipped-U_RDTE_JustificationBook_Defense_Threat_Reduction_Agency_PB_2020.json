This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA\u2019s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development budget projects.\n\nThis project aligns with DTRA\u2019s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction and consequence management communities. The portfolio addresses this guidance through S&T investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Program managers drive interdisciplinary portfolios primarily drawing from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and information and network sciences. The portfolios themselves are broadly focused on fundamental, exploratory research to support the development of: standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; nuclear detection in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; WMD agent defeat technologies; and biologically-based and -inspired materials for DoD applications.\n\nThis project maintains a robust, forward-looking portfolio targeting mission-focused research demonstrating scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for breakthrough discoveries."

This process will focus novel UP research on high-priority CWMD gaps, to include energetics and reactives, nuclear data, weapons effects, materials science, machine learning, radiation biology, advanced analytics, and other critical areas.  This model reduces administrative burdens and increases technical collaboration with partners focused on current and emerging areas of interest thereby allowing for reduced investment in FY 2020."

This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA\u2019s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.\n\nThis project aligns with DTRA\u2019s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community. The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; securing vulnerable materials; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.\n\nThis project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD. The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation. Each research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions. This research will enable new capabilities to: better understand the environment, threats and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and\/or dispose of WMD threats; and safeguard the force by managing consequences."

These areas of investment continue to be identified time and again as challenging problem sets for the warfighters as identified by the CCMDs and warfighting commands in the CCMD integrated priority lists and JUONs. This is all in support of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering ASD(R&E) guidance and congressional testimony to provide the technological foundation that ensures the U.S. military of both today and tomorrow is the most capable in the fight against IEDs and emerging improvised threats. These resources will be applied to the following: designing and fabricating ultra-light weight auxetic structures that significantly reduce damage to vehicles through reducing deflection upon impact from mine blast; developing the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and unmanned aerial vehicle cameras needed to create a 3D map of an environment; developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methodologies to enable human understanding of Machine Learning decisions; developing fusion strategies to improve Machine Learning algorithms by including human-in-the- loop knowledge into its learning strategies; developing methods to optimize algorithms through artificial intelligence and machine learning; and forecasting future threat scenarios and threat network resiliency."

These efforts support DoD requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.\n\n2.  Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine technical capabilities needed to improve Department of Defense (DoD) contingency planning activities; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear.\n\n3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.\n\n4. Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs."

Defeat Technologies develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of WMD, while minimizing collateral effects. Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both. It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation CWMD capabilities. The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials. Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to Budget Activity (BA) 3, Advanced Technology Development (ATD) efforts. On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.\n\n2.  WMD counterforce technologies research develops weapons effects modeling algorithms, full and sub-scale test series required to investigate CWMD weapon effects and sensor performance, and visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation Technical Reachback cell. These activities are critical enablers for the development of advanced CWMD planning tools. Energetics research develops materials and weapon design technology providing defeat capabilities for engaging hard and deeply buried targets that are beyond current high explosive blast\/fragmentation warhead technology. Life sciences research develops technologies to find, locate, mitigate, and defeat WMD using bio-organisms or components."

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities. Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects."

The project leverages 50 years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD. Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.

FY 2020 supports increased investments in Advanced Technological Development (ATD) focused on Disruptive Technologies providing a greater than 70% solution to the following areas: Buried Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Attack the Network, Home-Made Explosives (HME), and System Attributes across the Portfolio Range including Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence. Strategically aligned investments include increased investments in improved autonomous capabilities supporting the detection and defeat of improvised threats and the integration of Artificial Reality (AR)\/Virtual Reality (VR) into C-IT capabilities.  These areas of investment continue to be identified time and again as challenging problem sets for the warfighters as identified by the CCMDs and warfighting commands in their Integrated Priority List (IPLs) and Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON).  The Continuation of ATD activities is critical to advancing current initiatives to the prototype phase in the following areas: Remote Controlled IED (RCIED) & Stand-off Detection.  This investment supports further development, testing, and prototyping of advanced Modelling, Visualization, and Simulation capabilities for processor-intensive analytics to support warfighters operating in tactical environments. The capability directly supports mission planning, targeting, and post-operation analysis by troops operating in tactical theaters of operation. For example, the capability will support mission planning by providing first-person experiential mission planning through immersion in a 3-D virtual model of a target mission environment that is augmented by inputs from multiple sensor platforms. The tactical user may interact with the virtual model of the target mission environment through head-mounted and\/or handheld devices. Mission planning augmented in this manner may improve targeting accuracy and provide improved force protection in tactical environments."

These efforts support DoD requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.\n\n2.  Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine technical capabilities needed to improve Department of Defense (DoD) contingency planning activities; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear.\n\n3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.\n\n4.  Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs."

                                        "val": "Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following areas.\n\n1.  Defeat Technologies develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.\n\n2.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved. Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability. Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.\n\n3.  Counter-terrorism technologies research develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent WMD threats. This research supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two areas: (1) counter proliferation research is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development and acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; (2) counterterrorism concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander, USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.\n\n4.  Counterforce technologies research develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions capabilities to find, characterize, assess, and plan for the defeat of WMD threats. This research is focused in three areas: (1) WMD battlespace awareness provides warfighters with tools to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats; (2) The weapons effects research provides modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations; (3) innovative engineering of select promising technologies discovered under fundamental and basic research to increase the effectiveness of weapons against blast doors and other underground structures for functional defeat of Underground Facilities (UGFs), WMD, and their delivery systems.\n\n5.  DTRA provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated weapons of mass destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing. This test bed is capable of responding to operational needs outside of DTRA\u2019s research portfolio and is used by the DoD, Military Services, Combatant Commanders, and other Federal Agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional weapons, and other special weapons used against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets.\n\n6.  Target assessment technologies research develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates, and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of WMD target assessment, automated advanced targeting development (A2TD) and full dimensional defeat. This research develops analytical tools and processes required to: (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs); and (2) assess the results of physical and functional defeat mechanisms (such as direct attack). The A2TD initiative seeks to apply emerging computer assisted technologies to automate target characterization for hard targets and WMD targets.  The end result will be faster and more efficient characterization of important hard targets and WMD targets. The full dimensional defeat project aims to develop an enterprise capability for finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts. The dynamic capabilities encompassed in this effort provide Combatant Commands and the intelligence community tools and processes needed to hold at risk high value hard targets and WMD targets possessed by adversaries."

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy. The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments. The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs."

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and to (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries."

DTRA builds counter-threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners. Through a robust communities of action approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments\/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) and Counter Improvised-Threat (C-IT) solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed US Joint Forces. This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire US Government and its partners as counter-improvised threat solutions are developed and realized.\n\nDTRA responds to the following improvised threats: Home-Made Explosives (HME), Vehicle-Borne IED (VBIED), Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-sUAS) Vehicle-Attached IED (VAIED), Anti-Armor IED (AIED) Buried IED, Radio Controlled IED (RCIED), Personnel-Borne IED (PBIED), Booby Trapped Structures (BTS), Improvised WMD, Water-Borne IED (WBIED), improvised threats within tunnels, and emerging threats that are identified by the warfighter deployed forward."

This system delivers data continuously to the U.S. monitoring and verification community supports warfighter and interagency nuclear-event response in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) objectives and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n\nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment. This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to countering WMD. Technical assessments are made against nuclear treaty implementation and nuclear event response requirements to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide U.S. International Monitoring System (IMS) data, and to access international IMS data required to support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.\n\nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is to improve the efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of U.S. IMS stations; optimize IMS capabilities to support both nuclear treaty monitoring and nuclear-event response; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of nuclear events. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies."

The IMS data availability\/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems. The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event. RDT&E is conducted in support of the NACT\u2019s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested."

DTRA\u2019s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.\n  \nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.\n \nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies."

The IMS data availability\/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event.  RDT&E is conducted in support of the NACT\u2019s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.  CTBT IMS data availability\/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.

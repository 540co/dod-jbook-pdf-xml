Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP)  supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress, and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The DURIP project supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation project complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research\ninstrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The PECASE project supports single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This project provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security."

In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.

MURI topics are selected to address Naval Science and Technology (S&T) Framework Priorities as described in the Naval Research and Development Framework. Funding for MURI efforts are awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramp up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by speeding up scientific programs, by cross-fertilization of ideas, by hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and by training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI projects are five year programs."

Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in technology and capability-related 'thrusts' which are consolidated in thirteen Naval Research and Development Framework focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet\/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.\n\nThe In-House Laboratory Independent Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to develop and maintain a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.\n\nILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers\/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.\n\nThis PE sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of Naval power and national security, by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs, and by providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). The research aligns to the Naval Research and Development Framework for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.\n\n\nDue to the number of efforts in PE 0601152N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.

Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).\n\nThis PE sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise. It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Research and Development Framework. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  \n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend. There are currently five NNRs.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support. Activities in this area also support maintenance of the Science and Engineering Workforce and STEM Education and Outreach.\n\nThis PE sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise. It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science & Technology Strategy. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  \n\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), S&T areas that are uniquely important to maintaining U.S. Naval superiority. With the designation in 2011 of Sea-Based Aviation as an NNR, there are currently five NNRs.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Naval Expeditionary Forces need science advances to address a range of Basic Research challenges that result from physical and operational environmental limitations so harsh that solutions push basic discovery and invention. Naval Forces able to operate amphibiously and in the littoral will have all of their capabilities exposed to degrading sea and land physical effects. Expeditionary forces operating austerely must be agile and lethal but will be constrained by size, weight, and power requirements and must be sustained across distributed forces covering large areas. Further complicating the problem context is the nature of hybrid threats, and adversaries. A hybrid adversary can be state or non-state using a combination of conventional and irregular methods and weapons. For example a hybrid threat could use criminal acts in concert with conventional artillery and IEDs and in turn social media for combined effects greater and broader than the sum of the parts. These coordinated multivariate threats occur across the spectrum of conflict with a dynamic but unified strategy. A hybrid adversary is flexible and adapts quickly, synchronizing advanced state weapons systems, disruptive commercial technologies, cheap expedient homemade weapons, and a variety of tactics. The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats program seeks to establish and nurture science to address these threats not covered in more conventional warfare science efforts and in environments not researched elsewhere.\n\nWithin the above threat and environmental context numerous warfighting capability dependencies are considered resulting in a broad range of science research areas. Examples include: physics addressing the electromagnetic spectrum for use in Command and Control and high energy physics addressing Directed Energy Weapons; machine perception, reasoning and collaborative behaviors of autonomy enabling numerous potential expeditionary autonomous systems; artificial intelligence enabling future Intelligence systems; optics, electronics, and photonics research to enable revolutionary spectral awareness in small low power sensors; computer and network science to enable expeditionary computing coupled with Data Science research to conduct data analysis; fundamental chemistry and materials science research to advance technologies to support sustainment; basic materials research to explore and improve armor and structural materials; electrochemical energy conversion and storage research to sustain the force; chemistry and physics to provide disruptive energetics for expeditionary Fires; and biology, physiology, and cognitive sciences addressing the Naval Expeditionary warfighters human abilities.\n\nThe program also seeks to establish and nurture a multidisciplinary Science and Technology community of Government, academic and industry researchers to accelerate the transition of new science and technology into fielded systems.\nAccomplishments and plans described below are examples for each effort category."

Agents (cyber or physical) do not yet have the level of intelligence needed to operate in such open, uncertain and unpredictable environments either independently or alongside warfighters. In the area of Intelligence for Autonomous Agents, basic research includes the development of principles for machine intelligence, efficient computational methods, algorithms and tools for building versatile smart agents that can perform missions autonomously with minimal human supervision and collaborate seamlessly with teams of warfighters and other agents. In the area of Image Understanding, basic research includes the development of theory and algorithms for understanding surveillance imagery, for semantic search of visual datasets, and for autonomous agent perception. The main focus is on reconstructing 3D scenes, recognizing object classes and specific objects, recognizing activities and events, inferring intentions, as well as succinct natural language descriptions of images and video.\n\nApplied and Computational Analysis Program\n\nConduct basic research in modern and classical mathematical analysis with emphasis on mathematical and computational models of physical phenomena. Naval interest in waves, flows, materials, structures, and information processing motivates research in the areas of multi-phase, multi-physics, including analytically rigorous and computationally robust and efficient modeling of fatigue, fracture, dislocation, nucleation, shocks and contact lines; dynamical systems, and oceanic and atmospheric modeling, including fluid transport, mixing, and predictability of models for nonlinear dynamics; and inverse problems arising from acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering.\n\nCyber Security and Complex Software Systems\n\nConduct basic research in computing systems and complex software systems that meet required assurances for security, safety, reliability and performance to measurably improve the information-processing challenges of future naval systems.  Cyber Security sub-program investigates and develops wide-ranging principles and techniques for continuously maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information infrastructures, focusing on the software, the hardware and the network. The program seeks to establish an autonomic, secure and dependable informational infrastructure toward achieving Information Dominance. Complex Software sub-program investigates principles, algorithms and methods, and develops software engineering tools for achieving efficient, timely, robust and secure software executables, focusing on science for software construction, correctness and efficiency by revisiting software development and deployment methodology. Efficient, timely, robust and secure software is a requirement for secure information infrastructure toward achieving Information Dominance.\n\nNetworked Sensing\n\nConduct basic research in optical components and infrared technologies including lasers and focal plane arrays using narrow bandgap semiconductors for the purpose of imaging through clouds, fog, haze and dust; persistent surveillance for severely size constrained airborne applications; detecting anomalies and targets; and autonomous sensing for UAV platforms and networked sensing over multiple sensors and\/or sensor platforms.\n\nMathematical Optimization and Operations Research\n\nConduct basic research in mathematical optimization. The primary focus of the program's basic-research portion is linear, nonlinear, integer and combinatorial optimization. Theoretical development, algorithm design and analysis, computational techniques, and software prototypes for solving large-scale problems are of interest. Techniques that produce provably optimal or near-optimal solutions, as well as techniques applicable to large problem domains are favored.  This includes, but is not limited to, cutting-plane and polyhedral techniques for mixed-integer programming and interior-point and first- order algorithms for conic\/convex optimization. Decentralized optimization is an area of growing interest, as are innovative techniques for dealing with uncertainty, such as stochastic, robust, and online optimization.\n\nInformation Technology \n\nTo address the continued need for improving the operational capability of Naval information and communication systems in the areas of: high assurance software; secure tactical connectivity; intelligent autonomy; and the processing, integration, and presentation of information. The expected payoff is: the development of improved methods for producing, analyzing, and securing Naval software systems; new design concepts for future Naval tactical communication systems and networks; intelligent autonomy and improved interaction with autonomous systems; and improved methods for analyzing, integrating, and presenting information to users. Specific research examples include security for systems that employ Systems-on-a Chip Integrated Processor architectures, AI systems that understand causal reasoning, robotic systems that take advantage of emerging neuromorphic processors, new algorithms for performing data analytics, and networks that take into account the age of the information on the network for routing decisions."

However, the composition and properties of the AM alloy can change significantly during deposition, requiring new alloy development efforts to determine the initial composition that will produce the intended composition and properties in the AM-fabricated component.  This effort will begin to address the need by designing, developing and optimizing new metallic alloy compositions for AM that are resistant to the effects of the Naval\/maritime environment.\n\nMaterials and Chemistry\n\nDesigning advanced materials depends on novel synthesis, processing, characterization, and performance. This effort addresses all materials including metals, alloys, ceramics, composites, semiconducting and superconducting material and bimolecular materials.  Some examples of ongoing studies are (1) uncovering the physical, chemical, optical and biological phenomena in the nanometer scale, (2) understanding the effect of coatings on the conductions of ions and electrons, (3) developing better understanding on the performance of spin-polarized electrons for advanced electronic switches and memories, (4) developing fundamental understanding of electron transfer and carbon fixation pathways in microbial consortia and relate them to energy harvesting, material synthesis ans sensing, (5) understanding the mechanism of bioactuation for novel would healing applications, biocatalysis for mitigation and sensing, biocorrosion\/fouling for improving operational efficiency and reducing operational maintanace cost, (6) computational capabilities to understand the microstructures\/defects in metals and alloys of Naval interest, computational fluid dymnamics simulations for jet engine noise reduction, flapping wing design to hypersonics. Several accomplishments have been demonstrated for materials using 3D printing, mobility of electrons of one spin, design of microbial cells to extract power from the coastal ocean sediments.\n\nUndersea Warfare  \n\nLaboratory and theoretical\/numerical studies focused on creating new techniques for understanding, predicting, and controlling the interactions between acoustic and elastic waves such as:  underwater coupling architectures that achieve a broad range of acoustic impedances; and the creation of high efficiency silicon based thin film thermoelectric modules for undersea warfare applications by exploiting nanocrystallization, multilayering to control thermal conductivity."

The effort encompasses research over a wide variety of regions, including the open ocean, Arctic, and littorals, and addresses scientific issues relevant to Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) including acoustic propagation and the impact of acoustics on marine mammal behavior. The improved understanding of the ocean environment enables the development of fully coupled (ocean-atmosphere-wave-ice) global, regional and local predictive models that can be used for operational planning at tactical, strategic and climate scales. The program is strongly aligned with the Oceanographer of the Navy and the research topics addressed by this sub activity reflects the priorities for improved forecasts of the operational environment and the development and use of autonomous systems for the collection of environmental observations and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable science at sea. Research performed under this Sub Activity includes efforts in the following areas: littoral geosciences and optics, marine mammals and biology, physical oceanography and prediction, and ocean acoustics. Accomplishments and plans described below are representative highlights from these efforts. This Program requires field research that involves participation in Navy environmental planning efforts including environmental planning documents (Environmental Impact Statements). The use of active acoustic transmissions requires modeling of the acoustic effects of sound on marine life."

Initiate development of methodologies and\/or observing technologies which are: a) nimble, cost-effective, rapidly re-locatable, or will offer bold insight into littoral dynamics, or b) utilize sensors on operational platforms (termed organic) in ways which increase battlespace awareness or can be used to map the maritime domain while idle. Initiate studies and modeling of shelf, near-shore, delta, estuarine, and riverine dynamics, including surface and internal waves, currents, stratification, sediment transport and the seabed response and coastal winds driving shallow water response. Understanding shallow water features which will affect acoustic propagation or acoustic system performance and\/or events which cause swimmer or navigational hazards (bathymetry-wave-current-wind interactions), navigationally significant bathymetry or trafficability changes, are of particular interest. Initiate studies using remote sensing of the coastal and riverine environment, above and below the sea surface and canopy, e.g., from EO, IR, radar, SAR, inSAR and acoustic, from land or ship-based, unmanned vehicles, airplanes or satellites. New remote sensing tools and algorithms that can be used to initialize forecast models in distant, remote and\/or denied areas are of particular interest.  Initiate studies of optical processes in the littoral environment, including the atmosphere, sea surface, water column, sea bed and suspended or dissolved materials. Predicting the timing (initiation, transport and clearance) of materials that negatively affect optical clarity, is of particular interest.\n\nExtramural Marine Mammals and Biology\n\nIntegrated Ecosystem Research - Conduct basic research to understand the patterns and causes of variability in the distribution and abundance of marine mammals over space and time. Initiate a multidisciplinary approach using tagging, visual surveys, and passive acoustics to collect baseline measures of marine mammal behaviors and distributions relative to environmental features and marine mammal prey fields. Investigate using animal tagging and passive acoustic monitoring to study behaviors and distributions of marine mammals relative to key environmental properties (biotic and abiotic).  This includes providing a context for interpreting behavioral responses to external stimuli (i.e. anthropogenic sound), and providing basic knowledge needed for predictive models of species of concern.\n\nEffects of Sound - Conduct basic research on behavioral, physiological (hearing and stress response), and potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Initiate research to characterize the causal chain of events leading from sound exposure to \"biologically significant\" behavioral reactions that might increase risks of population-level effects and\/or the potential for stranding. An additional focus is to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Conduct research into the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Initiate research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and\/or bodies.  Another research focus is better understand the stress response in marine mammals to sound exposure. Conduct research to develop an understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize the relationships among hormones or other biomarkers in different matrices, define and compare the quantitative and temporal relationships of hormones across the different matrices, and evaluate and characterize the relationship between the physiological stress response in marine mammals and acoustic exposure and 'biologically significant' disturbance. Continue research to develop statistical models of the population consequences of acoustic disturbance to be fitted to data from marine mammal populations and lead collaborative development of transferable models of the effects of disturbance on marine mammals.\n\nMonitoring and Detection - Conduct research to develop and test new and existing technology to detect and classify marine mammals in the marine environment and during periods of low light such as passive acoustics, and IR.

Emphasis is on improved measurements, laboratory and model based experiments to quantify and understand important oceanographic processes that lead to the development of ocean dynamic models from global to submesoscale scales, and to couple these oceanographic models with atmospheric, ice, biological, sediment response, and optical models. Surveillance of coastal land areas and waters is important to support Navy operations and difficult. The Navy\/Marine Corps needs include an improved use of overhead (airborne and satellite) active and passive microwave sensors, overhead optical sensors, surface-based (ships and ground-based) grazing angle microwave sensors. To predict bottom boundary physical, geological, geochemical, geoacoustic and geotechnical properties in shallow-water operating areas requires:  a) an improved understanding of processes that generate and modify the shape, structure and physical properties of the seafloor, subseafloor, ocean water column and ice-cover and topography\/morphology;  b) use of rapid, airborne characterization of littoral environments including time-varying coastal topography, littoral bathymetry, sea-level height, land and seafloor sedimentary structures to explain\/predict the observed changes; c) remote sensing of bulk properties of Arctic sea-ice over broad two-dimensional areas that previously could be sampled only at spot locations by in-situ sampling; and d) quantification of the influence of turbulence generated at the seafloor boundary layer on vertical mixing and stratification in shallow water outside the surf zone."

Conduct studies using remote sensing of the coastal and riverine environment, above and below the sea surface and canopy, using electro-optic (EO), infrared (IR), radar, synthetic aperture radar (SAR),interferometric SAR (inSAR) and acoustic, from land or ship-based, unmanned vehicles, airplanes or satellites (Undersea Remote Sensing DRI). Develop new remote sensing tools and algorithms that can be used to initialize forecast models in distant, remote and\/or denied areas. Conduct modeling and field studies of storm processes affecting the littoral environment, including the atmosphere, sea surface, water column, sea bed and suspended or dissolved materials. Predicting the initiation, transport and\/or erosion of materials in response to storm events that create navigationally significant bathymetry or traffic-ability changes and\/or changes in optical clarity.\n\nMarine Mammals and Biology \n\nAreas of research include monitoring and detection, integrated ecosystem, and effects of sound on marine mammals. Conduct basic research to develop and test new and existing technology to detect, classify, localize and potentially track marine mammals in the marine environment, which are used to develop density and abundance estimates of marine mammals as a required input for all Navy sound effects modeling done under mandate of the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and National Environmental Policy Act. Conduct multidisciplinary studies including tagging, visual surveys, and passive acoustics to collect baseline measures of marine mammal behaviors and distributions relative to environmental features and marine mammal prey fields. These baseline measures provide a context for interpreting responses to naval acoustic sources. Also, continue research on the effects of sound include behavioral, physiological (hearing and stress response), and population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Conduct research to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Conduct research using increase in funds to characterize and quantify the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on marine mammal populations. Conduct research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales).\n\nEffects of Sound \n\nResearch on behavioral, physiological (hearing and stress response), and potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Research to characterize the causal chain of events leading from sound exposure to biologically significant behavioral reactions that might increase risks of population-level effects and\/or the potential for stranding. An additional focus is to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Research the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Initiate research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and\/or bodies. Another research focus is to better understand the stress response in marine mammals to sound exposure. Research on understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize the relationships among hormones or other biomarkers in different matrices, define and compare the quantitative and temporal relationships of hormones across the different matrices, and evaluate and characterize the relationship between the physiological stress response in marine mammals and acoustic exposure and biologically significant disturbance. Research to develop statistical models of the population consequences of acoustic disturbance to be fitted to data from marine mammal populations and lead collaborative development of transferable models of the effects of disturbance on marine mammals.\n\nMonitoring and Detection\n\nResearch to develop and test new and existing technology to detect and classify marine mammals in the marine environment and during periods of low light such as passive acoustics, and infrared (IR). Research and development of passive acoustic signal processing algorithms for detection, classification, and localization of marine mammals. Continue the development and testing of autonomous hardware platforms using passive acoustics and\/or IR to detect and classify marine mammals using a variety of fixed, towed, floating, and profiling platforms. \n\nArctic sciences \n\nResearch to improve the understanding of physical processes in the Arctic environment that impact current and projected Naval operations. Efforts include research to characterize the behavior of sea ice, including melt and reformation, ice rheology and motion, and interactions with ocean stratification, surface waves, and the atmosphere. The research program includes development of Arctic System models and data assimilation techniques for improved prediction, exploration and development of new sensors and unmanned platforms to collect observations of the Arctic environment, and the research into new algorithms to characterize sea ice from space-based remote sensing. An effort to better understand processes controlling the stratification of the Arctic Ocean will conclude this year. \n\nOcean Acoustics \n\nExpand research to understand propagation and scattering of acoustic energy in a wide range of ocean environments. New emphasis will be placed on the information content contained in underwater acoustic signals for use in machine learning\/big-data analytics. Areas of research include shallow-water scattering mechanisms related to reverberation and clutter; seabed acoustic measurements supporting geo-acoustic inversion; acoustic propagation through internal waves and coastal ocean processes and the development of unified ocean\/seabed\/acoustic models, including scattering from rough surfaces, biologics and bubbles; and penetration\/propagation within the porous seafloor. In deep water research will include the effects of environmental variability induced by ocean internal waves, internal tides and mesoscale processes, and by bathymetric features including seamounts and ridges, on the stability, statistics, spatial distribution, and predictability of broadband acoustic signals. Also of interest is the coherence and depth dependence of deep-water ambient noise. An increasing emphasis will be placed on understanding the effects of Arctic conditions on acoustic propagation and ambient noise, particularly in under-ice environments, as facilitated by a basin wide data collection effort scheduled to begin in FY 2020.\n\nBattlespace Environments \n\nThe overall objective of this research is to improve basic understanding of physical, seafloor and biological oceanographic processes on space and time scales of naval interest. The work includes studies of aspects of ocean\ncirculation (fronts, eddies and turbulence), thermodynamics (mixing and acoustic impacts), waves (including their impact on sea ice and rogue waves), sea ice (including land fast ice) as well as ocean boundary layer processes.\nEmphasis is on improved measurements, laboratory and model based experiments to quantify and understand important oceanographic processes that lead to the development of ocean dynamic\/thermodynamic models from global to submesoscale\nscales, and to couple these oceanographic models with atmospheric, ice, biological, sediment response, and optical models. Surveillance of coastal land areas and waters is important to support Navy operations, so the research\nfoci include an improved use of overhead (airborne and satellite) active and passive microwave sensors, overhead optical sensors, surface-based (ships and ground-based) grazing angle microwave sensors. To predict bottom boundary\nphysical, geological, geochemical, geoacoustic and geotechnical properties in shallow-water operating areas requires: a) an improved understanding of processes that generate and modify the shape, structure and physical properties of the seafloor, subsea floor, ocean water column and ice-cover and topography\/morphology; b) use of rapid, airborne characterization of littoral environments including time-varying coastal topography, littoral bathymetry, sea-level height, land and seafloor sedimentary structures to explain\/predict the observed changes; c) remote sensing of bulk properties of Arctic sea-ice over broad two-dimensional areas that previously could be sampled only at spot\nlocations by in-situ sampling; and d) quantification of the influence of turbulence generated at the seafloor boundary layer on vertical mixing and stratification in shallow water outside the surf zone."

It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment. Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia\/industry team. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on directed energy, high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic\/infrared (EO\/IR) sensor technologies. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and\/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. \n\nThe metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational\/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments\/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational\/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass\/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development\/demonstration program."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nThis PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This element also includes the National Naval Responsibility in Naval Engineering (NNR-NE).  The NNR-NE supports early applied research in the areas of propulsion, platform structures, hydrodynamics, automation control and system engineering, design tools, naval power systems and ensuring a strong and healthy academic infrastructure.  Specific research themes are:\n\nAdvanced Naval Power Systems Technology:\nEfforts address electrical and auxiliary system and component technology to dramatically improve energy and power density, operating efficiency, and recoverability from casualties. A major investment focus is providing the power and energy required for directed energy weapons on current and future surface combatants. Advanced Naval Power efforts include: developing technologies for high-power, cyber-secured energy networks, distribution and control of power, providing warfighting capability with more energy efficient systems; mitigate adverse impacts of alternative fuel on Naval platforms and equipment; and utilizing the Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC) efforts to develop modeling and simulation tools to provide critical design and operational capabilities for the all-electric ship program, accelerate development and demonstration of technologies, reduce risk of new technology insertion, and address the national shortage of electrical power engineers. \n\nDevelop new machinery integration concepts. Develop simulation based Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) methods and technologies.  Contribute to system reconfiguration.  Design a ship electrical system architecture based on a main bus that distributes \"rough\" Direct Current (DC) power throughout the ship at nominally 10 KV.  Development of macro- and atomic-scale multi-physics models is being pursued to enhance understanding of materials processing and performance, energy conversion mechanisms, cyber-physical energy concepts, and power management.  System-level studies focus on the scalability and reliability of component technologies.  Another thrust is the development of tools to model heat transfer at multiple length scales allowing for simulation of heat flow through the ship in order to evaluate the impact of power conversion electronics, sensors, and weapons on the overall thermal balance of the vessel.\n\nAdvanced Sea Platform Technology:\nHydrodynamics: Critical platform design for surface ships hydrodynamics that is focused on the theory, computation, and lab and at-sea experimentation to develop understanding and prediction capabilities for all hydrodynamic phenomena associated with surface ships and small craft, their effects on vessel performance, and concepts for modification.  Propulsor hydrodynamics is focused on understanding the physics of flow around propulsors and their interactions to improve propulsor performance, mobility, efficiency, and affordability, as well as prediction and control of various types of cavitation on propulsors and appendages. This also includes predictive capability of cavitation inception, thrust breakdown, and erosion phenomenon and scaling laws. Technology efforts in the area of Subsurface Hydrodynamics include identifying, understanding, predicting, and controlling flow physics, as well as turbulence and stratified wakes.  This is further applied to Subsurface Maneuvering Technologies, and understanding the Dynamics of Interacting Platforms. Additionally hydrodynamic technologies focused on the signature aspects of the hull-propulsor interaction and maneuvering.\n\nPlatform Structures: Focused on time-varying, structural reliability analysis and prediction for a ship structural system with uncertainty quantification and propagation. Specific topics include novel structural configurations across composite and metallic materials and prediction methods for advanced global hull strength, local panel and component strength, fatigue and fracture strength, and seaway loads and load effects for high-speed\/high-performance ships and vessels.  Hull life assurance addresses development of new structural system approaches for surface ships and submarines, including the management of weapons effects to control structural damage and the improvement of structural materials.\n\nUnmanned Surface Vehicles (USV): Autonomy for USVs and related mission functions aligned with Naval S&T strategic focus on autonomy and unmanned vehicles.

Research efforts are carefully selected to ensure they have the potential to expand warfighting capabilities, inform operational concepts and requirements development, and advance state of the art technology and scientific knowledge.  Current guidance also highlights the need to accelerate our pace of development and guide the approach to rapid experimentation, prototyping, and learning.\n\nAs reflected in the Marine Corps Operating Concept, the current strategic guidance from the Commandant, Expeditionary Forces will conduct maneuver warfare in environments characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information used as a weapon, a battle of signatures, and an increasingly contested maritime domain. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. \n\nThese future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting Size, Weight, Power, Post limitations, and information availability within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. \n\nThe approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both \"push\" and \"pull\" aspects of technology projects. Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyber attacks.\n\nTechnologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to Size, Weight, Power, Cost constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment."

The objective of the work in this Program Element (PE) is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0602750N Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research, where the Navy's participation in the FNC Program is funded.  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, are being resourced in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD).  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in this PE.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces. \n\nPrior to FY19, the underlying FNC Program investments in this PE were aligned to specific FNC projects.  In order to increase agility, exploit technology advances, and respond quickly to naval needs, future applied research investments supporting FNC technology candidates are being developed in a more flexible manner. This approach facilitates an optimum response when developing and maturing the technology options that will be developed further in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD). The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Investments are organized to enhance collaboration with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors.  \n\nA complete accounting of the technologies being developed in this PE will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&T investments. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These platforms are often Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum, harsh Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and RF challenged environments.  \n\nThe current specific objectives are:\n\n- Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic\/infra-red (EO\/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.\n\n- Tactical Networking and Network Control\/Management: \nDevelop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill."

It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for Consultation, Command and Control (C3) information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.

This is accomplished by establishing quality, relevant connections between the international research and development community, Naval fleet\/forces, DOD, other US Government agencies and international partners.\n\nScience Advisors (SA):  This effort ensures that the operational Naval fleet\/force help shape the DON investment in science and technology (S&T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly prototype, experiment, demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for Naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. The SA Program also informs capability-based war games using current and future technology to identify future capability strengths and shortfalls that assist in shaping the DON investment strategy. The ONR Global SA Program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the Naval Research & Development Enterprise, and strategic development commands. \n \nINTERNATIONAL SCIENCE: The ONR Global mission is also accomplished through PhD-level scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America, providing coverage in these regions as well as Africa, Australia\/New Zealand and the Middle East. ONR Global scientists actively search the globe for emerging scientific research and promising technologies, collaborating with international organizations and researchers through liaison visits and grants in innovative applied research. The direct impact of this investment is to leverage international research during increasingly dynamic global interdependence and improve the ability to solve DON S&T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners. In addition, this investment builds global S&T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners. \n\nINTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT: ONR Global also supports international engagement with partner nations through the development and maintenance of bilateral and multilateral relationships, international agreements, and other activities that promote RDT&E collaboration and interoperability."

Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive Countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats. The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area. This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies. Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept. The current objectives are: \n\n- EW Radio Frequency (RF) Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the RF spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive\/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. \n\n- EW Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the EO\/IR spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming\/steering, and signal processing and transmission. \n\n- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack. \n\n- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies: Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. \n\n- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command & Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance. EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group."

Specific areas of research include: novel optical architectures for affordable persistent surveillance to support search, detection, classification, identification and targeting functions; development of laser and passive mmW detectors for imaging through degraded visual environments (e.g., clouds, fog, haze and dust); low size, weight, and power hyper-spectral sensors for severely size and power constrained airborne applications; development of automatic algorithms for autonomously detecting and recognizing anomalies and targets using networked sensors and\/or sensor platforms; novel techniques for Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) countermeasures to detect, track and\/or jam sensors.\n\nElectronics:  Create and explore new concepts, components, techniques, and subsystems for the generation, and transmission of Ultra-Violet (UV), visible, and infrared radiation to support current and future Navy and DoD needs.\n\nElectromagnetic Warfare: Work is ongoing to address the critical deficiency with respect to operations in brownout conditions.  IR and terahertz technologies are being modified and integrated with the expectations that combining these two technologies an effective solution can be obtained.  Bistatic radar and imaging technology is being developed to extend surveillance capabilities and passively engage targets.  A unique approach permitting rapid active scanning of a battlefield in the IR domain using a non-mechanically scanned mechanism is under development.  This technology if successful will eliminate the multiple laser ball systems currently required to accomplish this same requirement at lower Size, Weight and Power (SWAP).  Active work is also being focused on developing capabilities for high resolution, wide field of view sensors on modest sized Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) platforms. \n\nMaterials and Chemistry: Advanced fabrication methods to develop micro-retro-reflectors operating in short wavelength IR systems.  This study is directed to develop unique spectral bar codes. Major accomplishments include development of high refractive index glass composition."

An important subclass are the Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), Microwave (MW), and Millimeter Wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems. Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems. These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials. Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and Submillimeter Wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 Gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz). The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size. Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. This activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems."

The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.\n\nThe current specific objectives are:\n\n- High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.\n\n- Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.\n\n- Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nThis PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. \n\nThis PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space & Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the \"key transformational capabilities\" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed\nat understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.\n\nMajor efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the Battlespace Environment (BSE), determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems, and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations, maintenance, repair and upgrades that enable applied research at sea and provides modeling and analysis for environmental compliance for ONR\/NRL field work and active acoustic experiments. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.\n\nJoint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)\/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE."

The research emphasizes technologies leading to non-platform-based systems through novel power sources and power-harvesting.  For example, benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs) are prototype power supplies that generate power from the oxidation of sedimentary organic matter and are intended for marine deployed sensor systems presently powered by batteries.  BMFCs can provide power for long-term, uninterrupted operation of Anti-Submarine Warfare; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; and scientific systems otherwise limited in operational lifetime by battery depletion.\n\nBattlespace Environments \nContinue to conceptualize and perform laboratory, field, and numerical modeling studies to understand and exploit various geoscience and optical environmental phenomena in areas that are scientifically challenging, require innovation, and are of interest to the Navy\/Marine Corps. Encompasses the design, performance, analysis and underlying theory of field and laboratory experiments designed to understand geological\/geophysical, biological, and optical phenomena in the oceans and littoral zones, and to validate that understanding. Continuing developing new or enhance existing shipboard, in-situ, airborne, and spaceborne sensors and appropriate inversion and though-the-sensor techniques to obtain, store, utilize, merge and\/or exploit data and create operationally and tactically useful environmental information of the littorals and bottom.

This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The littoral zone has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.\n\nThis Activity will also focuses on efforts addressing research needs identified by Task Force Ocean that will enable tactical maneuver for the future submarine force. The efforts funded by this Program Element (PE) fall generally into two topic areas: Analysis and understanding of the impact of environmental conditions on Large Vertical Aperture (LVA) Array sonar data, and the development of reduced order ocean-acoustic models to enable environmental awareness and prediction on forward platforms."

This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement\/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve Anti-Submarine Warfare, Naval Special Warfare, and Mine and Expeditionary Warfare.\n\nThis Program requires field research that involves participation in Navy Environmental planning efforts including environmental planning documents (Environmental Impact Statements). The use of active acoustic transmissions requires\nmodeling of the acoustic effects of sound on marine life."

                        "val": "The DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the FY96 National Defense Authorization Act. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP). The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S) serves as the OSD Principal Staff Assistant and oversees, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DoD NLW Executive Agent.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the requirements and capabilities sought by the Services and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the most relevant non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment. These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objective of strategic competition by providing options to the joint force in pursuit of national objectives in legal or policy constrained scenarios, as well as complementing the use of lethal effects in complex combat scenarios, for example, in urban environments with large civilian populations. Ongoing NLW studies, analyses and exercise efforts with NATO and Allies also support NDS objectives to strengthen alliances and partnerships. Resulting capabilities facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for below lethal threshold engagements.\n\nThis program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric incapacitation, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Some examples of counter-personnel research include optimizing known NLW effectiveness and discovery of new human target behavioral effects which mitigate these Joint Requirements Oversight Counsel-approved joint non-lethal effects capability-gaps.  Other examples are the assessment and study of new NLW technologies related to: (1) increasing the range of current NLWs; (2) increasing their duration of effect; and (3) increasing the volume of fire associated with NLWs.  This includes developing longer range, more compact: (1) NL sound and light devices; (2) smaller, lighter, and more power efficient high power microwave systems; and (3) developing new non-lethal laser induced plasma weapons for long range counter-personnel and counter-materiel applications.  The objective is to further reduce non-lethal directed energy weapon system size, weight, power consumption, thermal cooling requirements and overall system cost while increasing counter-personnel and counter-materiel capabilities.  Continue applied research to characterize new non-lethal phenomena and assess new target human effects and weapon effectiveness, including development of dose response and injury correlates for new NLW technologies.  Continue concept exploration of novel NLW capabilities for integration into future escalation of force platforms.  Transition results to higher levels of technology development and demonstration as feasibility is determined."

Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element , as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea.\n\nThe activities described in this program element PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments."

Research performed within Undersea Weaponry supports several Naval S&T Focus Areas including Power Projection & Integrated Defense, Assure Access to Maritime Battlespace, Autonomy & Unmanned Systems, and Power & Energy. Weapon technology focus areas include: Explosives and Warheads, Guidance and Control (G&C), Simulation Based Design, Propulsion, Power Sources, Supercavitation, and Counter Weapons\/Counter Measures. The ultimate goal of this activity is to provide revolutionary capabilities needed to fill Sea Shield and Sea Strike Warfighter Capability Gaps, to accommodate unique payload limitations through the development of modular and reduced sized undersea weapons based on common technology enablers (where possible), to provide improved platform pre-engagement positioning and fire-control solutions for effective weapon-to-target engagement, and provide countermeasures and counterweapons against current and next-generation undersea weapons."

The objective of the work in this PE is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Navy and Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  The FNC Program was restructured for FY 2019 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development.  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in this PE.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is working closely across the Department of the Navy (DON) and Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three \"key transformational capabilities\" required by \"Sea Shield\" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within \"Sea Strike\" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric\/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection\/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization\/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.\n\nThe activities described in this program element PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These investments represent game-changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.  INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities.  The projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future.  The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to support further development.  These investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nDeveloping INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements.  The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs.  These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts.\n\nDue to the nature of these projects, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs as existing ones are completed.  Successful experiments and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities, requiring significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  INPs have been collectively grouped into R-2 Activities that include Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy\/Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber, Undersea Warfare and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nDue to the nature of these projects, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.

This project develops cyber sensors and automated vulnerability assessment cyber tools that deliver comprehensive defense-in-depth cyber capabilities to monitor, detect, mitigate, and recover from cyber threats in near real-time.  This project will develop software based capabilities and a compact and affordable computing appliance applicable to any aircraft, surface vessel, submarine or ground vehicle.  The technical development will leverage dynamic and active sensing and cyber vulnerability prevention science and technology approaches, including formal methods, model checking, and static\/dynamic analyses which reduce cyber platform attack surfaces, prevent the exploitation of system vulnerabilities, shorten detection timelines, and perform other mitigation functions.  Commercial off-the-shelf software components will be leveraged to develop technology for de-bloating and delayering so as to reduce the attack surface and ensure platform resiliency against unauthorized cyber intrusions."

EMRG will bring new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, the EM Railgun provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air & surface warfare, and naval surface fire support.\n\nEMRG is a multi-year effort in various stages of research and development within with the Navy's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) family of RDT&E programs. INP investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6.  It is intended that prototypes developed within this program, requiring both Budget Activity 2 (BA2) and Budget Activity 3 (BA3) funding, are demonstrated in a relevant environment to prove the feasibility of the new technological capability.  Successful experiments and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities, requiring significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  The Activity identified in Project Unit 2481 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development INP effort. \n\nDue to the nature of these projects, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nThis PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nActivities and efforts in this PE address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Research efforts are carefully selected to ensure they have the potential to expand warfighting capabilities, inform operational concepts and requirements development, and advance state of the art technology and scientific knowledge.  Current guidance also highlights the need to accelerate our pace of development and guide the approach to rapid experimentation, prototyping, and learning.\n\nAs reflected in the Marine Corps Operating Concept, the current strategic guidance from the Commandant, expeditionary forces will conduct maneuver warfare in environments characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information used as a weapon, a battle of signatures, and an increasingly contested maritime domain. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. \n\nThese future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting Size, Weight, Power, Cost limitations, and information availability within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. \n\nThe approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both \"push\" and \"pull\" aspects of technology projects.  This PE matures technologies emerging from PE 0602131M-Marine Corps Landing Force Technology to develop concept prototypes and initial experimentation to confirm feasibility in an environment relavent to operations. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Research supports both networked and local computation for communications that exploits the expeditionary forces close physical proximity to threats while mitigating shortfalls commiserate within Distributed, Intermittent, and Limited environments. Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyberattacks.\n\nTechnologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to Size, Weight, Power, Cost constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.\n\nFurther, this activity integrates and demonstrates enhanced communications and situational awareness capabilities in experimental and warfighting environments reflecting USMC operations. Advanced technology resources will be developed and applied to complement commercial, other service, and defense agency investments to produce a technology base addressing identified Marine Corps technology gaps.  Focus will be on developing component level prototypes and experimentation in relevant environments."

The objective of the work in this PE is to develop promising technologies emerging from the FNC technology candidates funded in PE 0602131M that have been matured to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0603673N.  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects, where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in this PE.  Funding for FNC technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in PE 0602131M.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces. \n\nPrior to FY19, FNC Program investments were selected almost two years in advance of execution.  It was determined by Navy and Marine Corps leadership that this approach limits DON's ability to exploit technology advances and respond quickly to naval needs.  As a result, future BA 3 investments supporting the FNC Program are now made less than one year before commencing execution. Because FNCs are now starting at higher TRLs, the typical duration of an FNC has been shortened to 3-years.  The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Individual R-2 Activities have been discontinued and investments are organized to enhance collaboration with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors. A complete accounting of the technologies being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

This includes efficient and responsive force sustainment, planning and directing logistics operations, logistics demand reduction, fleet maintenance, and expeditionary energy.  Expeditionary Energy enhances combat capability of expeditionary warfighters by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of energy production, storage, distribution and use. Beyond traditional energy efforts, this portfolio also looks at other issues, including energy-efficient behaviors and hybridization of energy sources.

DC, CD&I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for Science and Technology (S&T).  MCWL's Commanding General (CG) is the DC, CD&I designated Proponent of USMC S&T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&T.  The MCWL\/FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.  \n\nThe current MCWL\/FD Campaign Plan addresses how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) called for in the Secretary of the Navy's \"Cooperative Strategy 21\" and the Marine Corps' capstone Marine Operating Concept (MOC), according to the objectives of the Commandant of the Marine Corps' guidance to develop the future Marine Corps Force 2025.  Execution of the MCWL\/FD Campaign Plan results in recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  In support of the Marine Corps' role to provide an ever-ready quick strike force to protect US interests, MCWL\/FD pursues concepts and new capabilities focused on the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The MAGTF is the Marine Corps' doctrinal, task organized, force deployment package.  It consists of four elements: the Command Element that provides overarching Command and Control  of the entire force; the Ground Combat Element normally built around a core infantry unit with supporting armor, artillery, and other ground units; the Aviation Combat Element which provides aircraft, air defense, and other aviation functions; and the Logistics Combat Element which consists of Combat Service Support  elements including medical, supply, and transportation.  Marine Corps Force 2025 also seeks to maximize the employment of electronic, information, and cyber warfare, as well as manned\/unmanned teaming, within each element of the MAGTF.  MCWL\/FD also examines future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment.  MCWL\/FD accomplishes its mission through five subordinate Divisions:  \n\nFutures Assessment Division's mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks. \n\nThe mission of Concepts and Plans Division is to:  examine select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges, and Naval warfare and joint\/coalition integration and capabilities, in order to develop Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS to promote development of the emergent Marine Corps force.  CAP is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.\n\nWargaming Division conducts formal wargames to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and identify opportunities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities. \n\nExperiment Division conducts live force concept-based experimentation to facilitate exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  \n\nScience and Technology (S&T) Division conducts investigations and assessments to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL\/FD investigates the relevance to MOC-prescribed capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following Thrust Areas:  Command, Control, Communications, and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Autonomy and Robotics; MAGTF Fires; Maneuver; Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy); Expeditionary Medicine; Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW); and Force Protection. \n\nThis project is organized into 6 activities, the core of which are represented by the Warfighting Capability Areas of the MAGTF.  The project emphasizes development and demonstration of advanced technology capability concepts, and the examination of their operational application and military utility in the context of live-force field experimentation with Marines.  This operational experimentation directly supports Marine Corps combat development to inform future capability requirements and optimize the acquisition process."

The ACERM technology enhances the mission effectiveness of USMC infantry forces through a significant increase in maximum range, while providing a first round on target capability against both stationary and moving targets while minimizing the relative increase in unit cost.  In addition, the development of a Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition (CDAEM) payload will be developed for the 155mm Moving Target Artillery Round (MTAR).  The capability will greatly enhance the USMC's ability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize, and\/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area when there is a lack of precise target location, as is often the case with moving forces, counter fire missions, or when threat forces employ battlefield obscurants.\n\nMCWL\/FD is sponsoring experiments to determine the military utility of small tactical autonomous unmanned ground vehicle systems to support logistics, fires and maneuver.  Funds support the development and demonstration of tactical ground robotic vehicle systems as well as autonomy and perception algorithms utilizing a common ground control system.  The capability will greatly enhance the tactical effectiveness, survivability, and lethality of tactical infantry formations in close combat operating environments."

                        "val": "The DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the FY96 National Defense Authorization Act. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Commandant of the\nMarine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP). The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S) serves as the OSD Principal Staff Assistant and oversees, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DoD NLW Executive Agent.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product\nTeam, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the requirements and capabilities sought by the Services and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the most relevant non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objective of strategic competition by providing options to the joint force in pursuit of national objectives in legal or policy constrained scenarios, as well as complementing the use of lethal effects in complex combat scenarios, for example, in urban environments with large civilian populations. Ongoing NLW studies, analyses and exercise efforts with NATO and Allies also support NDS objectives to strengthen alliances and partnerships. Resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for below lethal threshold engagements.\n\nThis program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities. Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and\/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the FNC Program.  The objective of the work in this PE is to develop promising technologies emerging from the FNC Applied Research program that have successfully matured to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  \n\nThe FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects, where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, are being resourced in this PE, 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development.  ONR is coordinating closely with the resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

As a result, future Budget Activity (BA) 3 investments supporting the FNC Program are now made less than one year before commencing execution.  Because FNCs are now starting at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), the typical duration of an FNC has been shortened to 3-years.  The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Program Element R-2 Activities were modified for FY19 to align to warfare areas and the corresponding resource sponsors that will integrate FNC technologies into acquisition programs of record.  These R-2 Activities have been continued into FY20.  \n\nA complete accounting of the technologies being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

Training simulator software and hardware to support the rapid integration and interoperability of air and ground legacy and future simulation-based training is being developed to address the shortfall in sorties needed to maintain readiness for integrated air and ground operations of the marine air-ground task force.  This technology will allow pilots and aircrews to train effectively in a common, simulated operating environment. Flexible and interoperable learning continuum and performance aids will be developed, providing individual career management, skill classification, selection, automatic training content re-engineering, supervisor evaluations, and Fleet readiness tracking.  New machine learning algorithms will input training data from the lifelong learning record, and output a training model that is usable for adaptive training. The focus on ready relevant training will accelerate learning, reduce the decay of acquired skills, and provide readiness tracking of performance at an individual level."

This will provide MCM Commanders with the ability to rapidly re-plan and schedule emerging LCS\/MCM Mission Package assets and maintain situational awareness of heterogeneous groups of systems. The investment in single-system, day\/night, multi-mission airborne mine detection technologies usable at all water depths will be increased in order to reduce the MCM timeline and facilitate our capability to counter surface\/near surface mines in the Surf Zone or Beach Zone (BZ) at night. The viability of the preliminary design and schedule to support Fire Scout integration will be thoroughly explored. New mine neutralization technologies will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Navy expeditionary force capabilities in their assigned response mission to counter naval mine and maritime improvised explosive device threats. This technology will enhance the capability of the Maritime Expeditionary Standoff Response (MESR) System of Systems."

In general, investments transition emerging Science and Technology (S&T) results to acquisition programs; improve industrial capabilities in production, maintenance, repair and industrial base responsiveness; and advance manufacturing technology to reduce cost, improve performance, and responsiveness. Currently, the ManTech Program is focused on affordability improvements for specific key acquisition platforms as defined in the Navy ManTech Investment Strategy.  Key platforms currently targeted include: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)\/OHIO Replacement Program (ORP); DDG 51 Class Destroyer; CVN 78 Class Carrier; Joint Strike Fighter (JSF); and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter.  Office of Naval Research (ONR) ManTech helps these Navy programs achieve their respective affordability goals by transitioning developed manufacturing technology which, when implemented, results in needed cost reduction or cost avoidance.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this Program Element (PE), the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions.  Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The National Institutes for Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort."

Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element PE are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) ONR Experimentation (OE) develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet\/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions; and (5) support for the Naval Precision Strike Operations, providing the Navy capability to quickly locate, target, and strike critical targets.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance, input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). The strategy is also based on the unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century.  The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect\/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces. Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat. Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations. Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective. Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect\/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs. This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. \n\nThis PE supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports advanced development for battlespace shaping weapons including advanced undersea weapons.  It supports the MCM related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs). Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.  INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities.\n\nThe projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future. The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be modified or established to support further development.  These technology investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nDeveloping INPs requires the development of subsystems and components, and efforts to integrate these subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and tests in an appropriate environment. The efforts funded within this Program Element (PE) include concept and technology demonstrations of components and subsystems, which may be form, fit and function prototypes or scaled models that serve the same demonstration purpose.  The goal of these development efforts is to prove the technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  By demonstrating the general military utility and direct relevance to identified military needs, the technology becomes available for transition and further development within an emerging or new Program of Record.  INP investments do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but they do have the goal of moving out of Science and Technology (S&T) and into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.  Because to the nature of these projects described, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

SSL-TM will develop a maritime laser weapons system prototype and test it on a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant, and conduct the required laser weapon system engineering, design, integration and testing necessary to have a testable, experimental prototype. This system will be capable of supporting missions such as defense against small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and defeat. At-sea testing will be conducted on the full laser weapon system demonstrator (i.e., prototype) from a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant.\n\nInnovative Naval Prototypes (INP) and LA-Tech investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing Innovative Naval Prototype technologies from a Technology Readiness Level \n(TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. It is intended that prototypes developed within the INP portfolio,  requiring both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding, are demonstrated in a relevant environment to prove the feasibility of the new \ntechnological capability. Successful experimentations and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  Project 2480 SSL-TM contains the resources and associated program justification for the Directed Energy\/Electric Weapons capability oriented Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM) INP program.\n\nBecause to the nature of these efforts and research activities, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

This multi-year effort will build a Railgun Weapon System (RGWS) by designing, fabricating and integrating Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) subsystems and components into a weapon system that brings new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, the EM Railgun provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air & surface warfare, and naval surface fire support.\n\nEMRG is a multi-year effort in various stages of research and development within with the Navy's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) family of RDT&E programs. INP investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6.  It is intended that prototypes developed within this program, requiring both Budget Activity 2 (BA2) and Budget Activity 3 (BA3) funding, are demonstrated in a relevant environment to prove the feasibility of the new technological capability.  Successful experiments and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities, requiring significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  The Activity identified in Project Unit 2481 specifically addresses Advanced Technology Development in support of the Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development INP effort. \n\nDue to the nature of these projects, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

During FY18, the following advanced technology development efforts are planned: conduct system requirements and preliminary design assessments to further mature the development of an HPRF advanced development (prototype) system; perform trade studies to examine different technical approaches for developing the HPRF prototype and assessing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of emerging HPRF sources; begin the initial design of HPRF advanced payload activities; refine the prototype system performance requirements with input from operational stakeholders; study platform integration approaches and begin integration design activities; begin developing the hardware and software required to integrate an advanced HPRF payload for a future demonstration; analyze platform modifications; begin testing target classes for the Radio Frequency (RF) waveform specification being developed in BA 6.2; conduct kill-chain studies to identify and recommend design trade-offs to enable weapon system interoperability; begin live fire demonstration planning; and begin conceptually designing the next generation RF source technology."

Conduct development and planning for a demonstration of the system's ability to autonomously perform an assault support mission in an operationally representative environment. This demonstration will include performing autonomous take-off, conducting en route navigation, approaching and landing at multiple unprepared landing zones using supervisory control managed by a minimally trained Marine via a tablet-based application, detecting and avoiding ground based obstacles, and safely operating in degraded visual environments.\n\nClaws \nInitiate Claws which will develop the autonomy required to operate large and extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in an anti-access, anti-denial environment. To support large and extra-large UUV operations further forward and farther from the battle group, the technology will be evolved to allow operations with limited navigational fixes and limited communication opportunities. During FY18, at-sea testing of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 research technologies will be initiated in a realistic environment. At-sea data will be collected to support the further development of Claws technologies emerging out of the Claws applied research effort in PE 0602792N. Analysis of promising technologies will be conducted using laboratory and at-sea testing to provide realistic performance data.\n\nLarge Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV)\nComplete LDUUV, which was previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0603747N Undersea Warfare Advanced Technology Development.

Conduct development, testing and demonstration of the endurance technology and recommend a reliability strategy allowing for 30 days of continuous operations. Conduct a demonstration of the LDUUV fuel cell system installed in an LDUUV vehicle operating in an Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) like mission for 60 days. Continue to document the data analysis from the technology development in order to transition the information to Program Executive Office for the Littoral Combat Ship.\n\nLow-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)\nInitiate the Advanced Technology Development effort for the LOCUST project, which will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of military operations and areas of operations. LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses. This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution. During FY18, the LOCUST program will begin to develop a range of key technologies that will be integrated together in order to demonstrate a scalable system of inexpensive, commoditized, swarming UAVs that provide disruptive capabilities. Critical milestones for each major sub-system and system will be established, as well as a revisit to requirements and metrics throughout. Yearly war games will be utilized to shape and inform the demonstrations, which will be of increasing complexity in both mission and operating environment. The demonstrations in turn will provide the Navy with an ability to spiral out capability as needed. FY18 demonstrations are planned to encompass missions utilizing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and kinetic strike payloads.\n\nMedium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV)\nContinue the MDUSV project, which was previously funded predominantly in 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology\nDevelopment. The MDUSV project will design and build a prototype MDUSV platform sized for theater or global\nindependent operations. New autonomy, Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies will be integrated into the MDUSV platform. The capability of the MDUSV to autonomously perform ASW, MCM and EW missions over an extended period of time will be demonstrated during a 40-day period of at-sea testing. The capability to autonomously operate in all-weather conditions, using new technologies that provide robust perception using Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors that detect low radar cross-section craft with reduced vulnerability to jamming and reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions, will be assessed. The use of integrated acoustic and High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) mine influence sweep technologies as well as a novel ASW sensor suite that includes an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) will be tested on an instrumented range.\n\nTern\nComplete Tern, a joint Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) effort, previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development. Continue TERN technology development by conducting hardware and software testing and a sea-based Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) flight demonstration. The developed Tern enabling technologies have been focused on supporting a DDG-51 and LCS-2 based future long endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) capability that could be transitioned and implemented with minimal ship modification."

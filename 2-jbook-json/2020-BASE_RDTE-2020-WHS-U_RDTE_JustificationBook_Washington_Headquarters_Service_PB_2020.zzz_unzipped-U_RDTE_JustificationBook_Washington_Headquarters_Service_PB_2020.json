Effective FY 2020, DIU will transfer from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z with a functional realignment of resources across the FYDP to OUSD(R&E). In FY 2018, Congress reduced -$6.000 million to the DIU RDT&E program."

One of the tenets of this priority is to expand the Department's ability to access leading edge technological innovations through commercial partnerships.  The funding DIUx executes is critical as it incentivizes non-traditional defense sector companies to work with and invest in advancing DoD future capabilities.  \n\n Some of the projects undertaken include:  \n- Hardened Network Defense that provides warfighters improved network security by obscuring vital services and data, thereby significantly decreasing the ability of advancing cyber threats to map, attack or exploit tactical systems.\n- Command, Control, and Situational Awareness web-based software platform that supports user's ability to visualize relevant activities and operational metrics, collaboratively plan and approve defense activities, and monitor\/manage subsequent.

With appropriate funding, DDS leverage, its private sector expertise to fully support the build of a system prototype \/ proof-of-concept. RDT&E funding is required to support the DDS mission, which includes the ability to build software prototypes to prove out concepts for mission critical projects identified by the Department.\n\nEnsuring that DDS has RDT&E capabilities will increase DoD\u2019s ability to leverage DDS\u2019s unique technical expertise to determine which private sector software development best practices and\/or technology work best for the Department. Furthermore, the development and testing of DDS prototypes, and the insight gained, would significantly lower development costs and delivery times through traditional DoD methods."

The former is dependent on RDT&E funding that supports the ability to acquire the most current technological solution and\/or support from vendors well versed in the most advanced technological solutions.  \n\nThe requested RDT&E funds will enable DDS to build prototypes and implement proof-of-concept tests for some key OSD projects. These projects will support missions in and out of theater, as well as long term goals of the department to modernize its offensive and defensive technological capabilities.  DoD interest in leveraging DDS to operate in this area to solve hard and impossible problems is persistent.

These problems vary in scope and complexity, but at a minimum, when resolved, have a positive impact on the warfighter\u2019s mission and capabilities.  The DDS involvement may be in the development of new code, product management, advising on code development processes and releases, and hacking or re-writing existing policies or processes that are antiquated or otherwise unnecessary.  The DDS engages on highly troubled projects to quickly implement fixes that ultimately reduce schedule slip, increase security, lower costs, improve user experiences, and accelerate performance.    \nSome examples of current projects include: replacing the MEPCOM Integrated Resources System; reimagining the user interface and associated databases for the Defense Property System; devising a hard and software solution to counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that attack warfighters in theater; and developing a novel, modern approach to network defense.  The DDS team is comprised of digital experts with backgrounds in policy, contracts, design, and engineering who collectively use their private industry and federal government experience to identify solutions to problems and rapidly devise and implement solutions."

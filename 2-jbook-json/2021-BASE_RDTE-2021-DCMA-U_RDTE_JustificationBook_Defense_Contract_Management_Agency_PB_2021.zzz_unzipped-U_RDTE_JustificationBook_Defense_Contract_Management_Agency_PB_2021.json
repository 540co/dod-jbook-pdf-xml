                        "val": "DCMA is currently engaged in several major initiatives to improve our information technology environment.  Information technology is the primary enabling capability our acquisition workforce is reliant upon to communicate with contractors, the DoD acquisition community and our customers.  These initiatives are driven by the National Defense Strategy business reform line of effort.  On December 21, 2017, the Reform Management Group directed the Information Technology (IT) and Business Systems Reform Lead to review Fourth Estate IT networks, policies, business processes, functions, costs and Chief Information Officer (CIO) organizational structures and manpower requirements across the Fourth Estate.  In support of this directive, DCMA is structuring its information technology investments to be in synchronization with the vision of the DoD guidance. One early result of this review is the decision to transfer commodity information technology administrative control to Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), which will occur in FY 2021. \n\nDCMA's IT investment strategy is being driven by the Director's initiatives to: 1) Develop Mission Business Systems; 2) Leverage Commodity IT Buying Power Through DISA; and 3) Focus On The Last Tactical Mile.  These initiatives directly align and support the Optimization and Modernization efforts of the DoD CIO, which include: 1) Network Optimization; 2) Data Center Optimization; 3) Mission Partner Engagement; 4) Defense Travel Modernization ; 5) Enterprise Collaboration; 6) Consolidation of Cyber and IT Responsibilities; 7) Rationalize Business Systems; 8) Streamline IT Commodity Purchasing.\n\nDevelopment and research initiatives are a core component in DCMA\u2019s ability to align efforts appropriately to the DoD CIO IT Reform Initiative. In order to meet the needs of the DoD community, DCMA\u2019s current efforts are focused on the development of investments in two core areas: 1)  DCMA App Store; and 2) Wide Area Work-Flow (WAWF).\n \nThese initiatives will empower mobile and fixed users ability to  utilize DoD enterprise capabilities with the same level or better efficiency and effectiveness. DCMA also has a mandate to align with DoD strategy for digital modernization of enterprise capabilities. This involves migrating DCMA application infrastructure to enterprise hosting environments and modern technology platforms, rationalizing existing applications to ensure capabilities align with mission requirements, and adopting new DoD strategies for modern software development methodologies."

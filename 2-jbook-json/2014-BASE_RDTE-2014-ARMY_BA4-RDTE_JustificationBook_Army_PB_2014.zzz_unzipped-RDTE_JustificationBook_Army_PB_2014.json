Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense and Space\/High Altitude capabilities.  As the Army proponent for space, high altitude and GMD, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities.  As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to review programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities. \n\nProject TR5 funds United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/ Army Strategic Command (USASMDC\/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop and the associated operational prototyping, experimentation, operational analysis, and modeling and simulation to support of current and future Forces.  \n\nProject TR7 funds the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I).  It is is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), and Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (RAM). The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the Warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools\/Test Beds for evolving space superiority and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance address space, missile defense and high altitude. The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for EADSIM to provide the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis."

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  \n\nAutonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS) provides mine and explosive hazards stand-off detection, marking and neutralization capability for the dismounted soldier.  AMDS consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles.  The payloads are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards.  AMDS will transition from Technical Development to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2013.  \n\nThe Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system will provide a suite of vehicle-mounted capabilities that enable route clearance patrols to achieve higher rates of advance by accurately detecting and adjudicating potential explosive hazards with reduced hazard interrogation time.  The system will automatically nominate potential hazards on the move and at standoff distance, and then let route clearance teams decide whether to perform more detailed examinations and identification of those hazards using additional tools within the FREHD suite.   FREHD will also provide threat visualization and control capabilities that enable route clearance and allow Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and related mission personnel to remotely view video feeds of the hazard and remotely control the apparatus.  The increased rate of advance will improve route clearance time, while the increased standoff improves force protection.   FREHD will begin transition of Advanced Technology Objective efforts from the Science and Technology community, and conduct program initiation activities via a Materiel Development Decision in FY 2013.   Subject to timely program initiation and confirmation of technology maturity, FREHD technology development efforts will continue in FY 2014."

These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  \n\nAutonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS) provides mine and explosive hazards stand-off detection, marking and neutralization capability for the dismounted soldier.  AMDS consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles.  The payloads are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards.  AMDS will transition from Technical Development to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2013.  \n\nThe Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system will provide a suite of vehicle-mounted capabilities that enable route clearance patrols to achieve higher rates of advance by accurately detecting and adjudicating potential explosive hazards with reduced hazard interrogation time.  The system will automatically nominate potential hazards on the move and at standoff distance, and then let route clearance teams decide whether to perform more detailed examinations and identification of those hazards using additional tools within the FREHD suite.   FREHD will also provide threat visualization and control capabilities that enable route clearance and allow Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and related mission personnel to remotely view video feeds of the hazard and remotely control the apparatus.  The increased rate of advance will improve route clearance time, while the increased standoff improves force protection.   FREHD will begin transition of Advanced Technology Objective efforts from the Science and Technology community, and conduct program initiation activities via a Materiel Development Decision in FY 2013.   Subject to timely program initiation and confirmation of technology maturity, FREHD technology development efforts will continue in FY 2014."

SOM program will focus on replacing current smoke pots to provide the Joint Land Forces with a medium area screening obscuration device.  The initial increment, Increment 1, will focus on developing a SOM system capable of obscuring the Visual through Near IR wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Future SOM Increments 2 and 3 will incorporate bi-spectral and multi-spectral effects. The SOM has the capability to quickly produce (less than 15 seconds) medium duration (20 minutes), medium area (11 meters wide x 20 meters length x 5.25 meters height) screening obscuration effects, screening an area equivalent to three times the size of a large combat vehicle.  The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain; excluding enclosed areas.  SOM will be deployed to accomplish the following mission types:  avoid observation, defense of a battle position, and assault position."

These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces despite worldwide development and proliferation of enhanced armored vehicle protection technologies. To achieve this, DFAT will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures. All ammunition development funds within this PE are managed to facilitate transitions between phases, avoid administrative delays, and focus resources on the most promising areas. \n\nThe M829E4 cartridge is an unguided, direct fire, Abrams delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide fast response lethality to rapidly destroy threat targets with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protection Systems (APS) in the close fight from 0-2km (T) and to 0-4km (O). The M829E4 will be compatible with the 120mm Current Force Abrams Main Battle Tank. FY 2011 M829E4 Cartridge funding supported the completion of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I and the initiation of Phase II. FY 2012 funding supported design finalization, design verification, testing and fabrication of Design, Test and Evaluation hardware and beginning of testing. FY 2013 features building of test hardware for final qualification testing. FY 2014 supports hardware and performance test, conducting mandated Live Fire Testing & Evaluation (LFT&E) and staffing of Milestone C.\n\nIn FY 2014 the Target Practice Day\/ Night\/ Thermal (TP D\/N\/T) cartridge is a 40mm grenade training cartridge. The Low Velocity variant is for training with the M203\/ M320 grenade launchers and the High Velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun. Both of these cartridges will provide the War Fighter with a non dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge which replicates the impact signature of respective tactical ammunition and can be seen day or night, by the unaided eye or through night vision and thermal weapon sights."

The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations. After a Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I competitive shoot off in FY 2011 ATK was awarded the option to continue with Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2014. FY 2012 supported the continuation of Phase II of the M829E4 cartridge. FY 2013 funding supports design finalization, design verification, fabrication and testing of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) hardware. The full performance of the M829E4 is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification. FY 2014 supports conducting hardware and performance testing, mandated Live Fire Test & Evaluation (LFT&E) and completion of Milestone C."

During Phase I (15 months), the Government awarded two separate Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts culminating in a demonstration test and competitive source selection to down select to one contractor for the 31 month Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) Phase II. The down select was based on the demonstrated performance of the cartridge design, proposed systems engineering and management approach for Phase II, and the total program cost estimate for each contractor at the time of the demonstration test. ATK was awarded the option to continue EMD Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2014. Upon successful completion of Milestone C, a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option will be awarded to ATK in 3Q FY 2014. The contract also contains options for two additional production years. All production options are Firm Fixed Price (FFP)."

The low velocity variant is for training with the M203\/M320 grenade launchers and the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun. Both of these cartridges will provide the War Fighter with a non dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge which replicates the impact signature of respective tactical ammunition and can be seen day or night, by the unaided eye or through night vision devices and thermal weapon sights. The program will carry competitive prototypes for each cartridge variant through the Engineering Manufacturing Development phase. In FY 2014 a competition will be held to select the EMD contractors. Afterwards a preliminary design review will be held. Advanced prototypes will be built and tested."

Both variants utilize the same critical technologies, making concurrent acquisitions a logical alternative. As part of the EMD source selection, a shoot-off will be conducted to evaluate potential designs. Within funding constraints multiple contractor designs for the HV cartridge and for the LV cartridge will be awarded EMD contracts in the 2QTR FY 2014 with Milestone C scheduled for 1QTR FY 2016. The contracts will contain options for LRIP and production. The strategy is flexible and prepared to award production options early if the contractor(s) complete the development early. The Army will attempt to negotiate for the data rights so long term production can be produced to a single design for the HV and LV variants."

Funding in this project will continue to address Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), survivability, Operational Needs Statement (ONS) issues. \n\nEngineering Change Proposal (ECP) (C51), will enable the Stryker FOV to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with an in-vehicle network, this will ensure the FOV can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility."

The National Military Strategy requires an Army that is rapidly deployable and strategically responsive across the full spectrum of operations. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team encompasses capabilities and characteristics that are needed but were not available until the first SBCT was declared operationally capable.  The Stryker enables the Army to respond immediately to urgent operational requirements.  Funding in this project will continue to address survivability enhancements and Operational Needs Statement (ONS) issues."

In May 2012, Phase I (Development) of the Stryker ECP program was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  The Phase II (Continued Engineering Design\/Logistics Design\/Prototype Build\/Test) decision is scheduled for 14 March 2013.  This decision will select what technologies will go forward to Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and the variants to which the technologies will be applied (i.e., Flat Bottom and\/or Double V Hull).  Based on the Phase II decision, development engineering will continue to support Preliminary Design Review (PDR), prototype build, and test and evaluation.  The Phase III (Production) decision point will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II."

The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to forces on a global scale.  The REF provides the Army's rapid response capability to develop, prototype, acquire and integrate Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed, deploying and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment and spiral development.  It plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs, desired future force capabilities and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders. \n \nThe REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years. The REF Teams deployed in theater work with Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure and deliver solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility, permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  \n\nThe REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military\/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  The REF key tasks are:\n- Be responsive to tactical unit commanders engage Brigade Combat Team\/Brigade Commanders (BCT\/BDE CDRs) early and often\n- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement\/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (ONS\/JUONS) Gaps to meet urgent needs\n- In coordination with Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) develop materiel solutions to counter Asymmetric Threats\n- Ensure adequate training and sustainment are provided with every capability\n- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands\n- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army \n- Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment\n- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law\n- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units\n \nThe REF Integrated Priority list (RIPL) consists of the REF top ten priorities based on requirements received from deployed units, and drives all REF efforts.  The priorities with associated metrics, as of 06 February 2013, are:\n\n1. Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat  (46 Requirements\/42 Projects)\n2. Small Combat Outpost (COP)\/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection and Sustainment  (60 Requirements\/52 Projects)\n3. Dismounted Operations Support  (40 Requirements\/34 Projects)\n4. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operating Environments (OEs)  (42 Requirements\/42 Projects)\n5. Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command  (24 Requirements\/16 Projects)\n6. Counter Ambush (Precision against Small Arms Fire (SAF) and Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) (4 Requirements\/6 Projects)\n7. Advanced Escalation of Force and Non-Lethal Messaging (10 Requirements\/7 Projects)\n8. Entry Control Point (ECP) Operations and Vehicle Search Operations (10 Requirements\/5 Projects)\n9. Route Clearance Support (8 Requirements\/5 Projects)\n10. Other (61 Requirements\/60 Projects)\n\nTotal:  305 Requirements\/269 Projects\n\n\nThe REF FY14 RDT&E Request of $1.515 million (Base) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Defeat, enhanced Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, Tactical Command, Control and Communication tools. \n\nRDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions. RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed US Army Forces problems with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier- any modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) item has to be tested."

This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: rapidly adapting Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) equipment to meet operational needs and developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia. All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment is provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved program of record or terminated through the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army equipping and fielding decisions.  REF capabilities routinely serve to bridge specific Operational Needs Statement (ONS) and Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) gaps to meet urgent requirements."

The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (PORs).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army PORs.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these National capabilities into enduring Army programs."

Near term efforts include the integration of goggles with the weapon sights for Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) in a realistic operating environment, thereby increasing Soldier lethality. This project also develops a Family of Weapon Sights (FWS) with fused electro-optical performance, including focal plane arrays and high resolution micro-displays.  FWS enabling technologies increase product resolution, range, and imaging performance. New technologies will improve Soldier lethality, survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort to combat and training environments. In addtion this project will explore insertion of technology that improves the Soldier's ability to detect Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Detection."

CSP TLA provides the Battlefield Commander a vastly improved TLA allowing timely use of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Coordinate Seeking Weapons (CSWs) across the battlespace.  CSP TLA is being procured as an upgraded capability for the Gray Eagle UAS program and can be integrated onto other manned and unmanned aerial platforms.  The funds associated with this funding line are for the technology maturity of the TLA Laser.  Once this laser technology has been matured to the appropriate Technology Readiness Level (TRL), it will be cut into the TLA development effort and eventual production to replace the CSP HD payloads on the Gray Eagle platform.\n \nThis program has no FY 2013 Base or OCO requirement."

Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced products that give Soldiers superiority on the battlefield.  Near term efforts include the integration of Helmet Mounted Displays (HMDs) with weapon sights for a Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) capability in a realistic environment, increasing Soldier situational awareness and lethality and integrates technology, which detects enemy snipers using precise target information to mitigate operational risk before sniper fire occurs.  This project also integrates high resolution thermal focal plane arrays, integrated ballistic solutions for auto-adjusting reticles, and wireless technology with weapon sights, increasing range, performance, and capability, while decreasing system size and weight.  These integration efforts improve Soldier situational awareness, lethality, survivability, mobility, and comfort to combat and training environments. Funds in this program are a realignment of funds from program Night Vision Systems Engineering Development , Program Element 0604710A; Project L67 for more efficient program management."

However technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  This program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration\/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site\/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention).  All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., \"technology is heading for user to implement\")."

The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment.  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, \"Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management.\"\n\nOur broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at our installations.  The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community."

The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by an EAB Working Group (EABWG) that includes staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The EABWG coordinates all NDCEE activities and reports back to the EAB Principals.  The EABWG is, in turn, supported by a Technical Working Group that addresses the details of NDCEE program execution.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program also assists in the formulation of suggested technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative \"shop floor\".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks."

The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders.  Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to develop a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment directed Chemical Management Enterprise Information Integration capability that will allow Army net-centric hazardous material and ESOH 2.0 NetCentric data management capabilities per the Secretary of the Army Directive 2009-03 \"Army Data Management\" and DoD Directive 8320.2 \"Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense.\"  Prior to funding being committed, Army and DoD environmental information technology stakeholders meet to determine which high priority EITM interface requirements need upgrades to incorporate new security and other information technology requirements."

The Increment 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Increment 1 and by leveraging proven Government and Commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated  Network Management to optimize  planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Increment 2 extends the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Increment 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Increment 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Increment 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.   WIN-T Increment 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T adopts  \"Colorless Core\" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the \"core\" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Increment 1b network which enables information sharing between Increment 1b and Increment 2.\n\nThe WIN-T Increment 2 capabilities are identified for fielding to Armored, Infantry, and Stryker BCTs and Division Headquarters.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node have both satellite and Line-of-Sight communication capability.  The Soldier Network Extension provides satellite communication only.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node are deployed at Division, Brigade and Battalion echelons. The Soldier Network Extension serves as the S3 vehicle at Battalion level and is also deployed down to Company level.  \n\nWIN-T Increment 3 mature technologies will be inserted into Increment 2 units."

The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nInc 2 fields new capabilities to the current force.  Inc 2 accomplishes this with planned early fieldings of mature technologies from Inc 3.  Inc 2 will be upgraded with technology from Inc 3 in the form of technology inserts. A Follow-on Test and Evaluation (FOTE) will be conducted in FY2013 followed by a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision review.  There is no plan to rebuy and replace Inc 2 with Inc 3. These technical inserts will upgrade the Inc 2 architecture to include the following elements: Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (JC4ISR) radio, Highband Radio Frequency Unit Multiband Terrestrial antenna (HRFU-MT) (Dual band C\/Ku), and Network Operations (NetOps) Build 3.0.  The JC4ISR radio and antenna upgrades will be placed in the Tactical Communication Node (TCN) v1, Point of Presence (PoP) v1, and Tactical Relay Tower(TR-T) v1 and will upgrade those configuration items to TCN v1A, PoP v1A, and TR-T v1A.  The Inc 3 production program will also provide retrofits to Inc 2 fielded units.  Inc 3 will tech-insert the  Modular Communications Node Advanced Enclave (MCN-AE) to all the Inc 2 units.  Inc 3 will also provide the JC4ISR radio and antenna retrofits for the Inc 2 units procured before FY2016 and for TR-T inserts to ensure interoperability.  Increment 3 introduces the air tier through the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and a Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Local Area Network (LAN) with a port for National Security Agency intranet (NSAnet)."

WIN-T Inc 3 connects all users to each other from theater down to the maneuver company level, to Joint and multinational elements, and to the Defense Information System Network (DISN).  WIN-T Inc 3 is key to the Army's Network Modernization program. It provides a leap forward in network capacity with improved system reliability and robustness, made possible by the new Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) version 3.0 embedded on the Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance (JC4ISR) radios. The technology advances in the combination of the JC4ISR radios and HNW will provide a throughput capability four times greater than currently fielded networking radios.  The Air Tier implementation of the JC4ISR radios and HNW 3.0 will offload significant amounts of traffic from satellites with reduced operating cost to the Army, freeing satellite bandwidth and providing the Commander the ability to allocate bandwidth resources at the critical point on the battlefield. WIN-T Inc 3 Network Operations (NetOps) software provides the on the move capability to meet the Global Information Grid (GIG) NetCentric Vision including Information Assurance and Network Centric Enterprise Services with mature planning, monitoring, and controlling capabilities; additionally implementation of the WIN-T Inc 3 NetOps solution supports the Army's NetOps convergence goals. WIN-T Inc 3 mature technologies will be inserted into WIN-T Inc 2 units."

The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAn evolutionary acquisition strategy is being utilized to provide for the timely insertion of new technologies into Army communication systems by adhering to the basic principles of the DoD Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA).  This allows the Army to keep pace with changing commercial technology and maintain required interoperability with other joint, strategic and commercial standards-based networks. Building on previous increments, Inc 3 provides better connectivity and greater network access via JC4ISR radio and antenna, Network Centric Waveform (NCW), Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) version 3.0, and integrated Network Operations. It manages, prioritizes, and protects information through NetOps while reducing organizational and operational support. It ensures communications interoperability with Joint, Allied, Coalition, Current Force, and Commercial voice and data networks. Inc 3 shall be interoperable with the other WIN-T increments while maintaining interoperability with the Army currently fielded transport systems. The technologies in Inc 3 have matured to a level that provide significant capability enhancement over the current network.  Inc 3 technology is being tested and released over time and, once proven; Inc 3 technology will be available for insertion into WIN-T Increment 1 and Increment 2.  \n\nThe ADM of May 18, 2009 approved an initial Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) for Inc 3. A follow-on Increment 3 ADM on July 31, 2009 permitted the obligation of remaining FY2009 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds to resource EMD efforts including development of the Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance radio (JC4ISR) to support the air-tier capability. A revised ADM was approved on October 22, 2010. Inc 3 received approval for program restructure at the October 31, 2011 Army Configuration Steering Board (CSB). Efforts in accordance with the restructured program are performed under the current Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract. A Follow-on EMD contract is anticipated to be awarded in 3QFY13 followed by a Critical Design Review (CDR) in 4QFY13. A Production Readiness Review (PRR) is scheduled for 2QFY16 leading to a Milestone C decision in 3QFY16."

The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractors facilities."

The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractors facilities."

The MNNEC has a future force focus, endeavoring to define migration strategies for Net-Centric capabilities in the 2010-2025 timeframe with part of the work to determine the time-phased implementations of a Multi-National Network Enabled Capability. The end results would be an integration of national C2\/C4ISR systems into an NCES environment to include the NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC)."

Army watercraft equipment supports the conduct of riverine, Logistics Over The Shore (LOTS), Joint Logistics Over The Shore (JLOTS), inter and intratheater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100-01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and its Major Components). Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterway and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conduct operations through littoral entry points, developed, undeveloped, and austere access points, and in non-permissive, and\/or denied access scenarios. The Army uses a spectrum of lighterage and floating craft, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intratheater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to ocean-going and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port\/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems to support LOTS\/JLOTS. Capability will be appropriately incorporated into development of the Family of Maneuver Support Vessels (FMSV) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) studies.\n\nFunding will also be used to enhance the maturation of equipment, systems and sub-systems into Army Watercraft for the purposes of improved performance, energy efficiency, environmental, and regulatory compliance.  Funding is also used to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will advance critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time studying, developing, and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, as those areas are to be imminently informed by the Army Watercraft Systems Board of Directors (AWS BOD).\n\nFleet wide funding requirements will complete core requirements for development, prototype operational testing, and military unit assessment of externally mounted accommodation units in support of crew and supercargo berthing, integration of Escalation of Force (EoF) force protection enhancements, to include both lethal and non-lethal, development of Battle Command on the Move (BCOTM) and Common Operating Picture (COP)\/interoperability aspects of existing C4ISR, enhancement of developing environmental and energy efficiency technologies to ensure continued compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements, and study\/development of digital technology integration in the areas of near and real time logistics management, area situational awareness, trend analysis, Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+), equipment monitoring and diagnostics\/prognostics and related functional areas, as well as study, and development of Terminal Operations (ship to shore)."

These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness.  This project also supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical Distribution Capabilities to include cargo aerial delivery systems; which provide improved safety and accuracy while increasing survivability of aircraft, personnel, and equipment.  The project supports the development of tactical heater systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support."

The Concept and Technology Development program supports the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment. The mission includes developing onboard fuels quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics foot print; developing water reutilization systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; and material systems to decrease the logistics foot print and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in the theater. This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile theaters of operations.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield."

Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness.  Programs are aligned to meet Future Force (F2) requirements stressed within concept documents and organizational structures.  The PE provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans.  The Projects supported by this PE are: \n\n(PROJ 836) funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration.  Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  Products from this project will transition to 832.\n\n(PROJ 808) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and insect control measures.  These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug\/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this project will transition to 849.\n\n(PROJ 811) funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug\/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug\/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Products from this project will transition to Project 812. \n\n(PROJ VS7) program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The force design will increase the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operation needs.  Products from this project will transition to VS8.\n\nThis program is managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA)  of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command."

These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug\/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug\/vaccine works, and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers.  Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices.  This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed; to enhance battlefield readiness.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members.  Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production)."

In 2010, the AMEDD accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission."

Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides operators electronic, real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to tactical vehicle mounted leaders so that when they dismount their vehicles, they still have access to the common operating picture (COP) and have full situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight. \n\nBeginning in FY 18, this project funds the development and prototyping of the next generation of Nett Warrior, leveraging the extensive technology improvements that will occur over the next five years."

The NW MS C was approved 3 April 2012 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award. Conduct Developmental Test and Evaluation planned for 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management. The Developmental and Operational tests are validation of the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to a production decision in the 2QFY13 to procure the CS14 quantity of NW systems and support. NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of the latest commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously. This is the next increment of Nett Warrior that will leverage technology available in the FY 18 time frame."

The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach with two sub-increments that integrate mature technologies to build to the full capability. Each sub-increment progressively reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved environmental cooling, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and miniaturized communication devices."

Funding facilitates demonstration of relatively mature technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical \/ operational scenarios, taking technologies through and beyond Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. Efforts include competitive prototyping earlier in development to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs of record. Efforts funded will be selected by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transition. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for fulfilling the goals of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 by enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) programs and acquisition programs. This PE also provides analytical support for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  It is used to centrally funds AoAs for new program starts that require an material development decision and do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for material development. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n     \nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC), U.S. Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), and\/or Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)."

Funding facilitates demonstration of relatively mature technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical\/operations scenarios, taking technologies through and beyond Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6.  Efforts include competitive prototyping earlier in development to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs of record.  Efforts funded will be selected by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group (ESG) to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for fulfilling the goals of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 by enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishing a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) programs and acquisition programs.  This project also provides analytical support for AoAs in FY 13. To qualify for funding, a material development decision will be required. The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in the PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), the Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), U.S Army TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA)."

The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

Extensive market research determined that this hybrid airship has never been manufactured as a full-scale functioning system and critical hybrid airship technology at the system and subsystem level is mainly available from non-traditional Department of Defense contractors.  An OTA agreement was preferred in order to gain access to critical technology within the Non-Traditional industrial community in this area and to promote competition. The OTA Agreement was competitively awarded using a competitive Request for Proposal process.  A Joint Military Utility Assessment (JMUA) will be conducted in theatre following the system development and transport. A Material Development Decision (MDD) is expected 90-180 days after completion of the JMUA Phase 1 (the first 2 months of the overall JMUA time period)."

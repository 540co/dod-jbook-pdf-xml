First, the space survivability and surveillance area develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Space Force systems. Second, the spacecraft payload technologies area improves satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities. Third, the spacecraft protection area develops technologies for protecting United States space assets in potential hostile settings. The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and  control technologies, and their interactions. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602298F, 0602601F, 0602602F, 0602605F, and 0602788F.\n\nThis work will still be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles (AFRL\/RV) Technology Directorate located at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. This is an administrative realignment and not a New Start.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2019 Air Force penalty total is $50.0M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

GPS User Equipment (UE) consists of standardized receivers, antennas, antenna electronics, and other related equipment, grouped together in sets to derive navigation and time information transmitted from GPS satellites. These receiver sets are used by the Department of Defense (DoD). Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds UE development, integration, test, and analysis for new PNT receiver capabilities in Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) across all military platforms using GPS services.\n          \nThe Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) Increment (Inc) 1 program is responsible for the development of standard modernized receiver form factors for the Service-nominated lead platforms. The MGUE Inc 1 Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) on 24 July 2014. MGUE Inc 1 is initiating a new family of modernized GPS receivers that will deliver significantly improved capability to counter current and emerging PNT threats and enable military operations in a NAVWAR environment where current legacy receiver performance would be compromised. MGUE Inc 1 received a Milestone A decision in April 2012. The program received direction in February 2014 from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) to execute a new acquisition strategy, accelerating the program to provide test units faster to facilitate military end users. The MGUE program received a Milestone B decision in January 2017. \n          \nThe MGUE Inc 2 effort will continue to expand Military-Code (M-Code) receiver technology into additional applications (space receivers and precision guided munitions), and develop a modernized Handheld device to meet Service requirements. This effort leverages the MGUE Inc 1 technology to the maximum extent while addressing the production of M-Code integrated circuits far into the future. The MGUE Inc 2 program is being executed in three parts: 1) Risk Reduction Activities, 2)  Miniature Serial Interface (MSI) Receiver Card Middle Tier Acquisition rapid prototyping, and 3) Joint Modernized GPS Handheld Receiver Middle Tier Acquisition rapid prototyping effort.  The JROC approved the MGUE Inc 2 CDD on 6 April 2018.  The Air Force Service Acquisition Executive approved the MGUE Inc 2 Acquisition Strategy to include designation of two Middle Tier Acquisition Rapid Prototype efforts: 1) Miniature Serial Interface (MSI) Receiver Cards to include next-generation Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and 2) Joint, Modernized Handheld Receiver.\n          \nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $2.381 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n          \nThis Program Element (PE) may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MGUE weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n                   \nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The effort spans the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase through design and includes integration and test of M-Code receivers into Service-nominated lead platforms. This effort also includes the security and compatibility certification of GPS receiver cards as a part of the integration effort. The Service lead platforms will select from the available vendors to integrate and perform operational testing with funding from the MGUE program. This supports compliance with PL 111-383, section 913.\n          \n          The MGUE Inc 2 program developed an Acquisition Strategy to continue MGUE development by:  addressing long term producibility of MGUE ASICs, identifying a U.S. owned trusted foundry for ASIC development, delivering GPS receiver cards to meet stringent Inc 2 requirements, and developing a modernized GPS handheld receiver to meet the needs of the Services.  The MGUE Inc 2 program is being executed in three parts:  1) Risk Reduction Activities, 2) MSI Middle Tier Acquisition  rapid prototyping, and 3) Joint Modernized GPS Handheld Receiver Middle Tier Acquisition rapid prototyping effort.  The Air Force Service Acquisition Executive approved the MGUE Inc 2 Acquisition Strategy to include designation of two Middle Tier Acquisition Rapid Prototype efforts: 1) Miniature Serial Interface Receiver Card (includes next-generation ASIC) and 2) Joint, Modernized Handheld Receiver."

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires continued global collection of CC and TWI data to contribute to the space domain awareness. Without the CC and TWI data, AF production of global predictive weather data would be severely impacted, affecting daily air operations and intelligence gathering for strategic mission planning, especially around the contested environment.\n\nElectro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) Weather Systems (EWS) is a component of JROC-approved SBEM materiel solutions specifically designed to address CC and TWI needs post-DMSP mission end of life.\n\nBased on recently completed SBEM Capability Assessment and Strategy Review (CASR) in April 2019, the current EWS acquisition strategy focuses on a distributed LEO architecture, for scalability and increased operational resilience. The Space Force will pursue prototyping of latest industry capabilities for simplified sensor designs, while meeting CC and TWI requirements and data latencies in a distributed architecture.  The EWS prototyping effort will:\n\n1) Explore low-Size, Weight & Power\/simplified EO\/IR sensor designs in highly competitive design sprints, utilizing variety of experimental\/prototyping contract vehicles \n2) Conduct system technology end-to-end demonstrations, from prototype build, Integration & Test, Launch, ground Telemetry\/Tracking & Commanding (TT&C) and on-orbit data collection to data processing and dissemination to the Weather Centrals\n3) Explore business models for the feasibility of commercially available data. \n\nIn addition, the program may integrate sensors into a commercial & Government communication transport layer, leveraging web services to ensure delivery of data products to end users.\n\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM Analysis of Alternatives and validated by the JROC.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EWS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Space Enterprise Consortium (SpEC) Other Transaction (OT) #1 is the prototyping effort, which will focus on maturing multi-spectral imaging capabilities to collect & disseminate terrestrial atmospheric phenomena to support DoD operations, while assessing industrial capabilities to provide CC and TWI data in a viable commercial business model. The program will pursue simplified sensor designs and corresponding lower size, weight and power prototypes potentially hosted on a proliferated LEO mesh network.  To minimize risks associated with rapid prototyping effort to replace DMSP constellation, SpEC OT #2 will focus on further developing high maturity EO\/IR system designs in competitive design sprints in a parallel path to SpEC OT #1.

EWS will initially pursue competitive bids to field technology demonstration EO\/IR prototype system capable of fulfilling CC and TWI. Once technology demonstrations of the prototype system has proven successful, the EWS program will transition to fielding operational systems capable of meeting CC and TWI requirements.\n\nPhase I will leverage ongoing experimental EO\/IR prototype development projects under AFRL's SBIR contracts to understand operational utility of available and developing EO\/IR sensors.\n\nPhase II SpEC OT #1 will involve competitive bids for multiple system designs using SpEC OT contracts for rapid prototyping effort to fulfill CC and TWI requirements, while exploring valid commercial business models for industry to provide weather data as a service.\n\nIn order to minimize risks to DMSP constellation coverage, the Space Force will also pursue SpEC OT #2 for risk mitigation, pursuing competitive bid on low- risk, high-maturity system-level solutions in a parallel effort to the prototyping effort, that can fully address CC and TWI requirements as part of the Family of Systems comprised of civil and International partnerships. This risk mitigation option will carry two vendors to PDR level design and include assessment of prototype system performance and potential for transition to operations.\n\nFollowing the acquisition strategy approval and assessment of the simplified sensors' performance with the SF weather mission, the SF plans to assess costs to ramp production in future phase III to reduce revisit time to maximize warfighter utility."

Weather System Follow-on (WSF) is a component of SBEM efforts to develop capabilities to satisfy weather Gap 3 Ocean Surface Vector Winds (OSVW), Gap 8 Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI), and Gap 11 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Energetic Charged Particles (LEO ECP). Gap 3 OSVW and Gap 8 TCI require a space-based microwave sensor to provide polarimetric ocean surface wind direction and speed required for naval sea operations, as well as fighter sortie generations and marine amphibious operations. Gap 11 LEO ECP requires in situ ECP sensor for space situational awareness. The earliest possible launch options are being integrated in the design for critical gaps.\n\nDoD established WSF as a Pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) with the Space Force as the lead component. Based on the SBEM AoA results, the WSF initial thrusts will be to enable:\n\n1) DoD use of data collected by civil, international and other DoD space systems;\n2) Timely weather collection over broad oceans in support of maneuvering forces;\n3) Space weather capabilities to characterize operational orbits, space situational awareness, and the ionosphere.\n\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM AoA and validated by the JROC.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WSF weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The acquisition strategy for WSF is based on validated SBEM AoA results from FY2014 and subsequent acquisition strategy development activities that were conducted in FY 2015.  The WSF acquisition strategy focuses on streamlined acquisition process for providing materiel solutions to OSVW, TCI & LEO ECP, as validated by the JROC; deliver microwave sensing solution to address DoD needs for OSVW and TCI capabilities and deliver space environment sensing solution to address LEO ECP capabilities for on-orbit attributions and anomaly resolutions.  \n\nThe Space Force is conducting a technology demonstration of the Compact Ocean Surface Wind Vector Radiometer (COWVR) sensor in partnership with NASA Space Test Program (STP) to launch and integrate with International Space Station (ISS), utilizing their unique technology demonstration capabilities for on-orbit demonstration of COWVR technology.  SMC's STP is the leading SF organization spearheading the NASA partnership, while SMC Development Corps. is responsible for the COWVR project and funding and providing programmatic support to enable COWVR sensor to ISS integration\/technology demonstration.\n            \nThe program awarded a contract for WSF satellite, capable of meeting all three weather capability gaps, in a full and open competition environment, in order to reduce overall program cost.  The Space Force is procuring one WSF-M satellite with an option for a second satellite.  WSF-M first satellite (SV-1) ILC is FY 2024 to mitigate any potential weather coverage gaps.  WSF-M SV-2 ILC is currently projected for FY 2028.  The WSF SV-2 will be functionally equivalent to SV-1.  Naval Research Lab Blossom Point Tracking Facility (BPTF) will be used as a viable unclassified EGS-compatible SOC for WSF-M. BPTF consists of a satellite mission operations center, multiple ground antennas including via SFSCN, and an existing infrastructure capable of providing space system command, control, and communications (C3). \n            \nThe WSF ECP sensor development will leverage current AFRL sensor and hazard assessment technology to accelerate availability of ECP sensor for integration on WSF-M and other planned SF satellite acquisitions.  The SF intends to transition AFRL's technology to industry for production via competitive award.  Two Tech Demo ECP sensors are projected to be delivered and ready for satellite integration by FY 2022.  Post-Tech Demo ECP phase, each respective program offices will be responsible for the procurement\/integration and sustainment of the sensors required to meet the SecAF's Space Situational Awareness (SSA) policy."

This effort will analyze and select the most promising technologies to move forward into system development and operations and a program of record (PoR).  DARC will augment the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) as an additional sensor with increased capacity and capability for deep space object custody at Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO).\n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the weapon system capability.

It will conduct a wide array of activities to model, integrate, test, and provide launch integration and support on-orbit testing of prototype technologies.  The supported activities include: systems engineering, technology planning, development, demonstrations and testing, as well as modeling, simulations and exercises to support the development and maturation of tactics and procedures.  This includes the development and prototyping of critical technology within the Department of Defense, across other government agencies, academic institutions and industry partners that are identified and the necessary systems engineering to effectively employ such systems.\n            \n            Specifically the SSPT project will include a cost-effective framework to identify, mature and transition demonstrations and prototypes to:\n            \n            - Rapidly address identified technology or capability gaps \n            - Accelerate the maturation of systems intended for demonstrations\/prototypes that enhance\/compliment\/replace an existing capability\n            - Support a more reliable, available, maintainable and survivable military space enterprise\n            - Energize the space industrial base supporting U.S. national security\n            - Focus S&T Innovation and facilitate its transition to military space programs of record\n            \n            This program includes efforts for Rapid On-Orbit Space Technology Evaluation Ring (ROOSTER), Tetra, Blackjack, and Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)-Hosted Payload (HP):\n            \n            ROOSTER is designated to provide a flexible orbit capability to host and deploy numerous prototypes and payloads utilizing excess payload margin available on US Space Force Headquarters (USSF HQ) launch missions.  \n            \n            Tetra will provide a training platform for operators to develop and demonstrate tactics, techniques and procedures for prototype missions. The experiment directly supports the evolution of U.S. space situational awareness and control. \n            \n            Blackjack is a joint technology demonstration project by DARPA and the Space Force to evaluate military utility and concepts of operation for a Proliferated Low Earth Orbit (P-LEO) satellite constellation.  The project leverages industry innovation in commercial P-LEO concepts by integrating military payloads onboard commercial commoditized satellite vehicles, demonstrating onboard data processing and autonomous tasking, and transmitting encrypted data through a mesh network of satellites in LEO with the goals of augmenting existing warfighter capability, increasing national security space resiliency, and decreasing per-unit satellite costs.\n            \n            QZSS-HP is a \"pacesetter\u201d hosted payload that is a high priority for the U.S. and Japan, paving the way for future Allied collaborations. It enhances Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) Space Situational Awareness capabilities over the Eurasian theater and facilitates resilient capabilities in the Space Surveillance Network (SSN).  \n           \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SSPT capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \n            This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

This includes technology development and prototyping for Defensive Counterspace (DCS) and Offensive Counterspace (OCS) and the necessary systems engineering for the warfighter to effectively employ such systems.  \n            \nSpecifically supported are DCS and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities which include developing threat warning payloads for monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing objects and events in space.  Additionally, this activity supports the development of payload prototypes and space defense force packages for protecting U.S. space systems, resources, and operations from enemy attempts to negate, interfere, or destroy them.  \n            \nSpecific OCS activities include disruption, denial, or degradation (and associated Electronic Support) of adversary space systems which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to immediate warfighter needs in the Space Control mission area are developed within this program.\n            \nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Space Control Technology (SCT) weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Threat development will very likely focus on jamming capabilities against dedicated military satellite communications (MILSATCOM).  To address this critical need, the Space Force is developing the Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) ground system to provide worldwide, anti-jam, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) communications for tactical warfighters. PTES will utilize the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) to provide anti-jam communications via military and commercial satellite systems for tactical users in all Services.  Initially, PTES will utilize the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) system and be expanded later to include commercial satellites and the Protected Tactical SATCOM (PTS) system.\n            \n            The PTES program is developing a mission management system (MMS), a key management system (KMS) and hub system to enable PTW via transponded WGS satellites, with future extension to commercial SATCOM.  Production-representative PTW modems for user terminals are being developed by the Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration (PTSFD) and will be separately acquired by each Service and by international partners.   \n            \n            To meet the warfighter requirements for protected tactical MILSATCOM and the capability gaps identified in these studies, RDT&E funding is required for architectural development, acquisition strategy development, system requirements and system trades analysis, and engineering, manufacturing, developing, testing and evaluating PTES systems and segments.\n            \n            The PTES rapid prototype addresses an urgent operational need in the Pacific region by achieving Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2023.  IOC provides ground elements for PTW over WGS and consists of PTES installation at two WGS Gateway sites utilizing one WGS satellite.  The Navy Wideband Anti-Jam Modem System (WAMS) relies on PTES to provide PTW ground infrastructure. The Space Force is utilizing FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 804, Middle Tier of Acquisition for Rapid Prototyping authority to deliver a PTES Operational Demonstration meeting the Navy's Minimum Viable Product in 2022. At Full Operational Capability (FOC) PTES will provide worldwide PTW operations using up to all WGS satellites.\n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver PTES weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \n            This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

                                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1206761F, Protected Tactical Service (PTS) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1206761SF, Protected Tactical Service (PTS) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 04 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe global threat of electronic warfare attacks against space systems will expand in the coming years in both number and types of weapons. Threat development will very likely focus on jamming capabilities against dedicated military satellite communications.  To address this critical need, the Air Force is developing the Protected Anti-jam Tactical Satellite Communications (PATS) family-of-systems, of which the Protected Tactical Satellite Communications (PTS) program was a New Start in FY 2018 to fulfill the highest level of anti-jam capabilities to mitigate adversarial jamming effects. PTS provides worldwide and polar, beyond-line-of-sight, Anti-Jam (AJ), low-probability-of intercept communications in benign and highly-contested environments utilizing the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW). PTS, with its on-board payload processing and antenna design, enables reliable tactical satellite communications within close proximities to adversarial jammers. The system also employs interfaces consistent with United States Space Force's on-going resilience initiatives and Enterprise Ground Services (EGS); thereby enhancing mission assurance, resiliency, and interoperability.\n            \n            The Space Force is utilizing FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 804, Middle Tier of Acquisition for Rapid Prototyping authority and Section 815, Other Transaction Authority (OTA), to achieve an affordable, rapid, operational capability for the tactical warfighter. This strategy employs spiral payload development to progressively and incrementally deploy prototypes with residual capabilities demonstrated in an operational environment. These spiral payload prototypes demonstrate innovative anti-jam technologies with modular and scalable payloads to meet validated military needs for protected tactical communications. This includes technical baseline development, systems engineering trade analyses, internal\/external system integration and development, candidate system architecture evaluations, risk reduction demonstrations, prototyping concepts development, system testing, and enabling technologies maturation.\n            \n            PTS includes a space segment, ground segment and gateway segment. For the space segment, the Space Force strategy utilizes a payload-centric focus to enable an affordable, resilient space architecture. This enables hosting and rideshare opportunities with other US government, commercial, International Partner satellites or integration onto a commodity satellite bus. For the ground segment, PTS leverages the EGS for satellite command and control, and the Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) rapid prototyping activity for mission and key management planning. The PTS gateway segment enables tactical warfighters reach back to global DoD Information Network. The PTS user terminal segment, not included in this PTS acquisition, will be procured by the military Services utilizing low-cost PTW modem upgrades enabled by the Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration technology demonstration program.\n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver PTS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n           \n            This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

ESS will meet the requirements for strategic communications and capability gaps identified in the Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the Protected Follow-on for Resiliency (PAFR) Study and the Strategic Tiger Team. The ESS architecture and functionality will be designed in accordance with the United States Strategic Command's signed ESS Concept of Operations and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's validated Capability Development Document (CDD) satisfying the legacy AEHF strategic requirements and mission performance with enhancements for increased resiliency and cybersecurity.\n            \n            ESS will support strategic mission requirements to provide the National Command Authority (NCA) and Combatant Commanders with highly-reliable, secure Military Satellite Communications. ESS will support the forecasted strategic demand in all operational environments and will be compatible with the existing architectures. The ESS system will satisfy emerging requirements using modular open system approaches to support incremental enhancements.\n            \n            For more rapid and resilient strategic capability risk reduction, the ESS Program Office is executing its approved Space Segment acquisition strategy that leverages Middle Tier Acquisition authorities from the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 for rapid prototyping, while maintaining the continuity of the AEHF strategic mission.  \n            \n            Activities for the ESS ground segment acquisition includes evolving and enhancing existing ground segment, space-to-ground segment integration, and modernization in support of Enterprise Ground Services compatibility, in accordance with the acquisition strategies and schedules. \n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ESS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \n            This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

A rapid prototyping phase effectively replaces the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase from a traditional acquisition under Department of Defense 5000 series Directives and Instructions. This approach will award up to three contracts in FY 2020 to focus on reducing space segment risks with the objective of maximizing ESS demonstrated capability for the payload and other key technologies. An ESS Program Office-led RFP and source selection will determine which space prototyping contractor, via their performance during the rapid prototyping phase, is positioned for the space segment Build, I&T and Delivery follow-on. The space prototyping contractors will be carried through the follow-on (Build, I&T and Delivery) source selection to continue momentum until the follow-on contract is awarded.\n            \n            Return on investment from space prototyping will energize the industrial base and increase competition in strategic SATCOM; inject innovative technical, process and integration approaches; burn down risk early and identify\/correct issues as early as possible; and decrease traditional fielding timelines to support a more resilient and responsive architecture against emerging threats. Success in the competitive rapid-prototyping determines and informs follow-on Build, I&T and Delivery.\n            \n            The initial Ground Segment Acquisition Strategy was approved by the Program Executive Officer (PEO) in 4th Quarter FY 2019 to begin early technology readiness studies for ESS Phase 1 Mission Planning in FY 2020.  Final approval for Mission Planning to begin architectural design and development\/production may require additional approval and authority designation by the MDA. In-Band and Out-of-Band Command and Control studies are underway to best evolve these systems that are currently under sustainment.\n            \n            A Space Segment Payload ECU acquisition strategy will be delivered to the PEO for approval in FY 2020."

Key operating principles include a short and narrow chain of command, overarching programmatic insight, early and prominent war fighter involvement, and small integrated teams within a single office to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed, to expand operational capability, reconstitute\/replenish\/protect critical space capabilities to reserve \"continuity of operations\" capability, and exploit space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage. \n            \nThe Space RCO is ready to develop, test, train, and equip war fighter needs as they are identified at any time. First, the requirements must be validated by the commander, USSTRATCOM, acting through U.S. Space Command; second, the project must be approved by the Space RCO BoD; third, the project will be executed by the Space RCO. If the effort is initiated during execution year, it will be described in the next year's budget exhibit.\n                        \nSpace RCO is supporting the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) developed Space Solar Power project to collect solar energy and provide uninterrupted, assured, and logistically agile power to expeditionary forces operating in unimproved areas such as forward operating bases.  AFRL formulated the Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR) project to rapidly demonstrate this innovative technology via a series of Integrated demos and technology development\/maturation efforts.\n            \nIn addition, Space RCO will conduct studies and analysis for future programs to support the BoD.\n            \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Space RCO weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \n            This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

                                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1203269F, GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203269SF, GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 05 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three-dimensional positioning\/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec. 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.\n          \nThe system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under Program Element (PE) 1203164F), Space (funded under PE 1203265F, 1203165F, and 1203269F), and a Control Network (funded under PE 1206423F and 1203165F). The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. The user equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters (spherical error probable) worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support (DWMS); Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.\n          \nGPS IIIF delivers GPS III satellites beyond the first ten Space Vehicles (SVs) being delivered by the GPS III program (funded in PE 1203265F GPS III Space Segment). The GPS IIIF satellites maintain the same capabilities as the GPS III satellites, but also delivers significant enhancements to include: potential on-ramping of advanced PNT technology from efforts such as NTS-3,  backward compatibility, unified S-Band (USB) interface compliance, integration of hosted payloads including a redesigned USNDS payload, Laser Retro-reflector Arrays (LRAs), Search and Rescue\/GPS (SAR\/GPS), Energetic Charged Particles (ECP) sensor, and Regional Military Protection (RMP) capabilities that provide the ability to deliver high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals in specific areas of intended effect. Implementation of RMP into the GPS Enterprise requires integration with the ground and user segments, executed by the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX), along with the Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) programs, respectively. The SAR\/GPS payload provided by Canada fills a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. LRA, built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL), is a passive reflector that improves accuracy and provides better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of the LRA.\n          \nThis PE funds the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) of GPS IIIF SVs 11-12 (to include Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support efforts). This program includes risk-reducing simulators and systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS IIIF satellites.\n          \nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $15.835 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances\n          \nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS IIIF Space Segment weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

During this time, the MDA approved the second phase of the two-phased GPS III Follow-On acquisition strategy. Executed using funds in PE 1203265F, GPS III Space Segment, the Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessments conducted during FY 2016-2017 provided data and insight into contractors' GPS satellite production designs with emphasis on a mature navigation payload and production-ready designs. Phase 1 results affirmed the viability of a competitive approach for Phase 2. The Phase 2 strategy directed the Air Force to conduct a full-and-open competition for GPS IIIF space vehicles and specified the use of RDT&E funds to deliver SVs 11-12 and conduct associated NRE. In addition to SVs 11-12, the RDT&E effort will be comprised of developing risk-reducing simulators, support test equipment, and conducting the systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS IIIF. The Air Force awarded the contract to Lockheed Martin in September 2018 and began the 1-year CDR campaign in March 2019. Completion of CDR is scheduled for March 2020 followed by Milestone C in Q3FY20.  Upon Milestone C approval, the Space Force will procure SV 13+ via annual contract options exercised Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF) and Space Procurement, Space Force (SPSF) funds consistent with full-funding policy under an annual buy approach."

Mandatory funding obligations and progress payment withholds will cause the program to lag traditional expenditure benchmarks, painting an inaccurate portrait of overall program health."

As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed surveillance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering indications and warning on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. This program element fields, upgrades, operationalizes, operates and maintains Space Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA network while companion program element 1206425SF, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Funds also support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, and test & evaluation, and may include prototyping and technology demonstration.  Activities funded in this program element (1203940SF) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering.  \n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $13.784 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n         \nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or re-purpose capabilities.\n          \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Ground Based Optical Sensor System (GBOSS) capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \nThis program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

On April 11th 2016, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) updated ADM adding additional responsibility for CCS Block 10.3 Meadowlands.\n    \nCCS provides expeditionary, deployable, reversible offensive space control (OCS) effects applicable across the full spectrum of conflict. It prevents adversary Satellite Communications (SATCOM) in Area of Responsibility (AOR) including Command & Control (C2), Early Warning and Propaganda, and hosts Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to Urgent Needs. This program effort includes architecture engineering and studies, system hardware design and development, software design and integration, and testing and demonstration of capabilities to provide disruption of satellite communications signals.\n    \nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $4.156 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n    \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Counterspace weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n    \nBounty Hunter (BH) supports the Defensive Space Control of US systems in a specific AOR and provides the capacity to prevent effective adversary use of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I). Continuing annual agile development is needed to meet new user needs in an ever changing threat environment.\n    \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Bounty Hunter weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n    \nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

The SSAEM program provides the acquisition, development and launch\/on-orbit support of 18 space\/terrestrial weather sensors to COSMIC-2 partnership in coordination with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO). COSMIC-2 is launching six satellites in an equatorial, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with 3 SSAEM sensors in each spacecraft by FY 2019. The sensor types are Tri-Global Navigation Satellite System (Tri-GNSS) Radio occultation System (TGRS), Ion Velocity Meter (IVM) and Radio Frequency Beacon (RFB). The SSAEM sensors will address three distinct Joint Requirement Oversight Committee (JROC)-approved Category A weather gaps, specifically Gap #4 (Ionospheric Density), Gap #7 (Equatorial Ionospheric Scintillation) and Gap #12 (Electric Field), to provide additional space meteorological data to improve forecast capabilities and improve warfighter navigation\/communication capabilities.\n          \n          Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n          \n          This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WSF weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \n          This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

The SBSS Follow-On (SBSS FO) program will develop and deliver a system to continue providing space object surveillance from space post SBSS Block 10 End-of-Life. AFSPC and NRO have signed a Memorandum of Agreement partnering SBSS FO with an NRO program based on overlapping requirements. The new partner program is called SILENTBARKER. SILENTBARKER requirements are based on a Statement of Capabilities and upon the current Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Initial Capabilities Document architectural requirements focused on protecting High Value Assets. SILENTBARKER will provide the capability to search, detect, and track objects from a space-based sensor for timely custody and event detection.  Surveillance from space augments and overcomes existing ground sensor limitations with timely 24-hour above-the-weather collection of satellite metric data only possible with a space-based sensor and then communicates its findings to the Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC), National Space Defense Center (NSDC), and other classified users. This program element includes efforts related to SILENTBARKER, its integration into the broader space superiority architecture, and analysis and experimentation to ensure space-based space surveillance capabilities against the evolving threat.\n          \n          Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n          \n          This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n         \n          This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

SILENTBARKER anticipates Initial Launch Capability in FY 2022.  The SBSS FO Materiel Development Decision was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on April 5, 2016.  The Acquisition Strategy Panel was completed with the MDA on August 29, 2016.  To satisfy the SSA architecture needs, the SBSS FO program requirements combined with an NRO program and were updated in the December 2017 SILENTBARKER Statement of Capabilities.  The SBSS FO program remains a Space Force program, but will leverage NRO processes to fulfill SBSS FO space segment and telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) program segments in order to further National Security Space objectives.  Mutual investment for the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost enables the potential for a larger initial constellation buy and lower unit costs.  The Space Force and NRO are implementing the approach to meet mission processing requirements, develop the ground architecture, and extend capabilities in 2020 and beyond."

SATCOM provides survivable communications for Presidential support and nuclear command and control, and affords national and military leaders a means to maintain strategic situational awareness and convey their intent to the Joint Force Commander (JFC).  In order for the United States to maintain its asymmetric advantage of global space-based communications, the SATCOM enterprise must be prepared to \"fight SATCOM\" as a single enterprise through a Contested, Degraded and Operationally-limited (CDO) environment, prevent or withstand loss, and continue to deliver effects to warfighters.\n        \n        The Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) strategy is to evolve current and future SATCOM systems to meet the needs of an integrated \"Fighting SATCOM\" Enterprise, sustain the existing AEHF system capability, develop a more affordable and resilient SATCOM enterprise capable of meeting near term and emerging requirements, demonstrate technologies and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) that lead to a future Protected Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM (PATS) capability that provides tactical level Military SATCOM (MILSATCOM) users protected, anti-jam satellite communications while operating in a contested environment, and develop an integrated (Commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM and MILSATCOM) \"Fighting SATCOM\u201d Enterprise. PATS will provide tactical users significantly higher data rates than AEHF and a security architecture that enables forward deployed users to have protected satellite communications in scenarios where AEHF terminals cannot be deployed. \n        \n        Under this construct the SMI will: 1) Continue the Capabilities Insertion Program (CIP) to enhance the current AEHF constellation and Protected Communications performance, and improve system operational resiliency, 2) Invest in technologies and demonstrations (e.g. Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration (PTSFD)) that enable the future Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) and SATCOM programs by continued development of the Protected Tactical Testbed, and demonstrating resilient and affordable wideband protected technologies and CONOPS, 3) Demonstrate and develop a roadmap to evolve the current stove piped MILSATCOM Command and Control (C2) management system into an integrated \"Fighting SATCOM\" Enterprise, 4) Develop and demonstrate flexible terminal interface technologies with Services and SATCOM Terminal providers, and 5) Develop and demonstrate an improved integration of ground gateways and data networking with the space segment with the goal of providing seamless end to end SATCOM service for the warfighters in a CDO environment. \n \nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $7.224 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n      \n        Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\n        This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AEHF weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n                \n        This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

Blended developmental and operational testing is expected to include full environmental, blue, and red team testing prior to the production decision.\n        \n        \"Fighting SATCOM\" Enterprise intends to utilize the Middle Tier Acquisition Section 804 authorities to develop rapid operational prototype capabilities in blocks starting in FY 2021.  This work leverages the Wideband Communication Analysis (WCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Final Report (2019) and the Protected Satellite Communication Services (PSCS) AoA Final Report (2016).  Findings in both AoA reports identified the need for an enterprise approach to managing SATCOM in an aggregated architecture for both cost savings and the necessary responsiveness to counter evolving threats.  Market research has identified high Technology Readiness Level products; and prototyping demonstrated mature interfaces and architectures to enable rapid capabilities that are \"Fighting SATCOM\" Enterprise-aligned."

The host spacecraft and the polar communications packages took advantage of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.  The EPS Capability Development Document (CDD), approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in September 2006, is based on a two-package, hosted XDR program with operational availability in CY 2015 and CY 2017.  EPS is comprised of four segments: Payload, Ground Control, Gateway, and Terminal (acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office). Milestone B review was completed April 2, 2014.\n    \n    In FY 2019, the USAF and Norwegian Ministry of Defense signed the Arctic Memorandum of Agreement, which enforces the international collaboration with Norway to host two EPS-Recapitalization (EPS-R) payloads on Space Norway-procured spacecraft.  Beginning FY 2020, the EPS-R effort transferred from Program Element 1206434F, Midterm Polar MILSATCOM System to Program Element 1206432F, Polar MILSATCOM (SPACE).  In FY 2021, EPS-R continues to develop and acquire two Extremely High Frequency (EHF) payloads hosted on Space Norway-procured spacecraft and continues to upgrade\/modify the existing EPS Ground Control and Gateway.\n \nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $1.702 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n   \n    Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n    \n    This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Polar MILSATCOM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n    \n    Funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in PE 0605432F, Polar MILSATCOM (SPACE), and PE 1206434F, Midterm Polar MILSATCOM System.\n    \n    This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1206442F, Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E), Space Force, PE 1206442SF, Next-Gen OPIR from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 05 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\n1. Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) (Project 657009): SMI supports Next-Gen OPIR by assessing and demonstrating new technologies to better enable detection of emerging global missile threats and awareness of material obsolescence. Additionally, SMI supports space and ground design efforts focused on delivering affordable capabilities, maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing improvements, producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current SBIRS Program of Record (PoR) constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade space and improve the competitive environment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technology Maturation and Data Exploitation. The Demonstrations mature and demonstrate technologies with ground and on-orbit prototypes.  Demonstrations advance system performance and algorithms for tactical and strategic applications to enhance PoR capabilities.  Finally, demonstrations reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the current PoR. Technology Maturation assesses and addresses needs to support resiliency of PoR assets and future architectures that must respond to an evolving threat environment. Data Exploitation enables access to OPIR data sources to expand technical intelligence products, battlespace awareness processing, and data dissemination tools to support warfighters and other data users. \n\n2. Next-Gen OPIR Ground (Project 657106): Next-Gen OPIR Ground, also known as Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE), consists of Command and Control (C2) migration to the Space Force\u2019s Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), modernization of Mission Data Processing (MDP) to implement an open framework, and required development and\/or upgrades to Relay Ground Stations (RGS) to meet United States Space Command guidance on the current and future space domain demands. FORGE and EGS efforts combined will provide the flexibility and scalability to integrate new satellites, sensors, and capabilities more rapidly and efficiently in order to meet evolving threats and warfighter needs. The Next-Gen OPIR ground efforts enable cyber enhancements for both space and ground systems. EGS will introduce common ground services such as Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C); mission management; and automation. To support initial Next-Gen OPIR Space satellite launches without driving risks into the FORGE development schedule, the program will establish a risk reduction ground Next-Gen OPIR Interim Operations (NIO) capability based on a limited Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Block 20 solution that can be utilized if FORGE is delayed.\n\n3. Next-Gen OPIR Space: Next-Gen OPIR implements the direction of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 130-17, dated 21 December 2017, by developing the next generation of strategically survivable space-based missile warning OPIR platforms in both GEO and Polar orbits. This program is a transition from the legacy SBIRS to a program that will deliver improved core missile warning capabilities that are more survivable against emerging threats. The full Next-Gen OPIR constellation will consist of a minimum of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and Polar satellites in sufficient number to meet global warning coverage with no exploitable holes (5 GEO + 2 Polar) plus required backup for attrition or reconstitution reserves. The Space Force intends to acquire Next-Gen systems in block procurements. The Block 0 acquisition strategy consists of three GEO and two Polar satellites. The first GEO satellite is required no later than FY 2025 and the first Polar satellite is required in FY 2027. All five Block 0 satellites need to be on orbit by FY 2029. Follow-on blocks will be addressed in future acquisition strategies. \n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 0 GEO (GEO) (NGG) (Project 657120): The Program Office intends to acquire the NGG capability in two contract actions. Phase 1, awarded in August 2018, encompasses requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System CDR. Phase 2 will be awarded in FY 2021 for the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch, and early on-orbit test, through operational acceptance of NGG satellites 1-3.\n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 0 Polar (NGP) (Project 657121): The Program Office intends to acquire the NGP capability in three contract actions. Phase 0, awarded in June 2018, encompasses system and payload requirements analysis and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Requirements Review. Phase 1 will include design and development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System CDR. Phase 2 will be awarded for the manufacturing, assembly, integration and test, and early on-orbit test, through operational acceptance of NGP satellites 1 and 2.\n\nNext-Gen OPIR Space, Block 1 (Project 657122): The Space Force plans to acquire subsequent blocks in a competitive environment. The Block 1 satellites will be based on the Missile Warning and Missile Defense OPIR Capability Development Document (CDD), validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in May 2019. The Next Gen OPIR Block 1 program acquisition will begin in FY 2023 in time to deliver its first satellite by FY 2030.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n    \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Next-Gen OPIR weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n    \nThe majority of Projects under PE 1206442SF have been declared Section 804 Rapid Prototype efforts. This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because the majority of Projects are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

Additionally, SMI supports space and ground design efforts focused on delivering affordable capabilities, maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing improvements, producibility enhancements, and technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for space and ground architecture enhancements. SMI includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current SBIRS Program of Record (PoR) constellation, reduce production timelines, and reduce recurring production costs. SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded trade space and improve the competitive environment. The three major thrust areas under SMI are Demonstrations, Technology Maturation and Data Exploitation. The Demonstrations mature and demonstrate technologies with ground and on-orbit prototypes.  Demonstrations advance system performance and algorithms for tactical and strategic applications to enhance PoR capabilities.  Finally, demonstrations reduce program risks for future OPIR systems, whether new systems or evolutions of the current PoR. Technology Maturation assesses and addresses needs to support resiliency of PoR assets and future architectures that must respond to an evolving threat environment. Data Exploitation enables access to OPIR data sources to expand technical intelligence products, battlespace awareness processing, and data dissemination tools to support warfighters and other data users."

WFOV is ready for launch in FY 2021. Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and reduce risk for future architectures. The WFOV payload and bus are separate development efforts. The WFOV testbed program provides a bus capable of demonstrating on-orbit mission performance and mitigating the development risks for employing WFOV sensors. The testbed program will integrate, test, and launch a prototype WFOV payload with a government-owned free-flyer spacecraft.  The WFOV testbed will host the WFOV payload. As an integrated Space Vehicle, the WFOV system will prove on-orbit mission performance of WFOV sensors. The WFOV payload will provide the critical on-orbit data required to develop and validate WFOV algorithms, as well as on-board MDP throughput requirements for strategic missile warning. \n\nThe Block 1 Prototype (space vehicle) is under development and will be responsive to emerging missile types and threats to the current missile warning architecture as well as evolving threats to the enterprise. The Block 1 Prototype will inform future OPIR architecture to include those achieved by the Space Force, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other mission partners. The Block 1 Prototype has a Class-C mission assurance with a 3-5 year designed mission life. The Block 1 Prototype is targeting an initial launch capability beginning in 2025. The technology demonstrations will incorporate resiliency capabilities while advancing the state of the art performance technology. The demonstrations will focus on the rapid advancement, technology insertion, and launch of future generations of missile warning technologies. These assets will incorporate threat mitigation technologies and other resiliency features with the goal of demonstrating these technologies in ground and on-orbit. These demonstrations will facilitate tech insertion, validate technical performance, inform future OPIR requirements, and reduce technical risk to the enterprise."

The program office will collaborate with appropriate contracting agencies to support each individual effort. Data exploitation efforts in the laboratory and the Battlespace Awareness center will leverage existing external contracts, as well as new internal competitive contracts. Activities, such as SBIRS obsolescence and affordability enhancements to the existing satellite design, will leverage existing Program of Record contracts. Technology maturation and component prototyping and\/or qualification could leverage existing contracts. Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) and Other Transaction Authorities are planned in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) and other government agencies. Where practical, other efforts are competed. An SMC BAA will be used to acquire and mature high priority technology items. Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors will also be used to conduct and support studies. New technology, replacement components, and system designs will be acquired with government data rights to the maximum extent, allowing incorporation into future OPIR satellite production or system development. Contracting partnerships with other agencies will also be used to study, develop, demonstrate, and prove emerging capabilities. Funding in execution years will be realigned within the Next-Gen OPIR program element to respond to execution requirements. To accelerate contracting actions and program execution, a local SMC contract vehicle will be utilized for the OPIR Battlespace Awareness Center (OBAC) and government lab services."

FORGE and EGS efforts combined will provide the flexibility and scalability to integrate new satellites, sensors and capabilities more rapidly and efficiently in order to meet evolving threats and warfighter needs. The Next-Gen OPIR ground efforts enable cyber enhancements for both space and ground systems. EGS will introduce common ground services such as Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C); mission management; and automation. To support initial Next-Gen OPIR Space satellite launches without driving risks into the FORGE development schedule, the program will establish a risk reduction ground Next-Gen OPIR Interim Operations (NIO) capability based on a limited Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Block 20 solution."

The Next-Gen OPIR GEO (NGG) missile warning satellites enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches. Development consists of new payloads in a highly resilient bus, providing real-time persistent global infrared coverage to meet validated Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) requirements on current and future space domain demands.\n\nThe Program Office intends to acquire the NGG capability in two contract actions. Phase 1 awarded in August 2018 encompasses requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Critical Design Review (CDR). Phase 2 will be awarded in FY 2021 for the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch, and early on-orbit test through operational acceptance of  NGG satellites 1-3."

The first block, Block 0, consists of 3 Next-Gen GEO and 2 Next-Gen Polar satellites. The Next-Gen OPIR Space program has been declared a Section 804 Rapid Prototype effort under the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The first GEO satellite is required by FY 2025 and the first Polar satellite is required in FY 2027. All five Block 0 satellites need to be on orbit by FY 2029. The program office awarded two sole source contracts (one to a GEO prime and one to a Polar prime) under the authority of two Justification & Authorization documents. Next-Gen GEO Phase 1 was awarded in FY 2018, encompassing requirements analysis, design\/development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System Critical Design Review for SV #1. Next-Gen GEO Phase 2 will be awarded in FY 2021 as a modification to the Phase 1 contract. This will include material buys for SV #2 and #3, as well as complete the manufacturing, assembly, system integration and test, launch, and early on-orbit test through the delivery of GEOs 1-3 for operational acceptance of each space vehicle. The Block 1 satellites will be based on the Missile Warning and Missile Defense OPIR Capability Development Document (CDD), validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in May 2019. Funding in execution years will be realigned within the Next-Gen OPIR program element to respond to execution requirements."

The first GEO satellite is required by FY2025, and the first Polar satellite is required in FY2027. All five Block 0 satellites need to be on orbit by FY2029. The program office awarded two sole source contracts (one to a GEO prime and one to a Polar prime) under the authority of two Justification & Authorization documents. The Next-Gen Polar Phase 0 was awarded in FY 2018, consisting of requirements development and culminates in a FY 2020 SRR. Phase 1 will be awarded in FY 2020, encompassing requirements review, design, development, critical path flight hardware procurement, and risk reduction efforts leading to a System CDR for Next-Gen Polar Satellite Vehicles (SV) 1 and 2. Phase 2 will be awarded in FY 2022, encompassing build, integration, test, launch, and transition to operations for Next-Gen Polar SVs 1 and 2. The Space Force plans to acquire subsequent blocks in a competitive environment. The Block 1 satellites will be based on the Missile Warning and Missile Defense OPIR Capability Development Document (CDD), validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) in May 2019.

NSSL is a launch service, not a weapon system, which is primarily funded with production funds.\n          \n          This program, started late FY 2014, funds research and development activities and related studies, to include, but not limited to, items necessary to invest in new and\/or upgraded launch systems and associated launch facilities to meet NSS launch needs leveraging domestic commercial launch providers. The RDT&E program will also fund continued research and development activities, mission manifest capability development & future studies for emerging NSS launch needs. These efforts will inform for future launch service development initiatives in order to continue sustained industry competition for Phase 3 starting in FY 2025 and future procurements. \n          \n          The Space Force is investing in Launch Service Agreement (LSA) public-private partnerships for the development of new and\/or upgraded domestic launch systems with commercial launch service providers. The anticipated result is two domestic, commercial launch service providers that will meet all current NSS launch requirements. In addition, the Space Force is continuing a technical maturation program to address the highest risks for rocket propulsion system (RPS) and LSA development. Development of the required RPSs have continued under the LSA public-private partnerships. Future development to capitalize on new technology and innovations developed by industry may continue to utilize public-private partnerships. The Space Force will also be leveraging opportunities to integrate Department of Defense payloads on to launch services procured commercially or by other Government agencies (i.e. NASA) where excess margin is available.\n          \n          Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or re-purpose capabilities.\n          \n          This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NSSL system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \n          This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

Includes development, demonstration and delivery of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems. Provides a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing of space control mission systems and training operators in both realistic and relevant environments. Additionally, using an agile incremental development approach for range capabilities, this program develops test range assets for both the fixed node Space Range Operations Center (SROC) at Schriever Air Force Base and a deployable Signal Monitoring Unit capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises. The virtual range as part of the Family of Systems (FoS), called Advanced Threat Simulation Environment (ATSE) virtual range, is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission. ATSE integrates to a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into cyber, air, and space ranges for increased realism and complexity required to prepare space operators for real-world threats. This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training. Additionally, the STTR Next Space Orbital Engagement (OE) range risk reduction projects will analyze, prototype, and demonstrate potential range systems that are used to support the testing and training of new advanced development space systems, advanced training for space operator orbital engagement maneuvers and future exercises. These risk reduction activities will include on-orbit capabilities, ground components, communication between nodes, and other required infrastructure.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n          \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver STTR weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n          \nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $6.4B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  In FY12, as an AF pilot initiative, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&M to RDT&E, AF funds. \n            \n            SMC is authorized to employ approximately 1,897 civilian acquisition professionals providing the management, tools, and technical capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB 61 Air Base Group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with initiatives in response to the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  This program element supports both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $6.4B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities. In FY 2012, as an AF pilot initiative, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&M to RDT&E, AF funds.\n            \n            Program Element 1206398F, Project: 664281 Space and Missile Systems Center - Major Headquarters Activities (MHA) was established to improve overall performance, strengthen business operations, and achieve efficiencies, effectives and cost savings that can be transferred to higher priority needs.  PE adds approximately 75 acquisition professionals.  Funding in FY 2021 is transferred to PE 1206398SF. \n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. SMC is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  The small launch program complements the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program with multiple options to acquire dedicated spacelift and rideshare services for developmental, demonstration, and small operational space vehicles.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g., reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Space Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, aging surveillance, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research, development, prototyping, integration, and supplemental reliability of flight testing efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur and other fleet vehicles (e.g., updates to the Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System).\n            \nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Rocket Systems Launch weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

The program integrates, launches, and operates an optimally selected number of DoD-sponsored experiments consistent with Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) priority, opportunity, and funding.   STP missions provide a cost-effective way to flight test new militarily relevant space system technologies, concepts, and designs, providing a way to:  \n            \n            - Support the acquisition block development approach \n            - Demonstrate and develop responsive research and development (R&D) space capabilities \n            - Provide early operational capabilities to quickly react to new developments \n            - Perform operational risk reduction through direct flight test of prototype components \n            - Improve operational design by characterizing the space environment, event, or sensor physics proposed for an operational system\/system upgrade \n            - Develop, integrate, test, and acquire advanced payload support hardware for launch vehicles (LV), commercial launch services, and human-rated spaceflight vehicles\n            - Expand and leverage international opportunities to further access for the US and its allies' R&D payloads\n            \n            The Deputy Secretary of Defense Space Test Program Management & Funding Policy, issued in July 2002, reaffirmed STP as the primary provider of spaceflight for the DoD space research community.  The July 2002 policy statement also reaffirmed STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the International Space Station (ISS). \n            \n            Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified \/classified  enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanism to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new, or repurpose capabilities.\n            \n            This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver STP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n            \n            This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

                                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1201017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1201017SF, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force. \n\n$1.889M is included in FY 2021 in the request for Appropriation 3600, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Air Force, PE 1201017F; these funds should have been requested under Appropriation 3620 Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1201017SF. Justification and plans for these funds are included in RDT&E, AF, PE 1201017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), R-1 Line #301.\n\nThe missions of USSPACECOM and USSTRATCOM include establishing and providing full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. \n\nThe Nation's strategic C2 sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN developed and established a unified schema that integrates disparate Missile Warning\/Missile Defense (MW\/MD) data into a single, exposed data set, providing redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables existing radars and sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning, execution, and future program planning.\n\nGSIN directly supports USSPACECOM, USSTRATCOM and other Combatant Command and MAJCOM mission sets. GSIN meshes together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Repurposing these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. GSIN enables creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing realtime collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. GSIN also improves Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability and provides this data for the larger space order of battle capabilities. GSIN dramatically improves the ingestion of nontraditional, but readily available, non-US government and commercial data to the United States Space Force (USSF) satellite catalog. GSIN addresses NORTHCOM\/STRATCOM's signed Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) ST-0010 request for uninterrupted traditional and non-traditional sensor data integration and the Global Threat Characterization Assessment (GTCA) Operational Planning Team report. GSIN provides critical and unique data to the USSPACECOM SSA data repositories to facilitate the large Space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) suite of capabilities\/programs. Finally, GSIN provides Machine Learner and Data Analysis functions to optimize and operate situational awareness in the field.\n\nSpace Acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Global Data Integration (GDI) weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F,0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1203001F, Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals (FAB-T) CPT efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203001SF Family of Advanced BLoS Terminals (FAB-T) CPT from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe FAB-T CPT, FET and PNVC Integrator programs transitioned from AFPEO\/SP to AFPEO\/NC effective December 2018.\n\nThe FAB-T CPT project replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected, high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC). FAB-T will provide the new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne\/ground command posts via Milstar, and AEHF Satellites. FAB-T CPT terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar and AEHF satellite constellations. \n\nThe Force Element Terminal (FET) project provides secure, protected, and survivable communications for the strategic and tactical warfighter through airborne-based MILSATCOM terminals. The FET will provide the B-52 and RC-135 aircraft with worldwide nuclear and non-nuclear, survivable, anti-jam Low Probability of Detect (LPD)\/Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) data and voice communications. The FET will be interoperable with Milstar, AEHF, Enhanced Polar Systems - Recapitalization (EPS-R), and Evolved Strategic SATCOM (ESS) satellite constellations utilizing both Low Data Rate (LDR) and Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveforms. FET was designated as MTA Middle Tier Acquisition in Feb 2019. \n\nThe PNVC capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System. PNVC is the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) replacement capability which provides anti-jam, anti-scintillation, survivable, and endurable voice communications through the AEHF satellite system for national and strategic users. There are several components being developed and procured by other organizations that must be synchronized to expeditiously field the capability. The PNVC Integrator is responsible for end-to-end integration of these components, to include requirements traceability, end-to-end system testing, configuration and checkout activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identification of deficiencies in overall PNVC system capability, enterprise, and life cycle support for PNVC components. The AFPEO\/SP approved entry into the acquisition lifecycle as a post MS-A ACAT III Program of Record in January 2016. Starting in December 2018 PNVC Integrator is responsible the requests for funding of all program elements related to the Defense Information Systems and Agency (DISA) components of the PNVC System in accordance with FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Sec. 1661.\n\nIn February 2019, the AFPEO\/NC declared the PNVC Integrator an ACAT II Program based on the inclusion of DISA funding in the program budget.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver FAB-T CPT weapon system capability. The use of such program funds is in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon). The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon. Development and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals continued with Raytheon. The first Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015."

This Rapid Prototyping program enables FET to accelerate the nominal program development timeline in support of the accelerated USSTRATCOM-requested Initial Operating Capability.  FET will award a development effort in FY 2020 leading to a rapid production decision in FY 2023. The rapid Prototyping effort enables FET to rapidly develop, install, and obtain operationally-representative test data from early B-52 and RC-135 FET prototypes which will also have residual operations capability.  The overall development effort includes system design and build of sufficient test assets to allow for expeditious development, testing, qualification and integration support of the FET capability. FET will meet B-52 and RC-135 platform requirements to support USSTRATCOM's Strategic Nuclear Command Control and Communication (NC3) mission."

                                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1203110F, Satellite Control Network (SPACE) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203110SF Satellite Control Network (SPACE) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB & Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for over 170 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 490 satellite contacts\/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command & control. During FY 2019 the AFSCN supported 11 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $4.1B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. In FY 2019, the AFSCN supported 19 launches delivering $13.7B worth of satellites to their operational orbits. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence Community, and civil users. These efforts support cyber hardening, Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO-S) and and Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) activities for the space enterprise, as well as align with the evolving future space domain demands through Ground Enterprise Next (GEN) to include transmit and receive, and data transport.\n\nAFSCN Deficiency Resolution: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.  \n\nGround Enterprise Next (GEN): Provides the means to communicate with all future spacecraft through diverse communication networks. The program is pursuing more capable ground based antennas, space based communication links, augmenting the existing ASFCN with commercial and civil antennas, upgrading satellite scheduling to commercial standards, and developing infrastructure for long haul communications driven by increase in antennas, cyber security and resilience requirements.\n\nIn FY 2021, Defensive Cyber Operations Space (DCO-S) funds in PE 1203614F JSpOC Mission System moved to PE 1203110F Satellite Control Network to consolidate Space Force Space DCO-S development activities.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program \/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified \/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or re-purpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFSCN weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions and transitions designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs.  Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line in appropriation 3022, Procurement, Space Force, procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.\n\nThe objective of the MMSOC C2\/GSE environment is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&D, prototype and operational systems and to transition R&D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard hardware and software infrastructure to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&E of new satellite and C2 systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and legacy satellite missions."

Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Space Training Simulators develop and upgrades space training emulators using Standard Space Trainer (SST) to meet Space Mission Force (SMF) threat-based, advanced training requirements as well as funds connection to Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training networks. Finally, its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.  \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SIIRTD weapon system capability.

                                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1203182F, Spacelift Range System (SPACE) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203182SF, Spacelift Range System (SPACE) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space.  LTRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB\/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA. LTRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  LTRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, LTRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are designated as Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).\n\nLTRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing & Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.\n\nThe Space Force requires RDT&E funds to conduct digital data processing and transport prototype projects supporting Range of the Future (ROTF) launch operations. Funds will provide engineering and analysis to develop promising technology and validate LTRS architecture ability to meet the accelerating national launch requirement and introduce advanced data transport formats. These include demonstration of virtualized and remote data processing as well as dispersed and disaggregated flight tracking. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LTRS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production and Deployment Phase.\n\nPE 1203265SF funds GPS III and supports RDT&E of GPS III SVs 01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This program includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS OCX program.\n\nMission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch and post launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures and procurement of special support equipment.\n\nGPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet a congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchase to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY 2017. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with GPS OCX, supports MGUE testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.\n\nImpacts of the M-Code deployment include:\n-Compliance with The US Space Command Commander's mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for early M-code operational use and verification of NAVWAR effects.\n-Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.\n-Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and properly deployed.\n-Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE\/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding.\n\nThe feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded by this budget item will determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation.\n\nThis PE encompasses the GPS III (SVs 01-10) and MCEU."

The acquisition approach utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower-risk incremental delivery of mature technologies. This approach focuses on mission success and on-time delivery. The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new international civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system, and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV capability additions.\n\nRDT&E funding for SVs 11 and 12 is in PE 1203269F and PE 1203269SF, Project GPS IIIF. Procurement funding for SVs 13-32 is captured in PE 1203269F and PE 1203269SF, Project GPS IIIF.\n\nThe AF is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort is funded with AFRL's S&T funding and PE 1203265F, to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.\n\nOn 21 Jan 2017, PEO Space approved the Acquisition Strategy for the MCEU program. The MCEU acquisition strategy enables the GPS Enterprise to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter prior to GPS OCX delivery. MCEU will also support the scheduled operational testing of MGUE. MCEU will update the GPS control segment software, AEP, to allow for command and control, processing, and integrity monitoring of the M-Code signal. MCEU acquires this capability by using the existing GPS III prime contract vehicle to modify the operational AEP software.\n\nThe Air Force approved reinstatement of a previously deferred Key Support Area (KSA) on 10 Feb 2016. The MSTIC receivers currently under development will get a software upgrade to process M-Code data. This $7.96M project to procure the M-MSTIC receivers was funded through both O&M and SPAF funds in FY 2016-FY 2018. Performance monitoring, integration, and test will be conducted by the MCEU program and sustained under the Global Positioning Operations Support and Sustainment Division contract with Lockheed Martin."

SDA mission supports New Foreign Launches (NFLs) and Space Catalog maintenance to include space debris tracking.  CD will acquire through design, development, Integration, and test a modern architecture to enhance mission capability providing Warfighter and Stakeholder customers direct operational benefit.  CD utilizes Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I), University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) and Assistance and Advisory Services (A&AS) Contractors to support programmatic and technical activities.  Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Specifically,  the Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) Rehost program upgrades the CD system's radar back end mission data processing, radar management and control, and signal processing capabilities to a modern architecture that facilitates long term mission resiliency, cyber security, system viability, high operational availability, and rapid hardware and software development and deployment capability.  FY17 Above Threshold Reprograming (ATR) RDT&E funds were provided to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to accelerate the joint Air Force and MDA modernization program of the CD radar which opens the door for a non-traditional acquisition approach using an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement through the OSD Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) Organization. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver COBRA DANE's weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F. In addition to funds being used to modernize this back end of the radar, these funds will also be used for out-year planning of front end component modernization including enhancement of communication elements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1203913F, NUDET Detection System (SPACE) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203913SF, NUDET Detection System (SPACE) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 7 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable\/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space. USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.\n\nThe USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the Space Force, and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA\/NA-22 supplies USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the Space Force's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&T) activities on Space Vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below). DoD funds their contribution to the USNDS program in Program Element (PE) 1203913SF with Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Space Force (RDT&E, SF), Space Procurement, Space Force (SPSF), and Operations and Maintenance (O&M).\n\nUSNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified\nGEO host), and Space Test Platform (STP) 3. Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment, the RADEC Data Processor (RDP), and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the five deployable mobile ground segment survivable Ground Nuclear Detonation Detection System Terminals (GNTs), and the survivable\/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental, evolutionary acquisition approach.\n\nThe upgrades to the GNTs are the survivable\/endurable UGNT which are funded with RDT&E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable\/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar\/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The GNT supports ITW\/AA and NFM missions. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System Survivable (SBIRS) \/ Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW\/AA and NFM. The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the Mobile Ground System (MGS) mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced NUDET detection capabilities which meet survivable\/ endurable attack assessment requirements directed by the President, Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.\n\nThis budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas. Sensor integration for GPS III and GPS IIIF are funded in their respective PEs.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NUDET Detection System (SPACE) weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds is in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1203940F, Space Situation Awareness Operations, Project 67A017, Sensor Service Life Extension Program efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203940SF, Space Situation Awareness Operations, Project 67A017, Sensor Service Life Extension Program from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nSpace Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of  all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. SSA also encompasses the integration, exploitation and delivery of data sources to facilitate the battle management and command and control of space forces.  This program element fields, upgrades, modifies, modernizes, operationalizes, operates and maintains Space Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA Space Surveillance Network (SSN) while companion program element 1206425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in this program element (1203940SF) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering.\n\nService Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) are efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational SSA sensors. These SLEPs extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. In addition, the SLEPs themselves may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized. As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin SLEPs on additional efforts. These efforts may include prototyping and technology demonstrations.\n\nGlobal Sensor Watch (GSW) Program provides an integrated SSA Tip & Cue capability that implements a survivable architecture providing overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing event response, multiple level security processing of SSA data and automated cross-sensor tipping & cueing worldwide. Other efforts to support Battle Management Command & Control (BMC2) in space include developing & deploying advanced software algorithms to identify, acquire, characterize, and maintain custody of both space objects of interest and new foreign launches; enhancing space environmental monitoring solutions; optimizing commercial, intelligence community (IC) & Missile Defense Agency sensors to better support BMC2; developing & executing Joint Functional Space Component Command (JFSCC) exercises such as Combined Space Operations Center and National Space Defense Center Experimentation, Test and Training Initiative to test & optimize Space Control capabilities, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) development to increase probability of survival for blue assets, and refining requirements across the space enterprise; enhancing sensor performance to close the solar exclusion gap leveraging technologies such as optical daylight tracking and incorporating commercial & IC sensors; and improving legacy paths to support bi-directional machine-to-machine sensor communications enabling a more complete BMC2 capability.\n\nSpace Surveillance Telescope (SST) provides rapid un-cued search, detection and tracking of dim objects in deep space and offers enhanced capabilities addressing critical space situational awareness gaps. \n\nGround Based Radar Upgrades improves the sensitivity, search capabilities and CONOPS of existing ground-based SSA sensors to better support custody and fire control timelines.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $3.446 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nPrograms and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats.  Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 120639S2F and 1206398SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                        "val": "In FY 2021, PE 1206423F, Global Positioning System III - Operational Control Segment efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1206423SF, Global Positioning System III - Operational Control Segment from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 07 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) distribution system which operates through all weather. GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.\n\nProgram Element (PE) 1206423SF funds Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) for the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX), the upgrade to OCX called OCX Block 3F to incorporate Regional Military Protection (RMP), command and control functionality for GPS III Follow-on (GPS IIIF) satellites, and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI). OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations, and 4) integrate Department of Defense (DoD) information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. OCX Block 3F will upgrade OCX with new capabilities to synchronizes with GPS IIIF Space Segment capabilities. GPS EI is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.\n\nOCX funds support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, resolving obsolescence issues, test and evaluation efforts, and mission operations. These activities support upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to enable efforts to protect United States (U.S.) Military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds ensure OCX efforts meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities. \n\nOCX Block 3F will upgrade OCX with new capabilities to synchronize with GPS IIIF Space Segment and Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Increment 2 capabilities. This includes advanced concept development such as systems analysis, modernized control segment development, modernization\/deployment of 17 monitoring stations, mission planning development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, test resources, systems engineering required to meet the Government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification. OCX Block 3F will maintain backward compatibility to support the legacy constellation develop solutions necessary to command, control and monitor GPS IIIF, to include advance collection and integration of RMP high power regional M-code signals, rapid warfighter effects and support to GPS auxiliary payloads.\n\nThe GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments. The Government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, Allied, and commercial GPS users.\n\nThe GPS EI project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish critical integrating function with the three GPS enterprise material segments along with the logistics, operational and transition communities. The GPS EI maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops\/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further, GPS EI provides modeling, simulation, and technical analyses of impacts for Government directed enterprise level trades among the GPS segments leading\nto definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification. \n\nIn addition, the GPS EI project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities. Examples for Generation II include electronic protection; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection and additional civil signals. To accomplish this, GPS EI delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments. In this capacity, GPS EI is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.\n\nGPS EI's analyses guides Government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs. For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the GPS EI: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules; and conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS EI performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The Government owns the GPS Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the GPS EI team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances Government control, oversight and program accountability.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $6.448 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver OCX weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment and mission planning development, modernization\/deployment of 17 monitoring stations, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and test resources.\n\nOCX acquisition was established to: 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites; 2) incorporate situational awareness to support NAVWAR and signal monitoring; 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations; and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, technology development, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future JROC approved required capabilities. \n\nOCX Block 0 (through Iteration 1.5) is the Launch and Control System (LCS) intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the on-orbit checkout of all GPS III satellites. OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.\n\nOCX Block 1 (adds Iterations 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1 to Block 0) fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and civil signals (L1C\/A), military signals (L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the modernized civil signal (L2C) and the aviation safety-of-flight signal (L5). In addition, Block 1 will field the basic operational capability to control the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code), and the globally compatible signal (L1C). It also fully meets information assurance\/cyber defense requirements.\n\nOCX Block 2 fields the advanced operational capability to control the advanced features of the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code). Blocks 1 & 2 are being delivered concurrently as a result of the Oct 2016 Nunn-McCurdy review.\n\nOCX Block 3F will modify OCX Blocks 1 and 2 to field new capabilities in support of the GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) production program and incorporate Regional Military Protection (RMP) to handle future threats. OCX Block 3F will upgrade OCX with new capabilities to synchronizes with GPS IIIF Space Segment and Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Increment 2 capabilities. OCX Block 3F will maintain backward compatibility with the existing capabilities to support the legacy GPS constellation and integrate into Block 1 and 2 and future efforts to support GPS IIIF. The OCX Block 3F effort will develop solutions necessary to command, control, and monitor GPS IIIF spacecraft and include advance collection and integration of RMP high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals, rapid warfighter effects, and support to GPS IIIF auxiliary payloads (including Search and Rescue (SAR), Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS)."

In order to successfully execute these responsibilities, GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI) creates an enterprise architecture, integrates segment products, verifies the enterprise requirements are adequately met, develops and implements various Systems Engineering documents, defines methods of verification, conducts integrated system test and test analysis, develops and manages the Enterprise technical baseline which reflect multiple stakeholder requirements; Stakeholders include the Department of Defense (DoD), foreign governments, industry, and the general public, (through four public interface specifications). Furthermore, GPS EI ensures GPS capabilities meet the warfighter's, civil agencies', commercial entities', international treaties', and over four billion global GPS users' needs. Moreover, GPS EI is responsible for delivering a reliable PNT signal capability to military operators, the civil user community, and international partners. In addition, GPS EI validates the system performance in various mission threat scenarios during its development as well as, provides in-depth technical expertise to enhance government control, oversight and program accountability. GPS EI is also responsible for all aspects of schedule and technical alignment across the GPS segments (space, control, and user). \n\nMore specifically, GPS EI is responsible for technical baseline management, integration, synchronizing, testing, and verifying GPS III, OCX, Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE), M-Code Early Use (MCEU) and Contingency Operations (COps). Additionally, GPS EI is responsible for creating and managing plans that provide early exercise of the products under development, compatibility analysis, and inter-segment testing. The inter-segment tests are required to prove OCX interoperability with GPS III satellites and modernized user equipment. More importantly, it ensures backwards compatibility with GPS Block II satellites and legacy user equipment. The GPS EI also manages the process through which the JROC validated requirements are matured and flowed down to the system segments, while remaining consistent with various interfaces. This enables the GPS system to meet Title 10 of the USC, Sec 2281, mandated GPS capabilities, and various other obligations to the international community that provide inter-operable PNT signals. \n\nGPS EI also supports the Government Joint Program Office's GPS spectrum protection at international forums such as the International Telecommunications Union. Such support consists of advocating on behalf of the United States (U.S.) Government when negotiating with foreign partners. In addition, GPS EI provides technical expertise to maintain relationships with other U.S. government agencies that include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Departments of State (DOS), Transportation (DoT), Homeland Security (DHS), and Commerce (DOC). GPS EI Spectrum also ensures GPS priority for eight essential spectrum signals, including those required for civil air navigation and safety of life. Spectrum Protection prevents encroachment from commercial or foreign entities, which results in the preservation of warfighter's reliable signal. As a result, military operations and the integrity of the global economic infrastructure are protected.\n \nGPS EI also provides the GPS enterprise expertise in System Safety, Enterprise level System Security Engineering covering Acquisition Systems Program Security (i.e., personnel, industrial, operations, information, sensitive compartmented information, communication, and physical), Program Protection, Foreign Disclosure, Public Release reviews, Mission System Certification and Accreditation, and Enterprise Cybersecurity. GPS EI is accountable for the development, execution, and analysis of OCX, cybersecurity, and associated test cases necessary to deliver a secure operational system.\n\nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $6.448 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."

While this complex inter- segment integration is traditionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract, for GPS, this approach requires the government to be the integrator. To execute this responsibility, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) contractor. The GPS EI function of the SE&I contractor is currently funded within this PE. The SE&I effort was originally procured in 2007 through a full and open competition, as was the new follow-on SE&I contract awarded in 2015. The SE&I follow-on strategy builds in year over year cost reductions as requirements stabilize. In FY 2023, the GPS EI effort will transition from PE 1206423SF to PE 1203269SF."

The EGS capability will become the primary ground command and control (C2) suite of services for the Space Force Space Enterprise to meet evolving current and future space domain demands. EGS is based on Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 capabilities developed under the Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program. \n\nThe EGS C2 program will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program systems. EGS will focus efforts on the rapid development and deployment of tactical C2 services, developing and integrating on-premises and cloud infrastructure and laboratories at multiple sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cyber security development and implementation. Programs and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats. Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.\n\nOver the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) EGS will be developing and deploying C2 services and software applications that support transitioning legacy and new missions such as Missile Warning, Missile Defense, MILSATCOM, Space Situational Awareness and various classified and experimental satellites and missions to the EGS open architecture.  The modifications to core software applications provided by EGS are being made in an Agile DevSecOps environment, which has been fundamentally designed into EGS since its inception. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThe program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EGS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Leverage the two SBIR Phase 3 contracts that were awarded in late FY 2019 to scale EGS capabilities and enable more rapid development and deployment of tactical C2 services to operational users."

The FY 2018 NDAA Sections 873\/874 directed OSD to streamline software development. Space Command and Control (C2) is an OSD pilot initiative in which all lifecycle funding will be tracked under BA08, Software and Digital Technology Pilot Programs. Pilot programs will test the ability to execute modern software development practices encompassing development, procurement, modification and maintenance activities. The Space C2 pilot program in PE 1203614SF, RDT&E, Space Force, BA08 includes funds transferred from PE 1203614F, JSpOC Mission Systems (RDT&E and SPAF), Air Force and Operations and Maintenance, Air Force.\n\nThe Space Force is developing a Space Command and Control (Space C2) and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capability for the Combined Force Space Component Commander (CFSCC). The enterprise-wide system will provide a common government infrastructure and standards for rapid prototyping of dynamic SSA and Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) applications to address the evolving and dynamic threat. The system will provide a collaborative environment that will enhance and modernize SSA and BMC2 capabilities; create decision-relevant views of the space environment; rapidly detect, track and characterize objects of interest; identify \/ exploit traditional and non-traditional sources; perform space threat analysis; and enable efficient distribution of data across the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). Funding includes technical studies, development, experimentation, integration and related support costs.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis Program Element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Space C2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in Program Elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF."

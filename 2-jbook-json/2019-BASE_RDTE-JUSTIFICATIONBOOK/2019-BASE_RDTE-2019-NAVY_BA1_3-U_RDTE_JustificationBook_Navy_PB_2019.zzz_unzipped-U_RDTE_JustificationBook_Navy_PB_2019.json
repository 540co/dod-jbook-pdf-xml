Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress, and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The DURIP project supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation project complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research\ninstrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The PECASE project supports single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This project provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national\nsecurity."

The Department of the Navy (DON) component responds to S&T directions of the Naval Research and Development Framework for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.\n\nThis PE addresses DON Basic Research, which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention. Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated in thirteen Naval Research and Development Framework focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet\/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.\n\nThis portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.\n\nIn-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers\/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in PE 0601152N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the Department of Defense is managing its basic research program effectively."

It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Research and Development Framework. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  \n\nThis PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences. Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend. There are currently five NNRs.\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge Program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program. The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and collaborative departmental efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science that attract new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science & Technology Strategy. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  \n\nThis PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences. Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support. Activities in this area also support maintenance of the Science and Engineering Workforce and STEM Education and Outreach.\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), S&T areas that are uniquely important to maintaining U.S. Naval superiority. With the designation in 2011 of Sea-Based Aviation as an NNR, there are currently five NNRs.\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and collaborative departmental efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science that attract new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Naval Expeditionary Forces need science advances to address a range of Basic Research challenges that result from physical and operational environmental limitations so harsh that solutions push basic discovery and invention. Naval Forces able to operate amphibiously and in the littoral will have all of their capabilities exposed to degrading sea and land physical effects. Expeditionary forces operating austerely must be agile and lethal but will be constrained by size, weight, and power requirements and must be sustained across distributed forces covering large areas. Further complicating the problem context is the nature of hybrid threats, and adversaries. \n\nA hybrid adversary can be state or non-state using a combination of conventional and irregular methods and weapons. For example a hybrid threat could use criminal acts in concert with conventional artillery and IEDs and in turn social media for combined effects greater and broader than the sum of the parts. These coordinated multivariate threats occur across the spectrum of conflict with a dynamic but unified strategy. A hybrid adversary is flexible and adapts quickly, synchronizing advanced state weapons systems, disruptive commercial technologies, cheap expedient homemade weapons, and a variety of tactics. The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats program seeks to establish and nurture science to address these threats not covered in more conventional warfare science efforts and in environments not researched elsewhere.\n\nWithin the above threat and environmental context numerous warfighting capability dependencies are considered resulting in a broad range of science research areas. Examples include: physics addressing the electromagnetic spectrum for use in Command and Control and high energy physics addressing Directed Energy Weapons; machine perception, reasoning and collaborative behaviors of autonomy enabling numerous potential expeditionary autonomous systems; artificial intelligence enabling future Intelligence systems; optics, electronics, and photonics research to enable revolutionary spectral awareness in small low power sensors; computer and network science to enable expeditionary computing coupled with Data Science research to conduct data analysis; fundamental chemistry and materials science research to advance technologies to support sustainment; basic materials research to explore and improve armor and structural materials; electrochemical energy conversion and storage research to sustain the force; chemistry and physics to provide disruptive energetics for expeditionary Fires; and biology, physiology, and cognitive sciences addressing the Naval Expeditionary warfighters human abilities.\n\nThe program also seeks to establish and nurture a multidisciplinary Science and Technology community of Government, academic and industry researchers to accelerate the transition of new science and technology into fielded systems.\n\nAccomplishments and plans described below are examples for each effort category."

S&T efforts will address multi-faceted threats that employ both conventional and unconventional forces. This activity was originally formed to address Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Sciences, which are a component of Complex Hybrid Warfare Threats. However, there are additional emerging components of complex hybrid threats that must be addressed with these efforts as well as the challenges imposed by Naval Expeditionary Operations and as such the PE will address a broad range of hybrid threats not only IEDs and the science challenges associated with these environments. This activity will also incorporate Expeditionary Operations activities to facilitate the consolidation described above.\n\nComplete basic materials research to explore and improve high strain and stress rate performance of high performance fibers, armor inserts, and structural materials. Complete fundamental chemistry and materials science research to advance water purification technologies. Complete basic research to advance electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Initiate Investigations into novel hybrid devices, making use of the optical, electrical, and acoustic regimes. These devices will enable photonic and electronic domain access and manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum across multiple octaves of bandwidth. Such devices will enable previously-unattainable real-time spectral awareness and performance. Initiate basic research to advance machine perception, reasoning and collaborative behaviors of autonomous systems during Amphibious Operations.\n\nExtramural C-IED Science\n\nComplete investigations into challenges in the temporal domain in various land environments.  Complete the program to investigate nano-technologies applied to miniaturized remote molecular sensors, with an additional emphasis on low fidelity detection of trace explosive vapor partial-pressures.

Carry out a multidisciplinary field effort to characterize and understand monsoon intra-seasonal  variability in the Indian Ocean. Finish analysis from a study of the structure and variability of the Northern Arabian Sea circulation using autonomous, unmanned sampling systems.\n\nExtramural Littoral Geosciences and Optics\n\nComplete all efforts from previous fiscal years. Initiate development of methodologies and\/or observing technologies which are: a) nimble, cost-effective, rapidly re-locatable, or will offer bold insight into littoral dynamics, or b) utilize sensors on operational platforms (termed organic) in ways which increase battlespace awareness or can be used to map the maritime domain while idle. Initiate studies and modeling of shelf, near-shore, delta, estuarine, and riverine dynamics, including surface and internal waves, currents, stratification, sediment transport and the seabed response and coastal winds driving shallow water response. Understanding shallow water features which will affect acoustic propagation or acoustic system performance and\/or events which cause swimmer or navigational hazards (bathymetry-wave-current-wind interactions), navigationally significant bathymetry or trafficability changes, are of particular interest. Initiate studies using remote sensing of the coastal and riverine environment, above and below the sea surface and canopy, e.g., from EO, IR, radar, SAR, inSAR and acoustic, from land or ship-based, unmanned vehicles, airplanes or satellites. New remote sensing tools and algorithms that can be used to initialize forecast models in distant, remote and\/or denied areas are of particular interest.  Initiate studies of optical processes in the littoral environment, including the atmosphere, sea surface, water column, sea bed and suspended or dissolved materials. Predicting the timing (initiation, transport and clearance) of materials that negatively affect optical clarity, is of particular interest.\n\nExtramural Marine Mammals and Biology\n\nIntegrated Ecosystem Research - Conduct basic research to understand the patterns and causes of variability in the distribution and abundance of marine mammals over space and time. Initiate a multidisciplinary approach using tagging, visual surveys, and passive acoustics to collect baseline measures of marine mammal behaviors and distributions relative to environmental features and marine mammal prey fields. Investigate using animal tagging and passive acoustic monitoring to study behaviors and distributions of marine mammals relative to key environmental properties (biotic and abiotic).  This includes providing a context for interpreting behavioral responses to external stimuli (i.e. anthropogenic sound), and providing basic knowledge needed for predictive models of species of concern.\n\nEffects of Sound - Conduct basic research on behavioral, physiological (hearing and stress response), and potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Initiate research to characterize the causal chain of events leading from sound exposure to \"biologically significant\" behavioral reactions that might increase risks of population-level effects and\/or the potential for stranding. An additional focus is to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Conduct research into the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Initiate research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and\/or bodies.  Another research focus is better understand the stress response in marine mammals to sound exposure. Conduct research to develop an understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize the relationships among hormones or other biomarkers in different matrices, define and compare the quantitative and temporal relationships of hormones across the different matrices, and evaluate and characterize the relationship between the physiological stress response in marine mammals and acoustic exposure and 'biologically significant' disturbance. Continue research to develop statistical models of the population consequences of acoustic disturbance to be fitted to data from marine mammal populations and lead collaborative development of transferable models of the effects of disturbance on marine mammals.\n\nMonitoring and Detection - Conduct research to develop and test new and existing technology to detect and classify marine mammals in the marine environment and during periods of low light such as passive acoustics, and IR. Continue research and development of passive acoustic signal processing algorithms for detection, classification, and localization of marine mammals. Continue the development and testing of autonomous hardware platforms using passive acoustics and\/or IR to detect and classify marine mammals using a variety of fixed, towed, floating, and profiling platforms.\n\nExtramural Ocean Acoustics \n\nConduct research to understand propagation and scattering of acoustic energy in shallow-water ocean environments.  Areas of research include: shallow-water scattering mechanisms related to reverberation and clutter; seabed acoustic measurements supporting geoacoustic inversion; acoustic propagation through internal waves and coastal ocean processes and the development of unified ocean\/seabed\/acoustic models, including scattering from rough surfaces, biologics and bubbles; and penetration\/propagation within the porous seafloor.\n\nIntramural Battlespace Environments\n\nThe overall objective of this research is to improve basic understanding of physical, seafloor and biological oceanographic processes on space and time scales of naval interest. Emphasis is on improved measurements, laboratory and model based experiments to quantify and understand important oceanographic processes that lead to the development of ocean dynamic models from global to submesoscale scales, and to couple these oceanographic models with atmospheric, ice, biological, sediment response, and optical models. Surveillance of coastal land areas and waters is important to support Navy operations and difficult. The Navy\/Marine Corps needs include an improved use of overhead (airborne and satellite) active and passive microwave sensors, overhead optical sensors, surface-based (ships and ground-based) grazing angle microwave sensors. To predict bottom boundary physical, geological, geochemical, geoacoustic and geotechnical properties in shallow-water operating areas requires:  a) an improved understanding of processes that generate and modify the shape, structure and physical properties of the seafloor, subseafloor, ocean water column and ice-cover and topography\/morphology;  b) use of rapid, airborne characterization of littoral environments including time-varying coastal topography, littoral bathymetry, sea-level height, land and seafloor sedimentary structures to explain\/predict the observed changes; c) remote sensing of bulk properties of Arctic sea-ice over broad two-dimensional areas that previously could be sampled only at spot locations by in-situ sampling; and d) quantification of the influence of turbulence generated at the seafloor boundary layer on vertical mixing and stratification in shallow water outside the surf zone."

It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment. Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia\/industry team. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively."

This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies.

These\nscientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.\n- Continued studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and including studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions. These scientific studies are critical to understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapons systems and interfaces.\n- Continued trade studies on innovative solid state laser subsystems designs, based off industry available technologies or those technologies identified by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO). These investments will be considered \"break through\" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system.\n- Continued scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance against key performance parameters.\n- Continued scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent \"safe-arm\" function for the projection of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.)

Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and\/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. \n\nThe metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational\/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments\/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational\/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass\/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development\/demonstration program."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nThis PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This also includes predictive capability of cavitation inception, thrust breakdown, and erosion phenomenon and scaling laws. Technology efforts in the area of Subsurface Hydrodynamics include identifying, understanding, predicting, and controlling flow physics, as well as turbulence and stratified wakes.  This is further applied to Subsurface Maneuvering Technologies, and understanding the Dynamics of Interacting Platforms. Additionally hydrodynamic technologies focused on the signature aspects of the hull-propulsor interaction and maneuvering.\n\nPlatform Structures: Focused on time-varying, structural reliability analysis and prediction for a ship structural system with uncertainty quantification and propagation. Specific topics include novel structural configurations across composite and metallic materials and prediction methods for advanced global hull strength, local panel and component strength, fatigue and fracture strength, and seaway loads and load effects for high-speed\/high-performance ships and vessels.  Hull life assurance addresses development of new structural system approaches for surface ships and submarines, including the management of weapons effects to control structural damage and the improvement of structural materials.\n\nUnmanned Surface Vehicles (USV): Autonomy for USVs and related mission functions aligned with Naval S&T strategic focus on autonomy and unmanned vehicles. Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicle (USSV) applied research includes short-term motion forecasting for recovery of USSVs on a host ship in higher sea states and determination of slamming loads on high-speed planing hulls for structural weight reduction Distributed intelligence for automated survivability addresses both the basic technology of automating machinery control systems, as well as, distributed control of systems utilizing autonomy for mission context based reconfiguration.\n\nSea Platform Survivability Technology:\nAligned with survivability S&T strategic focus area, research investigates electromagnetic (EM) sources (including major ferro and non-ferromagnetic sources, eddy currents, and Corrosion Related Magnetic Fields (CRM)) that are associated with naval platforms.  Develop understanding of EM field propagation relationships and analysis aids, and technologies to predict the electromagnetic properties of a naval platform.  Advance physics based understanding of platform acoustics. Discover and develop algorithms and methods that will enable the development of improved design, analysis, and prediction tools for enhanced acoustic performance.

Research efforts are carefully selected to ensure they have the potential to expand warfighting capabilities, inform operational concepts and requirements development, and advance state of the art technology and scientific knowledge.  Current guidance also highlights the need to accelerate our pace of development and guide the approach to rapid experimentation, prototyping, and learning.\n\nAs reflected in the Marine Corps Operating Concept, the current strategic guidance from the Commandant, expeditionary forces will conduct maneuver warfare in environments characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information used as a weapon, a battle of signatures, and an increasingly contested maritime domain. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. \n\nThese future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting size, weight, power, cost (SWAP-C) limitations, and information availability within distributed, intermittent and limited (DIL) environments. \n\nThe approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both \"push\" and \"pull\" aspects of technology projects. Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyber attacks.\n\nTechnologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to SWAP-C constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment."

The portfolio protects against adversaries' challenges such as guided-rockets and missiles, mobile coastal artillery, threat EW, and counter-ISR. Mines and obstacles both in the water and ashore also complicate amphibious landings. The activity invests in vehicle survivability aspects that are exacerbated due to SWAP-C constraints inherent to Marine Corps operation and the harsh nature of the amphibious environment. \n\nTechnologies addressed include lightweight armor for ballistic and underbody blast protection, advanced sensors for counter tactical surveillance, active protection, and signature management. This activity also considers technology for payloads, packages and sensors that are needed by amphibious vehicles (both manned and unmanned) including mine counter measures; explosive hazard defeat systems; and obstacle and threat detection systems as well as technologies for improved protection for individuals against blast, ballistic and blunt impact threats."

The objective of the work in this PE is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0602750N Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research, where the Navy's participation in the FNC Program is funded.  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, are being resourced in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD).  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in this PE.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces. \n\nPrior to FY19, the underlying FNC Program investments in this PE were aligned to specific FNC projects.  In order to increase agility, exploit technology advances, and respond quickly to naval needs, future applied research investments supporting FNC technology candidates are being developed in a more flexible manner. This approach facilitates an optimum response when developing and maturing the technology options that will be developed further in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD). The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Investments are organized to enhance collaboration with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors.  A complete accounting of the technologies being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort referenced as continuing in the FY18 plans of this PE will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&T investments. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered radio frequency (RF) spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and RF challenged environments.  \n\nThe current specific objectives are:\na) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic\/infra-red (EO\/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.\n\nb) Tactical Networking and Network Control\/Management: \nDevelop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.

The amount of data that the decision makers are facing today is much larger than any time before in human history.  In addition, the data is much more complex, heterogeneous and fast changing.  Analysis of such large and complex datasets is beyond the cognitive abilities of any single decision maker.  The aim of this thrust is to develop new methods for extraction and analysis of relevant information from large-scale datasets, and to develop new tools for distributed information sharing and decision-making.

It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.  \n\nThis PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities. Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the CNO and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. \n\nThis PE also includes the Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG) International Science Program whose mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet\/Forces (F\/F), and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission is the Naval Science Advisor Program that develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon tour completion, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first-hand knowledge of the F\/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. This program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort."

Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats.  The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area.  This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies.  Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept.  \n\nThe objectives reported in prior years under this R-2 Activity have been consolidated into the current objectives described below.\n\nThe current objectives are:\n\n- EW RF Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive\/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. \n\n- EW EO\/IR Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO\/IR) spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming\/steering, and signal processing and transmission. \n\n- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack.\n\n- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies: Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements.\n\n- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command & Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.\n\n- Starting in FY 2018, all Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments in Electromagnetic Maneuver Command & Control (EMC2) Warfare will be shown in the new INP PE 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research to better convey exactly what the Office of Naval Research is working on in this area.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

Technology developments to provide capabilities indigenous to small UASs are a significant focus.  Technology developments being addressed include laser based IR countermeasures, non-mechanical holographic means for optical beam steering for EO\/IR countermeasures, the development of new optical lens technologies based on gradient indexed (GRIN) optics. This latter technology when coupled with another ongoing effort in multidimensional optics show significant promise for greatly reducing the weight of highly capable optical systems.  Additionally there is a focus on developing the high payoff technology of chip scaled integration of optical photonic components with microwave components.   Technology is being investigated to determine the potential for being able to conduct specific emitter identification and classification relative to gun blasts using IR imagers.   \n\nRF efforts include work in developing engineered high transmit to receiver materials for significant improvements in isolation.  Work is ongoing to expand EW jamming capabilities at high power levels covering previously unaddressed frequency bands with significant operational impact.

An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. \n\nThis activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems.

The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through commercial off the shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.\n\nThe current specific objectives are:\n\na) High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.\n\nb) Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.\n\nc) Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nThis PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. \n\nThis PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space & Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the \"key transformational capabilities\" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed\nat understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.\n\nMajor efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the Battlespace Environment (BSE), determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems, and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations, maintenance, repair and upgrades that enable applied research at sea and provides modeling and analysis for environmental compliance for ONR\/NRL field work and active acoustic experiments. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.\n\nJoint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)\/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE."

Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity.

This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The littoral zone has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids."

This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement\/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve Anti-Submarine Warfare, Naval Special Warfare, and Mine and Expeditionary Warfare."

                        "val": "The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment.  These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.  \n\nThis program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nThis PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element , as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments."

Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and\/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components.

The objective of the work in this PE is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Navy and Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development.  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in this PE.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nThis PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea. This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three \"key transformational capabilities\" required by \"Sea Shield\" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within \"Sea Strike\" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric\/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection\/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization\/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These investments represent game-changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities. The projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future. The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to support further development. These investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nDeveloping INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts.\n\nThis PE was new for FY 2018 and it consolidated all Navy 6.2 investments funding INPs into a single Navy 6.2 PE. In FY 2017, these investments were spread across 4 separate 6.2 PEs: 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research, 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research, 0602271N Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research, and 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research. Accordingly, the projects in the portfolio are no longer distinguished as INPs or Leap Ahead Technologies. Rather, they are now referred to simply as INPs.\n\nDue to the nature of these projects, starting in FY19, plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs as existing ones are completed. Successful experiments and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities, requiring significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future. INPs have been collectively grouped into R-2 Activities that include Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy \/ Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber and Undersea Warfare.\n\nDue to the nature of these projects, starting in FY19, plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.

Conduct applied research addressing the unique technical challenges inherent in the construction, assembly and operation of an Electro Magnetic (EM) railgun prototype capable of launching long range projectiles repeatedly, many times per minute. Special materials and compact sub-system components will be developed that are capable of operating in harsh thermal and electromagnetic environments.  Advanced modeling tools will be developed to assess design options, analyze system concepts and inform experimental hardware design and testing.  Develop and test next generation battery energy storage and pulsed power components to assess performance and applicability towards future designs. Develop and refine algorithms for controlling the precision timed electromagnetic pulse used to fire the railgun in the rep-rate mode. Conduct material, physics and thermal property research for long life, rep-rate electromagnetic launch systems and actively monitor performance to understand the high currents, elevated operating temperatures, and cooling of components, so as to improve designs and increase their reliability. Develop modeling and simulation tools that support electromagnetic launch, multi-shot life development, testing, and assessments, and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions.  The capability will electromagnetically launch a projectile with sufficient kinetic energy to travel significantly farther than traditional Naval gunfire.   \n\nHigh-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS)\nContinue HIJENKS, a joint USAF\/USN project previously funded as a FY17 jump-start effort in PE 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research. Develop a High Power Radio Frequency (HPRF) technology payload integrated on an air platform capable of engaging multiple electronic targets with a single, scalable effects weapon across a variety of warfighting missions.

The operational impacts include decreased cost exchange ratios, non-kinetic counter electronic effects, reduced collateral damage, and the ability to engage multiple targets with a single weapon. This effort aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. During FY18, the following applied research development efforts are planned: investigate Radio Frequency (RF) effects on complex electronic systems with the goal being to finalize an RF waveform specification; investigate HPRF weapons effects for non-kinetic counter electronics to include the prediction model improvements required for mission planning of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW); perform Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to capture RF antenna output, RF propagation, RF interaction with complex enclosures, and RF interaction with electronic circuits to characterize DEW performance to the maximum extent possible; conduct research into the time-out of action or recuperation time for complex electronics, exploring Battle Damage Indicators (BDI)for electronic disruption; determine the critical pulsed power and RF components required to reduce the HPRF payload's Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP); perform a trade-off analysis of the technology alternatives, their maturity, and their suitability for this application; develop the most promising component technologies, such as conformal antenna designs for high power, advanced high power RF source technologies, pulsed power components with higher energy densities, and advanced architectures and magnetic materials for high voltage power electronics systems; conduct risk reduction research for the RF source and antenna subsystems by examining high risk, high payoff technology alternatives to improve output power while simultaneously reducing system size and weight, and examine the efficiency of each subsystem and the impact of overall payload prime power requirements.\n\nSolid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM)\nComplete the BA2 portion of SSL TM, which was previously funded in PEs 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research.

The\nAACUS project will complete research efforts to develop and mature technologies that perform autonomous take-off, conduct en-route navigation, classify the terrain of landing zones, detect and avoid ground-based obstacles, and safely operate in degraded visual environments. In addition to maturing these individual technologies, specific attention will be directed toward the task of integrating them into a full scale autonomous platform to increase their technology readiness level.\n\nClaws\nContinue Claws. Claws, which was previously funded in 0602747N Undersea Warfare applied Research will develop the autonomy required to operate large and extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in an anti-access, area-denial environment. To support large and extra-large UUV operations further forward and farther from the battle group, the technology will be evolved to allow operations with limited navigational fixes and limited communication opportunities. During FY18, research will be conducted and technology will be matured in the areas of precision navigation, obstacle avoidance, robust communications, on-board vulnerability assessment, and payload autonomy. Applied research efforts in advanced undersea autonomy will also be initiated.\n\nLarge Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV)\nComplete the LDUUV project, which was previously funded in 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research. The LDUUV INP is developing the critical technologies of energy, autonomy, endurance, and submarine launch and recovery. These critical technologies are needed to enable Large UUVs to be pier and ship launched, and recovered. The technologies will enable the completion of missions with long ranges, as well as those requiring over 60 days of endurance for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) tasks. Continue development of the long endurance, air-independent energy source technology for large UUVs. Continue development of the autonomy technology that will support operation of the UUV in the littorals. Continue development of core UUV technologies that will extend the reliability and endurance of the UUV operating in the littorals. Conduct a UUV fuel cell systems technology analysis, which will be used to support a land-based demonstration.\n\nLow-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)\nContinue the LOCUST project, previously funded in PEs 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research and 0602123N\nForce Protection Applied Research. LOCUST will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of\nmilitary operations and areas of operations. LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses. This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution. The applied research effort in 2018 specifically will conduct preliminary system design and technology developments within the three major LOCUST sub-systems: (1) the Distributed, Collaborative, Coordinated, & Cognitive autonomy system architecture; (2) the distributed Command & Control system architecture; and (3) a series of modular UAV payloads.\n\nLarge Displacement UUV - Advanced Power and Energy Demonstration (LDUUV-APED)\nContinue LDUUV-APED, which was previously funded in PE 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research. The\nLDUUV-APED Program is integrating the Aluminum Power System (ALPS) air-independent fuel cell system into an existing LDUUV vehicle and conducting at-sea testing to demonstrate a mission endurance capability that meets the Navy's UUV far-term objectives (up to 70 days) for a persistent forward presence. During FY18, the hull structural design and analysis will be completed and the energy section hull will be fabricated. Integration of ALPS into the energy section hull will begin. Modifications to the vehicle to accept the ALPS energy section will begin. The notional mission profiles will be finalized and development of the test plan will begin. The vehicle-level hazards analysis will be completed and the range approval process will continue to be supported.\n\nMedium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV)\nContinue MDUSV, which was previously funded in 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research and PE 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research. The MDUSV project will continue research efforts to develop and mature technologies in multiple areas that will be used to assess the feasibility of an MDUSV to perform Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Electronic Warfare (EW) mission area requirements. Autonomy technologies being matured include a robust perception approach using Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors and technologies that enable autonomous all-weather operations, detection of low radar cross section craft, reduced vulnerability to jamming, and operations with reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions. MCM technologies being developed include mine sweeping capabilities using High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) magnets in combination with acoustic sweep technologies. ASW technologies being developed include an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) to be assessed for its autonomous ASW track and trail capability. The project also includes development of an NTSS EW payload integrated with an MS3 Sonar. These emerging technologies are being designed and developed for an MDUSV prototype that will be capable of performing multiple autonomous missions over extended periods of time.\n\nTern Complete Tern, a joint ONR and DARPA project, previously funded in 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.\nContinue airplane launch and recovery component and subsystem technology developments to enable medium size, long endurance, long-range Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to be launched and recovered on short deck ships.

The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve experiments and tests that demonstrate proof of concept for the technological capability being developed. Technology development is informed by periodic interaction with Naval warfighters, resource sponsors and the acquisition community. At the lowest level, each project is evaluated against technical and financial milestones on a frequent basis. Annually, each project is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research. Department of the Navy leadership is briefed on the portfolio's status by the Chief of Naval Research."

The EMRG capability will support Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC\/FIAC) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions.  Design, fabricate and integrate Electro Magnetic (EM) railgun subsystems and components into a system prototype capable of rep-rate operations.  Assess the manufacturability of major components such as the railgun launcher and pulsed power modules, which are key to the technology capability. Conduct preliminary prototype system tests and demonstrations to prove the technological feasibility of the EMRG capability and assess sub-system and componentoperability under stressing rep-rate conditions.  Continue developing and testing a prototype rep-rate railgun launcher that is suitable for installation in a prototype railgun gun mount, where the design of the power and energy architecture necessary to support the prototype EMRG system can be assessed. Continue to test and build full-scale electro-magnetic railgun system prototypes that include the battery charging system, the pulsed power subsystem, and the electromagnetic launcher. Perform full-scale testing of long-life railgun launcher material solutions inserted in laboratory launchers. Design, build, test, and evaluate iterative electromagnetic railgun composite launcher prototypes to demonstrate the technological feasibility, performance, multi-shot life, and suitable firing rate of the system.  Continue activities to integrate and test a Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) for use with the EMRG.\n\n- Continued SSL TM.  Continue development of a maritime laser weapons system prototype and test it on a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant. Conduct the required laser weapon system engineering, design, integration and testing necessary to have a testable, experimental prototype. This system will be capable of supporting missions such as defense against small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and defeat.  The results of scientific and engineering trade studies, including those that measure atmospheric absorption and turbulence, will be used to support the integration and testing of a maritime beam director and a high power, Solid State Laser (SSL) capable of tracking and engaging surface and airborne targets at a relevant stand-off distance in the maritime environment.  A Hybrid Predictive Avoidance Safety System (HPASS) will be integrated with a solid state laser weapon system demonstrator to de-conflict laser operations with friendly sensors and platforms. At-sea testing will be conducted on the full laser weapon system demonstrator (i.e., prototype) from a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant."

These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nActivities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Research efforts are carefully selected to ensure they have the potential to expand warfighting capabilities, inform operational concepts and requirements development, and advance state of the art technology and scientific knowledge.  Current guidance also highlights the need to accelerate our pace of development and guide the approach to rapid experimentation, prototyping, and learning.\n\nAs reflected in the Marine Corps Operating Concept, the current strategic guidance from the Commandant, expeditionary forces will conduct maneuver warfare in environments characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information used as a weapon, a battle of signatures, and an increasingly contested maritime domain. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. \n\nThese future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting size, weight, power, cost (SWAP-C) limitations, and information availability within distributed, intermittent and limited (DIL) environments. \n\nThe approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both \"push\" and \"pull\" aspects of technology projects.  This PE matures technologies emerging from PE 0602131M to develop concept prototypes and initial experimentation to confirm feasibility in an environment relavent to operations. Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These demonstrations and experiments focus on the specific technologies, not necessarily their operational application, and vary based on the technical maturity of the project. This early technology exposure gives Marines a view into the future and enables them use their imagination and innovation to envision novel employment of the technology and inform the acquisition process."

Research supports both networked and local computation for communications that exploits the expeditionary forces close physical proximity to threats while mitigating shortfalls commiserate within distributed, intermittent, and limited (DIL) environments. Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyberattacks.\n\nTechnologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to SWAP-C constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.\n\nFurther, this activity integrates and demonstrates enhanced communications and situational awareness capabilities in experimental and warfighting environments reflecting USMC operations. Advanced technology resources will be developed and applied to complement commercial, other service, and defense agency investments to produce a technology base addressing identified Marine Corps technology gaps.  Focus will be on developing component level prototypes and experimentation in relevant environments."

The activity invests in vehicle survivability aspects that are exacerbated due to SWAP-C constraints inherent to Marine Corps operation and the harsh nature of the amphibious environment. \n\nTechnologies addressed include lightweight armor for ballistic and underbody blast protection, advanced sensors for counter tactical surveillance, active protection, and signature management. This activity also considers technology for payloads, packages and sensors that are needed by amphibious vehicles (both manned and unmanned) including mine counter measures; explosive hazard defeat systems; and obstacle and threat detection systems as well as technologies for improved protection for individuals against blast, ballistic and blunt impact threats."

The objective of the work in this PE is to develop promising technologies emerging from the FNC technology candidates funded in PE 0602131M that have been matured to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0603673N.  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects, where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in this PE.  Funding for FNC technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in PE 0602131M.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces. \n\nPrior to FY19, FNC Program investments were selected almost two years in advance of execution.  It was determined by Navy and Marine Corps leadership that this approach limits DON's ability to exploit technology advances and respond quickly to naval needs.  As a result, future BA 3 investments supporting the FNC Program are now made less than one year before commencing execution. Because FNCs are now starting at higher TRLs, the typical duration of an FNC has been shortened to 3-years.  The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Individual R-2 Activities have been discontinued and investments are organized to enhance collaboration with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors. A complete accounting of the technologies being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort referenced as continuing in the FY18 plans of this PE will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

This includes efficient and responsive force sustainment, planning and directing logistics operations, logistics demand reduction, fleet maintenance, and expeditionary energy.  Expeditionary Energy enhances combat capability of expeditionary warfighters by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of energy production, storage, distribution and use. Beyond traditional energy efforts, this portfolio also looks at other issues, including energy-efficient behaviors and hybridization of energy sources.

Work will emphasize experimentation with autonomy approaches through both simulation and live events for amphibious vehicles from small low cost craft, traditional amphibious combat and assault vehicles, and landing craft. Additional focus will be on integrating real time precepts with learned information, a priori knowledge, and contextual understanding to facilitate informed autonomous decision making.  There will be demonstration and experimentation with systems that enable intelligent planning, reasoning, learning, and control to affect tactically appropriate autonomous behaviors in littoral and urban environments.  In addition efforts will be pursued in component technology and prototypes for future advanced manned expeditionary ground vehicles and amphibians."

                                        "val": "As a subordinate organization under the Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&I), the mission of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory \/ Futures Directorate (MCWL\/FD) is to identify future challenges and opportunities, develop warfighting concepts, and comprehensively explore options in order to inform the combat development process to meet the challenges of the future operating environment.  DC, CD&I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for Science and Technology (S&T).  MCWL's Commanding General (CG) is the DC, CD&I designated Proponent of USMC S&T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&T.  The MCWL\/FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.  \n\nThe current MCWL\/FD Campaign Plan addresses how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) called for in the Secretary of the Navy's \"Cooperative Strategy 21\" and the Marine Corps' capstone \"Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21)\" concept, according to the objectives of the Commandant of the Marine Corps' guidance to develop the future Marine Corps Force 2025.  Execution of the MCWL\/FD Campaign Plan results in recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  In support of the Marine Corps' role to provide an ever-ready quick strike force to protect US interests, MCWL\/FD pursues concepts and new capabilities focused on the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The MAGTF is the Marine Corps' doctrinal, task organized, force deployment package.  It consists of four elements:  the Command Element that provides overarching command and control (C2) of the entire force; the Ground Combat Element normally built around a core infantry unit with supporting armor, artillery, and other ground units; the Aviation Combat Element which provides aircraft, air defense, and other aviation functions; and the Logistics Combat Element which consists of combat service support (CSS) elements including medical, supply, and transportation.  Marine Corps Force 2025 also seeks to maximize the employment of electronic, information, and cyber warfare, as well as manned\/unmanned teaming, within each element of the MAGTF.  MCWL\/FD also examines future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment.  MCWL\/FD accomplishes its mission through five subordinate Divisions:  \n\nFutures Assessment Division's (FAD's) mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks. \n\nThe mission of Concepts and Plans (CAP) Division is to:  examine select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges, and Naval warfare and joint\/coalition integration and capabilities, in order to develop Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS to promote development of the emergent Marine Corps force.  CAP is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.\n\nWargaming Division conducts formal wargames to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and identify opportunities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities. \n\nExperiment Division conducts live force concept-based experimentation to facilitate exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  \n\nScience and Technology (S&T) Division conducts investigations and assessments to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL\/FD investigates the relevance to EF21 capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following EF21 derived Thrust Areas:  Command, Control, Communications, and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Autonomy and Robotics; MAGTF Fires; Maneuver; Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy); Expeditionary Medicine; Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW); and Force Protection. \n\nMCWL\/FD investments encompass inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  CSS and Force Protection; MAGTF C4; MAGTF ISR; Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence."

This is accomplished by means of enhancing current functional capabilities by investigations into Next Generation Wargaming tools as well as conducting extensive wargaming as an augmentation to live force experimentation. Efforts include 11 planned wargames (4 large, 5 medium, and 2 small) with areas of interest covering EF21 related concepts.  Focusing 15 to 30 years in the future, continue to offer top level identification and analysis of emerging asymmetric threats and opportunities.  This is accomplished by capitalizing on a myriad of foresight assessments of future operating environments.  Continue to develop, assess, and provide insight into joint efforts and warfighting concepts. Specific areas of investment include: 1) Demonstrating the military utility of a resilient, low-cost, effective, high-altitude balloon-borne communications platform that can be rapidly deployed to enhance warfighter communication capabilities and 2) Informing the development of distributed mobile amphibious (and ground) assault fuel logistics capabilities as well as demonstrating the feasibility of executing the concept in support of a \"fight tonight\" scenario using current fleet assets, by adapting current naval practices. Initiate investigations into candidate technologies that support urban operations, in an effort to identify\/eliminate capability gaps and develop TTPs to include subterranean maneuver. This is an attempt to: 1) Develop a 5th generation force capable of ship to shore movement against a peer adversary, enabling distributed maneuver at varied distances and 2) Develop a 6th generation force capable of dominating the urban environment. The concepts: 1) Explore innovative delivery systems to augment current ability to maneuver troops, effects, and materiel from ship to shore in contested environments and 2) Involve integration by engineers and scientists with planners and operators to identify key capability concept  areas for development."

The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.\n  \nThis program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next-generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and\/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The objective of the work in this PE is to develop promising technologies emerging from the FNC Applied Research program funded in PE 0602750N Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research that have been matured to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects, where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4\/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in this PE.  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in PE 0602750N Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research .  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces."

It was determined by Navy and Marine Corps leadership that this approach limits DON's ability to exploit technology advances and respond quickly to naval needs.  As a result, future BA 3 investments supporting the FNC Program are now made less than one year before commencing execution. Because FNCs are now starting at higher TRLs, the typical duration of an FNC has been shortened to 3-years.  The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration. R-2 Activities were modified for FY19 to align to warfare areas and the corresponding resource sponsors that will integrate FNC technologies into acquisition programs of record.  A complete accounting of the technologies being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort referenced as continuing in the FY18 plans of this PE will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

In general, investments transition emerging Science and Technology (S&T) results to acquisition programs; improve industrial capabilities in production, maintenance, repair and industrial base responsiveness; and advance manufacturing technology to reduce cost, improve performance, and responsiveness. Currently, the ManTech Program is focused on affordability improvements for specific key acquisition platforms as defined in the Navy ManTech Investment Strategy. Key platforms currently targeted include: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)\/OHIO Replacement Program (ORP); DDG 51 Class Destroyer; CVN 78 Class Carrier; Joint Strike Fighter (JSF); and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter. ONR ManTech helps these Navy programs achieve their respective affordability goals by transitioning developed manufacturing technology which, when implemented, results in needed cost reduction or cost avoidance.\n\nThis Program Element, new as of FY16, is the result of the re-alignment of funds from PE 0708011N Industrial Preparedness and the Manufacturing Science and Technology activity from PE 0603758N Navy Warfighting Experiments and Demonstrations."

It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The National Institutes for Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nAll Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Specific improvements are classified.\n- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4\/day.\n- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and\/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.\n- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%. Array handling will be compatible with the existing TB-29 handling system.\n\nIncrease sensor to shooter performance and the effective lifetime of distributed ASW search systems by:\n- Achieving a drifting active distributed system lifetime of at least two days in areas of tactical significance while maintaining required system performance with a minimum number of sensor nodes.\n- Maintaining an effective lifetime of a month for mobile active distributed systems when subjected to the action of eddies from a major ocean current.\n- Predicting reseed 6 hours before performance degrades.\n- Holding the Area of Uncertainty (AOU) to no larger than 10 nm2 for an hour after initial detection through the control of the coherent sources.\n\nThrough a combination of better Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) command-level training and improved operator training provide the following:\n- Improve the ability of active sonar operators to detect targets and reject potential false alarms compared to current simulation based training.\n- Increase Pd by 50%.\n- Provide a decrease in FAR by a factor of two.\n- Provide a reduction in the probability of a hit on a High Value Unit (HVU) by a factor of two.\n- Improve the ability of the ASW Commander to position assets to increase coverage, reduce active system interference and deal effectively with competing missions.\n- Reduce training cost by greater than 80% and increase the frequency of training opportunities by greater than 600% relative to live training."

All SwampWorks activities are targeted towards advancing the capabilities of naval warfighters. Because of the portfolio's high-risk nature, brief exploratory studies can be performed to examine the maturation of the technology proposed before making substantial investments. The SwampWorks program has substantial flexibility in planning and execution which includes a streamlined approval process to allow for the shortest possible technology development timeframe. The balance of the S&T projects that will start in FY18 will be identified during FY18 as the needs of the warfighters, for investments in this portfolio, evolve or change. SwampWorks is not limited to any set of technology areas. The portfolio is open to great ideas all year long and invests in innovative technology development that will ultimately provide a dramatic improvement for the warfighter."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance, input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). The strategy is also based on the unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century.  The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect\/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces. Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat. Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations. Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective. Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect\/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs. This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports advanced development for battlespace shaping weapons including advanced undersea weapons.  It supports the MCM related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs). Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nThe increase in FY 2017 is due to the transfer of research efforts and activities previously conducted in the Advanced Sea Mines Future Naval Capability (FNC) effort (SHD-FY16-OSD Modular Undersea Effectors (MUSE)) from PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development to PE 0603782N Mine and Expeditionary Warfare Advanced Technology."

These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities.\n\nThe projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future. The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be modified or established to support further development. These investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.\n\nDeveloping INPs requires the development of subsystems and components, and efforts to integrate these subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and tests in an appropriate environment. The efforts funded within this PE include concept and technology demonstrations of components and subsystems, which may be form, fit and function prototypes or scaled models that serve the same demonstration purpose. The goal of these development efforts is to prove the technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use. By demonstrating the general military utility and direct relevance to identified military needs, the technology becomes available for transition and further development within an emerging or new Program of Record. INPs investments do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but they do have the goal of moving out of Science and Technology (S&T) and into the acquisition process within the future years defense program (FYDP).\n\nThis PE was new for FY 2018 and consolidated all Navy 6.3 investments funding INP investments into a single Navy 6.3 PE. In FY 2017, these investments were spread across 5 separate 6.3 PEs: 0603114N Power Projection Advanced Technology, 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology, 0603271N Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology, 0603747N Undersea Warfare Advanced Technology, and 0603758N Navy Warfighting Experiments and Demonstrations. Accordingly, the projects in the portfolio are no longer distinguished as INPs or Leap Ahead-Technologies.   Rather, they are now referred to simply as INPs. \n\nDue to the nature of these projects, starting in FY19, plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees."

This project develops a prototype and will demonstrate cyber sensors and automated vulnerability assessment cyber tools that deliver comprehensive defense-in-depth cyber capabilities to monitor, detect, mitigate, and recover from cyber threats in near real-time. Relevant naval cyber tools will be developed and tested to verify the technology can autonomously perform cyber vulnerability assessments and implement mitigation strategies that protect naval platforms from unauthorized cyber intrusions. New cyber autonomy tools will be developed to protect critical naval warfighting capabilities supporting multiple missions, including time critical strike, expeditionary warfare, anti-surface warfare, and anti-air warfare. These tools, which rely on cyber components, will be developed and demonstrated over an extended period of time at several integrated hardware in-the-loop facilities across the Naval Research Enterprise. Optimized cyber resiliency warfighting effectiveness will be developed and demonstrated. The technology will be developed to protect common layers of cyber functionality in hardware components, and local, system, and peripheral buses. The protection will be extended into the system BIOS, hypervisor, operating system, middleware, the application space, and the network infrastructure."

Continue to document the data analysis from the technology development in order to transition the information to Program Executive Office for the Littoral Combat Ship.\n\nLow-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)\nInitiate the BA 3 technology development effort for the LOCUST project, which will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of military operations and areas of operations. LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses. This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution. During FY18, the LOCUST program will begin to develop a range of key technologies that will be integrated together in order to demonstrate a scalable system of inexpensive, commoditized, swarming UAVs that provide disruptive capabilities. Critical milestones for each major sub-system and system will be established, as well as a revisit to requirements and metrics throughout. Yearly wargames will be utilized to shape and inform the demonstrations, which will be of increasing complexity in both mission and operating environment. The demonstrations in turn will provide the Navy with an ability to spiral out capability as needed. FY18 demonstrations are planned to encompass missions utilizing\nintelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and kinetic strike payloads.\n\nMedium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV)\nContinue the MDUSV project, which was previously funded predominantly in 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology\nDevelopment. The MDUSV project will design and build a prototype MDUSV platform sized for theater or global\nindependent operations. New autonomy, Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies will be integrated into the MDUSV platform. The capability of the MDUSV to autonomously perform ASW, MCM and EW missions over an extended period of time will be demonstrated during a 40-day period of at-sea testing. The capability to autonomously operate in all-weather conditions, using new technologies that provide robust perception using Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors that detect low radar cross-section craft with reduced vulnerability to jamming and reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions, will be assessed. The use of integrated acoustic and High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) mine influence sweep technologies as well as a novel ASW sensor suite that includes an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) will be tested on an instrumented range.\n\nTern\nComplete Tern, a joint ONR and DARPA effort, previously funded in 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development. Continue TERN technology development by conducting hardware and software testing and a sea-based Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) flight demonstration. The developed Tern enabling technologies have been focused on supporting a DDG-51 and LCS-2 based future long endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) capability that could be transitioned and implemented with minimal ship modification."

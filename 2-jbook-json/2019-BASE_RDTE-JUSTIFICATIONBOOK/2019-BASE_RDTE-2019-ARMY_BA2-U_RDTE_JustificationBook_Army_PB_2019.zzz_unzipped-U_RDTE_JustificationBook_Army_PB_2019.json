Research conducted enables new manufacturing capabilities through the development of high performance feedstock materials (polymers, metals, ceramics), physics-based process models, and in situ process monitoring that can be integrated with process models to enable real-time control and manipulation of materials structure and properties.  The goal of this work is to develop robust predictive model and simulation tools linking manufacturing processes with materials structure, properties, and performance to accelerate the rate of innovative material adaptations (protection, power, sensing, signature management) necessary to rapidly respond to emerging and unknown threats in a battlefield environment.\n\nThis Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, and Soldier portfolios.  \n\nWork in this Project makes extensive use of high performance computing and experimental validation and builds on research transitioned from Program Element (PE) 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences), Project H42 (Materials and Mechanics), and Project H43 (Ballistics).  The work complements and is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Survivability and Lethality Technologies), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology), and PE 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battle space focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness.\n\nThis Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in Program Element (PE) 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology). The networked sensing and data fusion efforts performed in this Project complement efforts funded in PE 0601104A \/ Project H50 (Network Sciences CTA) and PE 0601104A \/ Project J15 (Network Science and Technology Research Center International Technology Alliance).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas."

This research utilizes a combination of technologies based on the nature of the different threats, as well as the fundamental differences in sensors operating over different frequency ranges. Passive organic and inorganic optical limiter materials that block specific frequency bands of light will be investigated and developed for the visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and active man-made material-based solutions will be investigated for uncooled sensors in the long-wave IR (LWIR). Vulnerability of sensors and optical sensor systems will be studied against high-power and ultrashort pulsed laser threats to determine protection requirements."

This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)\/electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) guided missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. It focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. Project CYB designs, creates, evaluates, and applies emerging cyber techniques and cyber situational awareness technologies to enhance Army capabilities and to mitigate risks and investigates cyber collection and mapping technologies to offer real time cyber situational awareness to enable interpretation of current threats and predict future enemy activities. .\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and is coordinated with PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nWork is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This Project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)\/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with, and as appropriate leveraged by, DEW and power\/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.\n\nThis Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, Soldier and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Portfolios.\n\nThe work in this Project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC\/ARSTRAT).  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and unattended sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution. Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of five key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, wireless power transfer, and advanced battery chemistries.  Additionally, materials and devices used for photonic applications, such as laser diodes and fiber lasers, will be studied and improved with an emphasis on overall size, weight, and power consumption efficiency gains."

Technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), lasers, and electronics. It also includes modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness of these technologies. Research focuses on infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in all operational environments. This Project designs, fabricates, and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational understanding, persistent surveillance, and hostile fire detection. This Project investigates and designs novel sensor electronics such as Digital Read Out Integrated Circuits (DROICs) to enable multifunction sensing. This Project also investigates and matures new semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from the periodic table. In addition, this Project develops algorithms for enhanced IR functionality, which provides the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets. The reduction of size, weight and power - Cost (SWaP-C) is a key research objective for all efforts.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The resulting data are the basis for weapon systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training as well as manpower requirements to improve equipment operation and maintenance. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, fewer errors, enhanced Soldier protection, user acceptance, and allows the Soldier to extract the maximum performance from the equipment.  \n\nMajor efforts research sources of stress, potential stress moderators, and intervention methods, and identify and quantify human performance measures and methods to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit adaptive learning methods and strategies, enhance and validate human performance modeling tools; investigate integration of advanced concepts in crew stations designs, optimizes interfaces for information systems and improves human robot interaction (HRI) in a full mission context.\n\nEfforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nResults of these efforts are transitioned to the Research, Development, and Engineering Centers, the Program Executive Offices (PEO) & Program Managers, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the Army's Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering command (RDECOM)."

This Project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The Project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Environment and Terrain Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nTechnologies developed in this Project are fully coordinated and complementary to Program Element (PE) 0603728A, Project 025."

Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and develops software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and develops materiel solutions, including rapidly emplaced bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with protective construction and critical infrastructure. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to assess non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.  \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. The Ground Portfolio technology investments are enabling Power Projection. \n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology).  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM)."

Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. This Project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather\/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nThis work transitions technologies to the Department of Defense weather and operations modeling community, the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing to improve their operational weather support to the Army Project Leader-Fire Support Command and Control and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for field artillery systems, the Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A), the Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Agency, the Program Executive Office Aviation\/Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS)."

Focus areas include force projection and maneuver, including austere port and airfield entry; prediction, definition, avoidance, or defeat of natural and manmade gaps and obstacles to support ground force operations; scalable weapons effects; and high-resolution representation of near-surface terrain and environment for use with sensor models for target detection and unmanned ground systems (UGS) navigation. This research also provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation. Work in this Project increases the protection of soldiers and critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging threats and enables maneuver support of ground forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This Project supports efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for operations in a number of environments including dismounted Soldiers conducting missions in urban and subterranean environments, distributed small units, and projection and sustainment of forces across an increasing large battlefield.      \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I), Environment and Terrain, and Soldier Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities for Air Missile Defense and Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to Program Element (PE) 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology).

The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, and homeland security. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the capability of autonomous engineering during combat operations to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk\/threat and dynamic environments, enables installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and on-demand expeditionary structures, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in contingency operations, including urban environments.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priority for Next Generation Combat Vehicle."

Numerical modeling of weather effects on terrain properties supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command-delivered solutions to the Soldier. The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priority for Network\/C3I."

This PE develops new personnel measures and methods that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE develops new performance measures and metrics for individuals and units, designs innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.   \n\nEfforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.

These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This Project develops new performance measures and metrics for individuals and units, designs innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Research in this Project will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.   \n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology (S&T) Soldier portfolio. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy."

Included are investigations of technologies, novel materials, and test methods related to personnel armor, helmets, hearing protection, eyewear, uniforms, handwear, footwear, and other clothing and individual equipment items. This Project also supports the investigation and development of novel combat identification technologies, electro-textiles for power generation and distribution, the study and exploration of algorithms for autonomous micro and nano robotics and sensors, and human-machine teaming technologies to enhance the dismounted Soldier's Situational Awareness (SA) and Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) with autonomous systems. In addition, this Project supports the development and refinement of essential analytic tools needed to predict and\/or assess the combat effectiveness of next generation Soldier systems to identify and develop methods to assess human responses to sensory, physical, cognitive, and affective stimuli and stressors.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project is coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602787A (Medical Technology Initiatives), and PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology).\n  \nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

                        "val": "This Program Element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices\/ procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Military Relevant Infectious Diseases, Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine, Medical Simulation and Information Sciences, and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences.\n\nResearch is funded in six projects.\n\nProject 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighters from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e., the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency. \n\nProject 870 designs and refines drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic assays\/tests devices, other preventive measures for protection and treatment against naturally occurring infectious diseases as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.\n\nProject 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, and life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and clinical practice guidelines to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related traumatic injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction. Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissue for the care and treatment of wounded Service Members. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency. \n\nProject ET4 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics, medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post-evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of wounded Service Members. This project is coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.\n\nProject VB4 includes applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate biological tests and computer simulations in clinical trials and in animal studies. The PTSD and coagulopathy exemplars have demonstrated the power of an iterative systems biology approach and are moving projects related to objective diagnostics and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies. Development of the SysBioCube (a data analysis, management and integration system) has provided the ability for complex collaborative efforts to share, process, and evaluate data using innovative technologies. These concerted refinement efforts using systems biology are showing reduction of time and funding for solutions to intractable problems of critical military importance. \n\nProject XV5 conducts applied research on health information technologies that support combat casualty care under conditions of dispersed small-unit operations or requiring prolonged field care before evacuation. Technologies include autonomous casualty care systems and virtual health communications for Roles of Care one (combat medic and battalion aid station) through three (field hospital).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.\n\nWork funded in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A (Medical Advanced Technology) and the Defense Health Program."

Will continue work to evaluate risk and resilience markers for Warfighters including those deploying to non-combat operations. Will document linkages between sleep problems and mission-related mistakes as well as suicide-related thoughts. Will continue to determine the risk and resilience markers for family functioning, specifically, the impact of military community transformation (downsizing and increasing) and deployment on family member health and marital functioning. Will continue to provide resilience training best practices by validating a measure of resilience training utilization and sleep awareness training. Will continue work to deliver a revised Unit Behavioral Health Needs Assessment tool. Will continue to conduct studies to verify whether a computer-based tool can help Warfighters deal with occupational stress and have more positive post-deployment outcomes, to include a reduction in anger symptoms and optimize cognitive flexibility. Will deliver recommendations for implementation of unit-based social fitness training. Will develop measures of leadership behaviors for improving behavioral health, anger and risk-taking in units. Will deliver recommendations for increasing positive attitudes toward behavioral health care. Will provide recommendations for a provider toolkit to assist in return-to-duty decisions. Will continue studies to increase treatment engagement and adherence and determine best model for increasing provider use of evidence-based practices."

Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1) Prevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases\n(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n \nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nWork is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, Project 810.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this Project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories."

The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is the integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, using global multi-omic methods to identify and discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions (physiologic, immunologic, endocrine, etc.), supporting transition of research to clinical applications. This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement as seen in biomarker development for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and enhanced analyses of coagulopathy. Another application of systems biology is to characterize physiological pathways altered by toxic substances enabling identification of the causative toxic substances as well as to understand the injury mechanisms. The detection\/identification of physiological markers of exposure to toxic substances can then be used to support medical countermeasure decisions or development of targeted therapeutic drugs.\n\nThese examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to Projects studying biological systems (PTSD) Project have been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD \/ United States Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR)."

Will conduct data analyses of findings with chronic pain, suicidality, infection and effects of microgravity (functions as a stressor) to integrate with clinical results. Will evaluate nutritional supplements in the mouse model simulating features of PTSD in order to assess improved resolution or recovery. Will integrate clinical and multi-molecular studies of PTSD in humans to confirm a candidate panel(s) to diagnose chronic PTSD for advancement to a LDT which will be confirmed by a commercial lab; will identify three to four DoD clinical sites which will have the facilities to evaluate the LDT as a precursor for moving forward with an FDA product.

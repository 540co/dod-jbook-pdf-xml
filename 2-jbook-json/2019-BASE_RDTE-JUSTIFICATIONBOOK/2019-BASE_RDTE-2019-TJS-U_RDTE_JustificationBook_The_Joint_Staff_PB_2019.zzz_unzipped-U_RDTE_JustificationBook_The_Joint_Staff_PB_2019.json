As part of the Joint Staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to IAMD issues.  JIAMDO is the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads mission area and utility analyses for air and missile defense, integrates air and missile defense within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in development of the IAMD Prioritized Capability List, the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment, and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues."

The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's statutory responsibility to provide \u201cbest military advice\u201d to the SECDEF and POTUS by expressing his vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20 year horizon; identifying joint force development implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The overarching goal is to enable investment decisions between near and far term. Concepts drive horizontal integration for force development across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. An intent of the Joint Concepts program is to support senior leader decisions in balancing today\u2019s requirements and future force requirements. Key deliverables include:  \n\nCapstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) that provides the Chairman's vision for the future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations. \n\nFamily of Joint Concepts, based on National Military Strategy (NMS), provides operational approaches to future challenges or opportunities with respect to Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations in order to guide current and future Joint Force development. \n\nJoint Concept Transition Plans, developed for each joint concept, document approaches for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) changes in the future Joint Force and identifies conceptual ideas that may require further exploration.  \n\nJoint Operating Environment (JOE) describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force so it can anticipate and prepare for potential conflicts. The JOE articulates the circumstances that are likely to alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. Finally, the JOE provides a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time.\n\nThe International Force Development Division\u2019s (IFDD) mission is to ensure collaboration and integration throughout the spectrum of joint force development, so that both the Joint Staff and its Allies and partners invest in any required reforms to ensure continued, interoperable and seamless operations together to meet the objectives in the NMS. The Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC) is an initiative led by the United States Joint Staff which partners with 22 countries and international organizations designed to develop and assess non-materiel force development solutions and close capability gaps in multinational operations. Funds are used solely for travel in support of U.S. led projects and events with multinational and coalition partners."

Also, the revised CCJO will identify force development implications and required capabilities to maintain U.S. competitive advantage against emerging threats out to 2035. In partnership with selected Combatant Commands and the Services, development of the Joint Operating Concepts to address strategic challenges has begun.  The Joint Operating Concept (JOC) \u2013 China and JOC - Russia prospectuses have been approved. The Director Joint Staff has endorsed the framework and authorized the continued development of two JOCs.  The initial research on JOC \u2013 North Korea has begun and the prospectus is expected to be approved in early FY 2018.  The concept prospectus describes the compelling military challenge and how it will be addressed in the future. JOC \u2013 Iran is in the very early stages of prospectus development. Study of the 2035 operating environment continues and informs understanding of military challenges associated with the common view of the future operating environment.  Work with Five Eyes (FVEY) countries is focused on developing a FVEY common view of the future operating environment.  Development support was completed for the Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning and the Joint Concept for Operating in the Information Environment.  Concept implementation is underway for the Joint Concepts for rapid aggregation, robotic and autonomous systems, human aspects of military operations, access and maneuver in the global commons, preventing the transfer and use of weapons of mass Destruction, and operational contract support."

The Joint Staff Operations Directorate is responsible for GFM allocation and is the functional manager of the GFM mission applications. Accordingly, the Joint Staff will employ a strategy for efficiently fulfilling Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nThe DoD must quickly transition from legacy force management systems that promulgate data disparity across the Defense enterprise in order to meet national military objectives that have evolved from large force scenarios to operations that include small-to-full scale activities. As stated in both the NSS and NMS, our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic means. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that keeps pace with globally changing threats to rapidly and accurately accomplish force sourcing activities to support SecDef allocation decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service\u2019s Organizatonal Server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces.

These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n\n- Air Force JNTC\n\n- Navy JNTC\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training that improves interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and creating a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System, consisting of the Joint Theater Level Simulation and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation, provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO, and multinational partners. The joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners by continuing limited investments ensuring Joint Theater Level Simulation and Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation remain relevant providing reliable, low-cost, small footprint, distributed, and deployable joint training solutions. \n \nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based joint operations core curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training (externally funded); and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 program goals and objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment. Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard."

The Joint Training Environment (JTE) is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes with accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating programmatic actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience. These capabilities enhance the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  RDT&E funding supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  The resulting capabilities enable selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command headquarter levels.  The funding increases warfighter access to semi-automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment through web-based, modular cloud capabilities. \n\nThe Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the joint force to be responsive to the warfighters\u2019 changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed joint live, virtual, and constructive enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and high interest training issues identified in the Chairman\u2019s annual training guidance."

These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n\n- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Interoperability Division (JID)\n\n- Marine Corps Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support Services and USSOCOM requirements to provide trained and ready forces in support Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training; and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment.  Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.\n\nJID: Joint Interoperability Division (JID) supports 35 annual schoolhouse interoperability courses and up to six CAPSTONE Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) courses tied to various Combatant Command (CCMD) joint exercises. JID trains CCMD, Services and partner nations' operations center personnel on interoperability planning tasks required during contingencies and exercises in emerging mission areas such as joint fires, net enabled weapons, remotely piloted aircraft, integrated air and missile defense, and contested operations including secure internet with Link-16\/TDL equipped major weapon systems and smart bombs.\n\nMarine Corps JNTC:  These funds provide USMC stability and risk reduction to a variety of ongoing joint efforts focused on improving the fidelity and realism of training simulation systems that prepare Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for deployment in support of CCMD operations and is additionally available to other organizations via the JLVC federation of training tools.  In support of the Commandant\u2019s planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance and support of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF) Bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  It also provides a single source training environment capability enabling users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, it also enhances pattern of life and indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers' ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into training scenarios. \n\nADL: The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver training and education more efficiently and cost effectively. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. This oversight supports interagency interoperability and promotes personnel readiness, ensuring the right people receive the right training at the right time."

JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~550,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by providing global 24\/7 access to mandatory joint training as they prepare to participate in CCMD exercises and real world missions. JKO will also focus on enhancements to improve the management of individual training records and readiness reporting as the JKO LCMS extends information sharing and web services with DoD personnel management systems.  JKO will continue to maintain compliance with current security directives and to enhance functionality based on user experience and feedback.\n\n2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO LCMS.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for Combatant Command exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations. The SGST will be used as part of the OSD-endorsed blended learning training packages in approximately eight Combatant Command training exercises and additional training events preparing individuals serving on Combatant Command boards, centers, cells and working groups supporting small functional teams and C\/JTF \"battle staffs.\"  Individual training proficiency improvement will be measured and quantified as part of the exercise design.  JKO will continue to maintain compliance with current security directives and to enhance SGST functionality based on user experience and feedback.\n\n3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing a comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile application and mobile training products. JKO\u2019s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO mobile application. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, Podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered onsite and on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide. JKO will continue to maintain compliance with dynamic cybersecurity requirements as well as staying current with dynamic industry standard operating systems to enhance its mobile capability based on user experience and feedback."

Based on the Commandant's planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-multi-resolution federation bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  The MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also provides a single source training environment capability that enables users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems easing the burden of requesting terrain, 3D models, and other geographic layers into a single source. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also enhances pattern of life (PoL) \/ indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers the ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into the training scenarios."

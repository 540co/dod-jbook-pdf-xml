This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\" January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\" January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record \u2013 which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.\n\nNuclear terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based prompt diagnostic systems and airborne sample collection systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of nuclear forensics. \n\nPer DoDD 2060.04 OSD AT&L NCB provides guidance and direction for the implementation of the Department of Defense National Technical Nuclear Forensics program.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but emphasizes post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post-detonation nuclear forensics capability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program."

The DoD test bed program validates and tests the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment. The test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to evaluate energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test bed's key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations."

The HD R&D Program accomplishes the GCC support by utilizing host nation demining partners to evaluate technology in actual minefields to simultaneously achieve HMA objectives and identify performance parameters; data is delivered to the US military countermine R&D programs to inform future investment decisions.  In addition to the improvements made to technologies used by U.S. forces and to the reduction of landmine and UXO threat to US forces and host nation population, the Program\u2019s technology trainings and evaluations build mine action capacity and capability within mine-affected countries and improve safety, stability and economic development. \n\nSince 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 202 evaluations in 39 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Zimbabwe.  The program\u2019s technologies have cleared 46.7 million square meters of the world\u2019s toughest minefields; and found or destroyed 186,000 mines and UXO.\n\nNew technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop and a biennial UXO Working Group Meeting held by OASD SO\/LIC.  The meetings involve representatives from Department of State (DOS), GCC Humanitarian Mine Action offices, mine action organizations and mine-affected nations.  The program element\u2019s work fulfills the Department of Defense\u2019s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with \u00a7 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance."

                        "val": "The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD is currently estimated at approximately $19 billion per year (down from approximately $22 billion in Fiscal Year 2007). The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 \"Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure\" of 01 February 2010.\n \nThe Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as collaboration between universities, Armed Forces Academies and DoD laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development and producing individuals with corrosion expertise for the DoD corrosion control community of the future.  Research areas include performance prediction, assessment of finish, surface engineering, and product support.  This advanced corrosion research has been ongoing since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.\n\nIn FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.\n\nThese projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense systems and infrastructure.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs and improve the availability and safety of weapon systems and facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  A total of 151 projects have been completed to date and 111 have resulted in new technology implementation.  The overall return on investment as estimated by the Military Departments is 16:1."

                                        "val": "The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD is currently estimated at approximately $19 billion per year (down from approximately $22 billion in Fiscal Year 2007). The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 \"Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure\" of 01 February 2010.\n \nThe Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as collaboration between universities, Armed Forces Academies and DoD laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development and producing individuals with corrosion expertise for the DoD corrosion control community of the future.  Research areas include performance prediction, assessment of finish, surface engineering, and product support.  This advanced corrosion research has been ongoing since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.\n\nIn FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.\n\nThese projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense systems and infrastructure.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs and improve the availability and safety of weapon systems and facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  A total of 151 projects have been completed to date and 111 have resulted in new technology implementation.  The overall return on investment as estimated by the Military Departments is 16:1."

CPO issues a call for proposed project plans in April and projects are submitted in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  CPO receives project plans and convenes an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, joint service applicability, and probability of transition.  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects, funding is distributed to the Military Departments by Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.  Project execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   \n\nResearch opportunities are funded through the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC).  A call for white paper proposals is issued by CPO through an existing U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Submissions are evaluated by a technical panel chaired by the Deputy Director, CPO.  Evaluation factors include quality of proposed research, potential impact on DoD corrosion problems, level of student involvement, and proposed collaboration between the research institutions and DoD laboratories.  Projects are ranked by the selection panel and funded based on merit and available funds.  Research institutions receive funds for the TCC through the establishment of cooperative agreements with USAFA.  Research execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   \n\nActivities are those work efforts associated with the Working Integrated Product Teams (WIPT) under the CPCIPT and include policy, training, specifications and standards, metrics, science and technology, facilities, and communication and outreach.  WIPT Leads submit funding requirements associated with their annual tactical plan submission to CPO.  The proposed activities are prioritized by CPO and funded based on merit and available funds.  Activities are accomplished by both government and contractor personnel.  Funds are transferred to government personnel through the MIPR process.  Funds are transferred to contractor personnel through competitively awarded contracts including the multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement held by CPO.  Progress on activities is reviewed tri-annually at meetings of the CPCIPT."

This effort develops and integrates new capability and architectures to optimize fielded weapon systems and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) to defeat these emerging threats. \n\nThe Missile Defeat Project coordinates and integrates Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) efforts to develop counter threat capability.  This effort measures the effectiveness of new architectures and revolutionary concepts against evolving threats by working with the IC, Combatant Commands, government labs, program offices, industry, and academia. \n\nTo meet this challenge the Missile Defeat Project leverages existing test and simulated environments to perform analysis of industry and government reference concepts and architectures to provide innovative technical solutions for missile defeat.  We are developing virtual and physical testbeds to robustly test, evaluate, and prototype architectures and assess their ability to improve time critical targeting and defeat of road-mobile threats.  The virtual testbed complements testing at physical ranges by providing an infrastructure for addressing different training, test, and evaluation needs.  This effort also includes systems engineering and analysis to devolve technical requirements, identify promising solutions, and inform future investment decisions.\n\nIn accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year FY 2017, the Department shall designate a military department or Defense Agency with acquisition authority with respect to missile defeat.  The Missile Defeat Project will transfer all activities and funding to other stakeholders starting in FY 2019.  The FY 2019 request enables this transfer without interrupting ongoing efforts.  \n\nFY 2018 AMENDED BUDGET REQUEST JUSTIFICATION: $26.400 million Base is required to address emergency warfighting readiness requirements.  Funds are required for various classified projects.  Additional classified details can be provided under a separate cover."

FY 2019 funds in the amount of $2.000 million are being transferred from PE 0603826D8Z for the continuation of Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) hardware and software assurance and integrity analysis activities planned across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).\n\nRecognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG.  Its goal is to eliminate the Department of Defense (DoD)\u2019s reliance on sole source foundries for trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics.  It supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD\u2019s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities implementing three integrated, complementary solutions that:  (1) protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of microelectronics components; (2) improve capabilities to evaluate and validate the trust and assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentive the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial SOTA microelectronics technology.\n\nThis activity is being led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.  This activity is conducted, in coordination with the JFAC Steering Committee and the Science and Technology (S&T) Advisory Board, by performers, such as the JFAC service providers, Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), and other DoD and Intelligence Community S&T organizations and laboratories in the area of hardware assurance (HwA) and software assurance (SwA).  It is integrating with, and supporting, the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related HwA and SwA S&T actions.  This activity is also expected to maintain and update the DoD long-term microelectronics strategy based on feedback from the execution of this PE and enable and leverage commercial and academic relationships as necessary to fulfill this mission."

Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories and other HwA and SwA capabilities are chartered as a JFAC to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and\/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technology nodes (<45 nanometers (nm)), throughput\/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities, in coordination with the JFAC, which prioritizes this investment as required to meet the realized and projected out-year demand for JFAC services.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:\n\u2022\tPhysical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards \n\u2022\tFunctional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening\/verification of select, critical parts\n\u2022\tDesign verification, i.e., verification\/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.\n\nThese improvements address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.\n\nThis project develops and matures assurance mitigations, evaluates the effectiveness of protections of IP in support of integrity, and develops and validates obfuscation and disaggregation technologies.  The project will address physical validation tool and capability development, design software validation tool development, counterfeit detection and imaging techniques, and system vulnerability assessments and testbeds.\n\nThis project also develops standards and practices in support of assured designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of USG access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., assured designs and supply chains.\n\nThis project enables JFAC to provide hardware and software assurance and integrity analysis tools, services, best-practices, contract language, and other help to programs that detect, assess, prioritize, and mitigate mission critical vulnerabilities to malicious hardware and software attacks and supply chain exploitation vulnerabilities.  Additionally, the JFAC will provide capabilities for programs to keep assessment findings throughout the life cycle of their systems for data mining (e.g., documentation on rationale for previous mitigation decisions regarding software, hardware, and firmware.)  The collaboration between the JFAC and program offices will help mitigate existing and emerging critical threats and vulnerabilities in both software and hardware and yield secure architecture and design patterns available to all DoD programs."

                                        "val": "This project funds a program of research to develop the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies while maintaining the required level of assurance in all environments.  DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom, secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base IP from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of SOTA microelectronics assurance.\n\nThis program of research will develop innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted and assured strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.  It also develops, demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.\n\nAssurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risk associated with sole-source suppliers and increase the Government\u2019s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of developed technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies developed under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of vetted third-party IP and EDA tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.\n\nThis project has received additional funding starting in FY 2019 to support microelectronics innovation efforts in the following focus areas:  capture and secure microelectronics R&D; new microelectronics development, demonstration, and capability insertion; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and opto-electronics."

DE weapons provide the warfighter with scalable, targeted, and precision engagement while minimizing collateral damage.  This focus area will prototype advanced technologies required to enable the broad employment of DE technologies across the joint force.  Example technologies include compact, efficient energy generation, energy storage, and thermal management technologies; high efficiency laser diodes; advanced manufacturing and fabrication techniques; and, robust beam control technologies.  Specific activities include effects testing to quantify target susceptibility to DE; development, testing, and optimization of DE subsystems; and, integration of weapon prototypes.  These prototyping activities will enable faster transition of DE technologies to the warfighter by reducing technical risk, informing joint force CONOPS, and demonstrating the capability DE provides to the warfighter.  A cross functional team, led by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, will review and select prototyping proposals from across the Department of Defense in the year of execution."

This effort matured and demonstrated a subset of technologies identified in the S2ME2 2017 Advanced Naval Technology Exercise, which were validated at the Bold Alligator and Dawn Blitz 2017 exercises.  Specifically, S2ME2 focused on seven technology thrusts with disruptive potential: 1) Long Range Littoral Reconnaissance: Unmanned capabilities to safely increase the reach and situational awareness of individual Marines; 2) Unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR-T): Maturation of an existing commercial vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for shipboard operations; 3) Unmanned Fire Support: Precision fire support with autonomous magazines deployed from off shore staging forces; 4) Coalition Tactical Awareness and Response (CTAR): Extension of commercial satellite services to the Regiment level; 5) Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution (4GLTE) Long Range Communications: Modified commercial technology to provide ship-to-ship high bandwidth communications; 6) Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-jam Steerable Parasitic Array: A novel, low size, weight, power, and cost GPS antenna array with the ability to null jammers; and 7) Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection\/Anti-Jam Communications: Replacement of omni-directional communications with tracked and targeted communication links.  For each thrust, S2ME2 investigated emerging and mature government and commercial technologies; developed requirements; integrated technologies on operational systems for relevant demonstrations; explored improved CONOPS; and, informed senior Navy and Marine Corps leadership on future procurement and training needs.  Following a series of live tests and field demonstrations, the S2ME2 project transitioned to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps."

The MRT project developed hardware hosted on the U.S. Pacific Command Joint Intel Operations Center (U.S. PACOM JIOC) and expanded a current intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) training system employed at Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory (LL).  With FY 2017 funds, the MRT system was technically assessed and demonstrated in FY 2018 with intel operators and instructors using real world scenarios, while also validating training scenarios specifically desired by the USPACOM JIOC TSTC.  The MTR reached initial operational capability at the U.S. PACOM JIOC TSTC and transitioned to U.S. PACOM JIOC.  MTR was developed to support U.S. PACOM\u2019s JIOC TSTC cell specific training needs, but the capability is extensible to the TST cells in other Combatant Commands.  After full operational capability is achieved in FY 2019, the Mission Rehearsal Trainer will transition to U.S. Pacific Command for operational use."

The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as operations\/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood, Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system will provide a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution. Long term GBSAA systems and Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) architectures, operating concepts, standards and technology are being developed to allow DoD, commercial and private manned and Group 1-5 Unmanned Aircraft to operate safely and effectively in the national Airspace.  \n \nThis joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems."

This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment & Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the Department's intent to reinvigorate wargaming.  CAPE accomplishes this by leading wargaming activities, developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near- to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants."

It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the vision of the Deputy Secretary of Defense to reinvigorate wargaming in the Department of Defense.  CAPE will accomplish this by leading wargaming activities; developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants."

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\u201d January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\u201d January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

This sub-project also oversees development of non-nuclear warhead technologies to defeat time-sensitive targets for near and longer-term CPGS applications.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components. This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program."

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program."

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

These efforts include conducting mission informed capability-based analysis; portfolio assessments to include analyzing modernization trends that result in the development of roadmaps or business area strategies that support balanced investment decisions; and monitoring and assessing Major Defense Acquisition Programs(MDAPs) , Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS), and defense Business Systems in a capability portfolio context.  Activities in the JTIDS project are divided into four areas:  (1) mission informed capability-based analysis; (2) Interoperability & Integration; (3) roadmap development and support to business area strategies; and (4) support tools and guidance.  JTIDS also enables cross-department collaboration to enable enterprise-wide approaches. This includes:  (1) vertical and horizontal integration activities within the Department and with the interagency where appropriate; (2) engaging in a coordinated portfolio-based approach to planning,  programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) reform efforts at the legislative, governance, management and execution levels.  JTIDS is focused on capabilities-based portfolio management of the Department's key enablers, thus there are many shared equities with in ASD(A) and across OSD.  To fully meet mission need the JTIDS program supports extensive collaboration with  required alliances and with other OSD PSA's for Communications and Networks, C2, Non-Intel Space  and Business Systems."

This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities. \n\nDefense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government\/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. \n\nA number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY18 will continue defining and implementing DEF \u2018best practices\u2019 related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace."

This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities. \n\nDefense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government\/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. \n\nA number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY18 will continue defining and implementing DEF \u2018best practices\u2019 related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace."

                        "val": "As the Department of Defense strategic, operational, and tactical plans and objectives transform the war fighter with new capabilities and doctrine, the budgeting and accountability of funds used to pursue the Department objectives will become more complicated and detailed for senior leaders to make decisions with supporting rationale for the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C).\n  \nNEXT GENERATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:\nThe Department\u2019s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD\u2019s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nToday, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.\n\nThere is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller\u2019s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.\n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.\n\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION TRACKING AND REPORTING TOOL:\n\nNo RDT&E funds are requested.  \n\nThe Defense Financial Management Certification Program (DFMCP) meets the business requirement to comply with section 1051 of the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Public Law 112-81, authorizing the Secretary of Defense to establish a certification program for the 54,000 Financial Management (FM) workforce in order to improve audit readiness and analytic capability.  \n\nThe Department of Defense has a requirement to strengthen the professional development of the DoD financial management workforce and to ensure that DoD financial managers are properly trained to meet current and future requirements to support the Warfighter.  The DFMCP is the approved strategy to meet this requirement.  The DFMCP needs a tracking and reporting tool for web-based course training and exams, a robust reporting capability for standard and ad hoc reports, a course search capability, sort filtering capability, and a capability to attach multiple documents once the training certification requirements are completed.  The tool will self-guides users through the policies and procedures required by the program, without the burden of extensive training on how to use the system itself.  The tool will enable program operations, with embedded business rules, that represent policy and procedures, and have internal controls that prevent improper actions.  The tool will be intuitive, track and record activities, and enable users to perform correct actions the first time.  The tool will provide a reporting tool that furnishes leadership with near real time management reports concerning FM Workforce Certification Qualifications and be adaptable to reasonable changes in DFMCP policies and procedures.\n\nUNIVERSE OF TRANSACTIONS:\n\nFunding will support financial audit. A Universe of Transaction (UoT) inclusive of all Department of Defense (DoD) Wide Appropriation General Fund (TI-97) information is needed to support reconciliation of fifteen General Fund accounting systems, reconciliation of eighteen business feeder systems to general fund accounting system, and validating UoT capabilities through the audit examinations of DCMA and DoDEA.\n\t\nThe DoD TI-97 UoT requires:\n\u2022 All supporting TI-97 data that rolls up to the DoD financial statement (detailed accounting data reconciled to the financial statement)\n\u2022 Proof of the completeness of all transactional data reported within the UoT (detailed accounting data reconciled to business events)\n\u2022 Ability to extract subset populations\n\u2022 Ability to secure and protect the data within the UoT\n\nThe failure to meet these requirements will result in the Department unable to successfully conduct and pass an audit.\n\nTo achieve these requirements, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is creating a tool called the Auditable Universe of Data Intelligence Tool (AUD-IT).  This tool has the potential to significantly improve DoD\u2019s capability and capacity to handle large volumes of standard and non-standard financial data.  Both an application and analytical platform, the AUD-IT leverages an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications to deliver a complete UoT for TI-97.  \n\nThe first phase of AUD-IT implementation is a proof of concept with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) systems to develop a baseline application and configuration.  When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current timeline for the proof of concept is estimated to be completed by December 2017.\n\nAUD-IT is a joint effort between Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO), Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (ODCMO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), USSOCOM, and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).\n\nThe FY19 funds will be used to develop and implement a SIPR environment for Cost Accounting Framework to meet Operations Security (OPSEC) and Information Security (INFOSEC) requirements"

It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD\u2019s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nToday, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.\n\nThere is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller\u2019s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  \n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress."

OUSD(C) has taken the first step in getting the program back on track.  OUSD(C) and CAPE are working on a joint spiral development effort to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the DoD budget formulation process by consolidating multiple budget data collection points into a prototype for programming and budget data.  This would combine the collection of data performed by the existing applications Standard Data Collection System (SDCS) (Manpower, Forces, Pay Rates, DWCF), Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resources Collection Process (PRCP) (Procurement, Research Development Test & Development, Military Construction and Procurement) and the Comptroller Information System (CIS).  This serves as an important proof-of-concept for future development of NGRMS.  Certain elements of agile development and the waterfall method are applied to provide incremental, staged improvements in functionality.\n\nThe prototype will provide a single, centralized user interface for the DoD components and agencies to submit their budget requests using a common, integrated budget structure, improving efficiency and effectiveness by removing redundancy and need for data reconciliation across multiple budget systems.  This initial phase will support capabilities to collect and feed the budget request data back to existing Comptroller and CAPE legacy systems (CIS, PRCP, and SDCS) to be further processed as part of the President's Budget submission process.  This effort is intended to expand into the next development phase of the NGRMS.\n\nTo prove the concept, OUSD(C) and CAPE have begun to capture and process Manpower (Military End Strength and Civilian FTEs) data.  The purpose of this prototype is to prove that budget submission data can be captured with a commonly defined data structure, transformed, and exchanged back to CIS, PRCP and SDCS in a seamless manner.  OUSD(C) and CAPE are currently working to define a standard set of submission data elements for collection of Manpower data.  The single submission prototype effort is intended to expand to include capture of all budget transaction types and will lead to NGRMS, the modernization and consolidation of multiple budget systems, implementation of next generation capabilities, and eventually, retirement of multiple legacy systems."

The DFMCP meets the business requirement to comply with section 1051 of the FY 2012 NDAA, Public Law 112-8 for improved audit readiness and analytic capability of the 54,000-strong Financial Management (FM) workforce. \n\nThe Department of Defense continues to use the Washington Headquarter Services Learning Management System (LMS) DFMCP system of record. LMS has performed barely adequately in implementing the certification program. A fair assessment by the program office is that despite three years of providing, improving and proliferating training, most FM LMS users and administrators cannot use the LMS proficiently. The result from the users\u2019 perspectives is that the program is flawed, that achievement of certification is unnecessarily difficult, and that instead of enabling the DFMCP, the FM LMS is an obstacle to be surmounted. The FM workforce\u2019s frustration with the FM LMS was raised by the Military Department Comptrollers and the Directors of the DFAS and DCAA as the most significant issue with the new FM Certification Program and an issue requiring immediate resolution.  This culminated with an Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) decision to explore other alternatives to the current FM LMS.  The existing FM LMS is a cumbersome and expensive system.\n\nThis effort is to plan, develop, test and implement the DoD Financial Management Certification Tracking and Reporting Tool (FM-CTRT) as a more efficient and cost effective solution."

Without an automated capability to provide a transactional universe for sampling and evidentiary proof the department will not be in compliance with public law. \n\nThe requested funds will be used to buy \u201cBig Data\u201d software and hardware infrastructure and required contractor services to implement the technology to meet the UoT requirement. \nThis UFR includes subject matter expertise costs for DCFO and funds to be placed on a contract for hardware, software, and labor.  This will not result in hiring additional government personnel. \n\nThe UoT will have the capability to:\n\u2022\tIngest data from multiple accounting and financial feeder systems\n\u2022\tNormalize data from multiple sources providing a common data architecture\n\u2022\tReconcile transactional details to summary financial data\n\u2022\tProvide auditor\u2019s the ability to sample TI-97 detailed transactions\n\u2022\tBusiness Analytics\/Reporting\n\u2022\tDATA Act which is a statutory requirement to be completed by May 2017\n\u2022\tProvide NIPR and SIPR capability for non-sensitive and sensitive data\n\nThis effort is a proof of concept focused on USSOCOM, but will apply to all TI-97 general fund entities.

It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&T activities.  \n\nThis activity implements, maintains, and updates the DoD\u2019s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Additionally this activity places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG."

Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics trust verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories have recently been chartered as a Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and\/or equipment to permit scaling of assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technologies, throughput\/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities in a collaborative nature amongst the core technical laboratories, driven by projected and realized out-year demand.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:\n\n\u2022 Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards\n\u2022 Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening\/verification of select, critical parts\n\u2022 Design verification, i.e., verification\/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.\n\nThese improvements will address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform assessments.\n\nThis project also develops standards and practices in support of assured designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., assured designs and supply chains.\n\nBeginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z, P645, to accurately reflect execution of funds in support of the mission."

DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) IP from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.\n\nThis program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.   It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.\n\nAssurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the USG\u2019s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and EDA tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.\n\nBeginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z, P646, and BA 5 PE 0605294D8Z, P809."

It refines strategies and management planning activities that will: (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted and assured microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.\n\nThis activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&T) organizations and laboratories, the defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&T activities.  \n\nThis activity implements, maintains, and updates the DoD\u2019s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Additionally this activity places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG."

DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) IP from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.\n\nThis program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.  It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.\n\nAssurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the ability of the U.S. Government (USG) to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and EDA tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.\n\nThis project received additional funding starting in FY 2019 to support microelectronics innovation efforts that both enhance national security as well as the supporting DIB and domestic commercial microelectronics suppliers."

The PE helped conduct a full Business Process Re-engineering of the processes used to collect energy information, and publishing an EEIM data standard and a additional effort to build out data stores and portal requirements for Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) management.  Funding is also used to support ASD EI&E Senior Real Property Officer accountability requirements by supporting management and oversight of reconciliation efforts and auditability by determining requirements for the department's Real Property inventory records and asset management processes, business rules and associated data standards.  A major component of this capability is an enterprise EI&E Data Analytics & Integration Support (DAIS) platform coupled with a independent verification & validation capability. With access to real time data through services WSDLS, reports generated through business intelligence provide immediate indicators driving improved and quicker decisions."

Integration with accurate Real property asset, Utilization, Military Construction, Environmental, and installation Geospatial data is equally key to ensuring these decisions for planning and reporting are possible.  It also supports development of The geospatial portal for visualizing energy layers with other EI&E data on installation or area maps for improved spatial analysis.  This portal is the DOD aggregated repository for DoD Common Installation Picture layers.  Additionally, the map viewer is customized and easier for OSD senior staff to manipulate and includes an online catalog of maps, documents and data; and a secure, robust data exchange module. This development supports a range of Joint Staff and OSD customers."

                        "val": "The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds engineering and manufacturing development of CWMD systems, components, technologies, and\/or applications, including system development and demonstration, and initial operational test and evaluation.  The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.\n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis project funds engineering and manufacturing development of CWMD systems, components, technologies, and\/or applications, including system development and demonstration, and initial operational test and evaluation.  The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.\n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

                        "val": "This funding supports the Defense Readiness Reporting System, (DRRS,) the comprehensive readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense mandated under Title 10 U.S. Code.  The system measures in an objective, accurate, and timely manner the capability of the armed forces to carry out the National Security Strategy prescribed by the President, as well as the defense planning guidance provided by the Secretary of Defense and the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nThe transformation of readiness reporting into a new, more comprehensive system under DRRS, presents a number of significant challenges.  Included in these challenges is the expansion in scope of the entities who can, and do report readiness, as well as what they report.  Shifting from solely resource centric readiness reporting to a mission\/capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting, but portrays a far more relevant and holistic picture of readiness.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  Additionally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs.  The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.\n\nThe realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The holistic perspective of the application necessitates its need to operate in multiple domains.  Additionally, the highly complex data structures and visualization tools needed to support the Global Force Management - Data Initiative and critical down-stream consumers of readiness information, must now be implemented within DRRS."

Through this type of advanced information environment, the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force.  This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS."

Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD\u2019s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives)."

This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department\u2019s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades - a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. Better Buying Power (BBP) is the implementation of best practices to strengthen the Defense Department's buying power, improve industry productivity, and provide an affordable, value-added military capability to the Warfighter.  Launched in 2010, BBP encompasses a set of fundamental acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability, cost control, elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy, and promotion of competition. BBP initiatives also incentivize productivity and innovation in industry and Government, and improve tradecraft in the acquisition of services. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.  To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and advance BBP initiatives to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives."

                                        "val": "Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element (PE) has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high-priority Test and Evaluation (T&E) capabilities for joint\/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other Government agencies T&E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP PE support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).\n\n    The JIM funds critically needed T&E investments in the major functional areas of air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; cyber warfare; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments. Examples of project subject matter include highly accurate time-space-position information, electronic warfare test capability developments to address critical testing shortfalls against advanced threats, infrastructure developments needed for testing hypersonic weapon systems, network enhanced telemetry, information assurance and cyber testing and analysis capabilities, end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasures systems, net-centric weapons, and unmanned systems.  CTEIP continues to serve as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and linkages between test and training ranges. \n\n   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as a practical test tool, to link ranges to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing, and to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.\n\n   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.\n\nThe REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high-priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.\n\n   This Budget Activity 6 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.\n\nThe FY2019 CTEIP budget is described in detail below. As part of the DoD reform agenda, the CTEIP budget was reduced for consolidation and reduction of service contracts. The FY2019 includes increased investments in high-priority hypersonic ground and open air range test capability developments and increased investments for critically needed upgrades to DoD Threat Models and Simulations."

                        "val": "The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department\u2019s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201cTesting in a Joint Environment Roadmap\u201d to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to \u201ctest like we fight.\u201d  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability that supports system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing which otherwise would not be readily available to Service\/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs. By linking distributed facilities, as well as providing the necessary tools, services and subject matter expertise, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  \n\nIn 2012, the National Cyber Range (NCR) transitioned from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  The NCR mission is to provide secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments to conduct cyber test, experimentation, and training events.  The NCR supports a wide-range of customers performing Developmental and Operational Testing, Cyber Mission Force Training and Certification, and support for operational contingencies.  In FY 2016, the Department, as a result of a study conducted by DASD(C3&CB), recognized the magnitude of need for increased cyber test and training capacity and capability.  Based on this and other inputs, the Department increased funding in the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) in FY 17 to build out additional cyber T&E capacity based on the National Cyber Range (NCR) architecture.  This increased capacity will also be available to conduct training for the Cyber Mission Force.  The TRMC worked with the Services to identify facilities where this buildout could be accomplished most efficiently.  They also considered additional criteria such as accessibility by acquisition programs, availability of qualified work force, utilities and network availability, timing, and expected cost.  \n\nTo date, TRMC and the Services have identified five sites that are potential candidates.  We have begun detailed design in FY 17, to prepare for beginning the build-out in FY 18.  Once complete, the Department will have well over four times the cyber test and training capacity offered by the current NCR.\n\nThe Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department\u2019s lead for the JMETC program, the National Cyber Range, and oversees both their development and test conduct.  In order to meet the significant growth in requirements, TRMC will use the increased funding for FY 18 to substantially increase cyber test and training capacity by 1) refurbishing the current NCR hardware that is nearing end-of-life and increasing computing capacity to support additional customers; 2) procuring and fielding additional enterprise computational and storage resources for JMETC\u2019s Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDPs) capability; and 3) begin construction of a new high capacity cyber range similar to the NCR."

JMETC provides a test infrastructure consisting of the components necessary to conduct Joint distributed test events by cost-effectively integrating live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) test resources that are configured to support the users' needs.  The JMETC program provides its customers a support team to assist with JMETC products and the conduct of distributed testing.  JMETC\u2019s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  JMETC Program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.  JMETC has grown from four sites in 2007 to well over 100 functional sites by the end of FY17.  JMETC will reduce the cost and time to plan and prepare for distributed joint testing by providing a readily-available, persistent connectivity with network security accreditation support, common integration software for linking sites, and accredited test tools for distributed testing. To support its customers, JMETC also provides extensive expertise in planning, preparing for, and executing the infrastructure for distributed test events.  Additionally in FY 2013, the JMETC mission included developing and fielding the Regional Service Deliver Points (RSDP) to support testing and training.  The RSDPs are a set of distributed computing and storage platforms designed to efficiently meet DoD capacity and capability demands for distributed and cyber test and evaluation (T&E) requirements as part of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  They provide services (i.e. traffic generation, simulation, instrumentation, visualization, and integrated event management), a scalable architecture to increase capacity and capabilities as needed by the user community, a flexible and adaptable infrastructure to support users requirements which are prone to frequent change, and to deliver cost and performance efficiencies (virtualization, rapid reconstitution).  At a high-level architecture view, the RSDP adds enterprise compute and storage resources as well as a platform for distributed and cyber T&E tools and services at multiple classifications necessary to create high fidelity, operationally representative virtual environments, previously unavailable."

Since then, the NCR has executed 200+ events for DOD Customers.  The NCR provides secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration\/federation of cyberspace test and evaluation (T&E) infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission. The NCR is accredited to operate at TS\/\/SI-G\/TK\/HCS-P\/\/SAR.  As a result of recent recapitalization and capacity enhancement efforts, the NCR now has the capability to support up to 8 concurrent events and scale up to ~250K virtual nodes. The NCR concurrently emulates complex (Red\/Blue\/Gray) operationally representative network environments at different classification levels using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) architecture. The NCR Test Automation Tool Suite minimizes human error, enables verification of test environment, ensures repeatable results and reduces event timelines from weeks\/months to hours\/days.  NCR computing assets can be sanitized after exposure to malicious attacks\/malware and restored to a known, clean state. The NCR conducts distributed events with other Cyberspace Ranges via the JMETC MILS Network (JMN) and Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR).\n\nThe NCR conducts Cyberspace Testing, Training and Operational Events for the full spectrum of DoD Customers including Research, Development, Acquisition, Testing, Training and Operational Cyber Mission Forces. The NCR executes wide variety of event types including Science and Technology (S&T) Demonstrations, Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E), Security Controls Assessments (SCA), Cyberspace Operations Training, Cyberspace Tactics, Techniques Procedures (TTP) Development, Forensics\/Malware Analysis) and Cyberspace Operations Mission Rehearsal.  The NCR enables acquisition programs to conduct Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation (T&E) in a representative Cyberspace Environment to identify and close exposed vulnerabilities, evaluate resiliency and positively impact program cost, schedule and performance.  The NCR also supports Training and Certification of Cyber Mission Forces in support of US Cyber Command by enabling operational forces to efficiently evaluate cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment. Finally, the NCR is supporting in real time Overseas Contingency Operations as directed by National Authority.\n\nIn FY 2016, the Department, as a result of a study conducted by DASD(C3&CB), recognized the magnitude of need for increased cyber test and training capacity and capability.  Based on this and other inputs, the Department made the decision to increase funding in the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in FY 17 to build out additional cyber T&E capacity based on the National Cyber Range (NCR) architecture. This increased capacity will also be available to conduct training for the Cyber Mission Force.  The TRMC worked with the Services to identify facilities where this buildout could be accomplished most efficiently.  They also considered additional criteria such as accessibility by acquisition programs, availability of qualified work force, utilities and network availability, timing, and expected cost.\n\nTo date, TRMC and the Services have identified five sites that are potential candidates.  We have begun design and cost estimation in FY17 so that we can begin detailed design and begin build-out in FY 18.  Once complete, the Department will have well over four times the cyber test and training capacity offered by the current NCR.\n\nIn addition, the JMETC NCR Complex supports the Executive Agent for DoD Cyber Test Ranges."

The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) on systems engineering, development planning, program protection, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense (DoD).  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for: (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems, system security, and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance manufacturing, reliability, availability, maintainability, and software and hardware assurance, on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs) and major automated information systems (MAISs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) and program protection plans (PPPs) for MDAPs and MAISs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering, assurance and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) develops new methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) incorporating state of the practice into system engineering for the DoD in both weapon system design, and design tools.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP and PPP for each MDAP and MAIS, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering, program protection, and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  Based on the DASD(SE)\u2019s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense regarding systems engineering, development planning, program protection and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program\u2019s systems engineering, development planning, program protection planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.\n\nThe DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering across the Department.  The DASD(SE) improves DoD\u2019s SE capabilities through advocacy, oversight, policy, and guidance for the acquisition workforce responsible for Engineering, and Production, Quality & Manufacturing (PQM); in Engineering Tools and Environments; and in Specialty Engineering.  \n\nThe DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  The DASD(SE) prepares and submits a bi-annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.\n\nThis PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department\u2019s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of the DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews.\n\nBeginning in FY 2019, this PE will support activities to carry out responsibilities described in Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 855 titled Mission Integration Management (MIM)."

The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.\n\nThis Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

Funding supports policy and guidance for incorporation of alternative means of PNT delivery to augment GPS. Funding also supports the DoD\u2019s PNT Oversight Council and inputs into interagency activities under the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee. \nThe Integrated Planning and Management Project encompasses the National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office's (NMO) responsibilities for establishing overall DoD policy and oversight with respect to the capability development, interoperability, standards, and architecture for National and Nuclear Command Capabilities for our National Leadership.  The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO\u2019s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office with oversight of a wide range of DoD command, control, and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Three overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, National Security\/Emergency Preparedness (NS\/EP), DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Nuclear C2, Integrated Missile Defense, Tactical Warning, Global Strike; and 3) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings.\n\nThe Mission Assurance Risk Management System (MARMS) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management system that directly supports the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Mission Assurance (MA) responsibilities as defined in the DoD Directive (DoDD) 3020.40, Mission Assurance, with the objectives of creating resilience and supporting critical processes to enable the protection of assets and ensuring defense critical missions. MARMS will function as an integration framework spanning multiple security domains that will support risk-informed decision-making, resource investment, and improved synchronization at different levels within DoD. MARMS supports multiple Joint Capability Areas (JCA): Command and Control, Logistics, and Protection. MARMS is an acquisition category (ACAT) III software program and has a \u201chigh\u201d impact value for each of the three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01 and the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253.\n\n\nDefense Architecture Support includes development, analysis, testing and evaluation of DoD IT Enterprise Reference and solution architecture products in support of the DoD's Joint Information Environment and the closely related Mission Partner Environment.  This work also includes improvements to processes that support registration and storage of the Department's enterprise architecture (formerly called DARS). The Department maintains a catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to store, search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data through capabilities provided by the architecture portal.  The portal is a central, federated hub for discovery, accessibility, understandability, and reusability of architectures.  With the ability to import different architecture tool data and display disparate architecture data in a uniform, consistent method for ease of use and understanding.  The portal provides a federated environment for sharing of architectures, mission threads, and other related capability integrated information between various authoritative repositories to increase effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making in a dynamic environment by our customers.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the Defense Architecture Support program focus on: (1) Research and Development of JIE and MPE architectures, (2) Making JIE and MPE architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build \"composite\" integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO's collaborate in the development of federation web services via the Enterprise Architecture and Engineering Panel under the oversight of the DoD CIOs Enterprise Architecture and Service Board to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model, enterprise services, data and technical standards."

In this capacity, the USD(R&E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) R&E programs.  Additionally, the USD(R&E) provides technical support on R&E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the USD(R&E) (OUSD(R&E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&E program and its impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts.  \n\nThe PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the USD(R&E).  The Defense Laboratory Office mission is to craft policy and provide the oversight necessary to both preserve current and develop future DoD in-house laboratory capability such that they continue to generate mission-critical innovations that increase the U.S. military advantage and enhance U.S. national security.  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and supports the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) personnel and quality of workforce; and (3) technology transfer.\n\nThe PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the USD(R&E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&T) program and to ensure that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis project conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds and to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.\n\nThe DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&E programs resides in the USD(R&E).  The USD(R&E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.\n\nThis PE also provides funding for Data Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative\/mitigation actions."

DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result in the loss of this information.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.

For the remainder of FY 2018, the project will collocate the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) joint analysis capability with DoD\u2019s Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO).  The project will integrate collection efforts to produce one list of critical acquisition programs and capabilities that identify the Department\u2019s critical acquisition programs that are tiered for proactive protection efforts.  It will continue to develop links to the security community and adjust to the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 901 mandated reorganization to develop enhanced protection for critical acquisition programs and technologies.  The project is linked with the DoD cross functional team (CFT) on Maintaining DoD Technological Advantage and will begin to adapt joint analysis capability to address any changes in the Department\u2019s strategic direction.  In FY 2018, the program identified an initial set of resources for FY 2019 and will plan future resource requirements for enhanced protection of critical acquisition programs and technologies, adjusted for the FY 2017 NDAA reorganization.  The program will standardize projects to identify feasible protection and safeguards; develop dynamic links with program protection planning activities; and demonstrate advanced analytic tools, coupled with identification of additional information feeds\/sources of data."

This project also manages the Test & Evaluation (T&E) career field and curriculum for the DoD acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&E within DoD, and prepares reports to Congress as required.  Specific activities include the following:\n\n- The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense DT&E (DASD(DT&E)) ensures that test strategies beginning at Milestone A, are documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  DASD(DT&E) reviews and approves\/disapproves the developmental test and evaluation strategy within the TEMPs.\n- Provide formal DT&E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) pre Milestone B, and begin production, Milestone C, with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. \n- Managing the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE).  Over the last four years, the STAT COE has supported over 40 Acquisition Program Managers in the development of statistically optimized test programs.  These efforts have resulted in 175 more efficient and effective test plans and a test cost avoidance of about $160M.\n- Coordinate with the Test Resources Management Center (TRMC) to identify DoD test infrastructure gaps and support development of the TRMC strategic plan.\n- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the SE and development planning processes of the Department.\n- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and cybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).\n- As the T&E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance the T&E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training."

It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department\u2019s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, as well as the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department\u2019s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.\n\nIn FY 2019 CAPE received increased funding from the DoD Joint Service Provider to support the migration, implementation, and sustainment of its DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts. In addition to the one-year increased RDT&E funding in FY 2019 described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding throughout the FY 2019-2023 FYDP to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental solutions. CAPE's  funds are included in the total Internet DMZ Migration amount transferred from JSP to OSD so that CAPE and three other affected OSD Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) can execute their own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ."

It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department\u2019s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department\u2019s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance DoD senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development."

The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. \n- One hundred percent of completed capability development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories, and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.\n- Fifty percent of next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application."

Innovation is the rapid experimentation and development of existing technologies (hardware, software, licenses, databases, analytics, etc.) to create new capabilities and demonstrate their intelligence value in support of warfighter operations.\n\nBeginning in FY 2019, ICI also funds Project Maven which fields increasing amounts of automation to Full Motion Video (FMV) ground exploitation stations for Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude and High Altitude ISR platforms. Maven uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon). Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts  can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from GEOINT. Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform)."

Maven uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon). Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts  can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from GEOINT. Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform)."

Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds research, development, test and evaluations efforts to support planning, development, and sustainment of CWMD technologies, including situational awareness information systems, or other systems as needed.\n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis project funds research, development, test and evaluations efforts to support planning, development, and sustainment of CWMD technologies, including situational awareness information systems, or other systems as needed.\n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

                        "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  The funding increase beginning in FY 2016 represents planned growth and internal reprogramming decisions to accelerate development of a cloud-enabled joint training environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)\n- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and SOF joint training and enabling capabilities that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint collective training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. The enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program will focus efforts on improving, rather than consuming, readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  The JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO and multinational partners. The Joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS\u2019s intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the JS J7 program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD T2 JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, and reporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, IA training; and OSD required training (externally funded).  JKO also expends funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance specific aspects of the training capability as required for J7 support to Combatant Commanders. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content.\n\nUSFK:  FY 2015 is the last year for dedicated funding within the overall program.  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training & Exercise Support program develops simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK\u2019s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.  \n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based capabilities for integration into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements, and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and Coalition Forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard."

This enhances the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  Funding in this account supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  Technical integration enables selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command Headquarter levels.  The funding supports modernization of the Joint Training Environment (JTE) to increase warfighter access to automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE) through web-based and cloud capabilities. \n\nThe Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the Joint Force to be responsive to the warfighters\u2019 pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed JLVC enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and CJCS High Interest Training Issues identified in the Chairman\u2019s Annual Training Guidance."

All projects are evaluated for industrial base risk using fragility and criticality risk criteria, similar to the more familiar probability and consequence risk criteria.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific capability likely to be disrupted.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific capability difficult to replace if disrupted. \n\nIBAS currently focuses efforts and investments in four categories:  Radars, Sensors, and Electronics Sectors; Materials Sector; Munitions and Missiles Sector; and Cross-cutting Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Mitigation."

Key carbon fibers for these applications are unique, essential (not readily substitutable) and proprietary to a single producer\/single factory in one foreign country (Japan).  This foreign, single point-of-failure source of supply, of materials critical to essentially all major high priority space programs, is vulnerable to many severe and long-lasting supply disruption risks (e.g., natural disaster, industrial accidents, future Asia conflicts, foreign government controls and higher foreign commercial market priorities.  Regarding the latter, U.S. program carbon fiber use typically represents a small fraction of total global demand.  Carbon fibers recently developed in the U.S. and commercialized for civilian applications are promising alternatives to imports.  They represent a competitive second source, a more assured supply, cost less, and reportedly perform equal to or better than imports.  Historically, U.S. government programs have relied on single foreign sourced legacy materials and funding is often not available in government programs to test and qualify alternative second sources.  FY 2016 IBAS funds will be used to test and qualify U.S. second sources of commercially available carbon fibers.  With strong cooperation from industry primes, lower tier and material suppliers -- a significant list of promising U.S. government qualification program opportunities are identified for FY 2016 execution (e.g., multiple satellites, missiles and \u201cother\u201d systems).  Planned IBAS projects represent low technology risks, have well defined and near-term program transition points and are low-cost relative to significant industry investments in new, domestically manufactured carbon fiber supplies."

This effort across multiple fiscal years starting in FY 2017 is a collaboration between OSD and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to define and address strategic manufacturing value chain vulnerabilities and technologies, and strengthen workforce skills. This effort includes competitions with \"Support for a prize\u201d. The pilot effort will focus on welding and machining workforce in the Southeast corridor including Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and South Carolina where large ship, aerospace, and automotive growth have created workforce skills and supply chain challenges.  \n\nAccelerator Pilot Project, continuing from FY2016, FY2017 and across multiple future fiscal years, is an effort that comprehensively addresses some of the discovery-to-transition infrastructure shortfalls, including both identifying emerging companies and increasing business viability for startup and other nascent companies focused on advanced manufacturing and application technologies. The Pilot Program will be uniquely focused on hardware and manufacturing based companies.  The comprehensive program will provide access to business strategy and development, mentors in their technology domain, DoD users, investors, and prototype manufacturing facilities.  The first cohort of six to ten startup teams in Phase 1, will encompass the following components: Curriculum and Faculty; Advisor\/Mentor Network; Marketing coalition of public and private partners and sponsors; Solicitation and Selection Plan; \u201cdemo days\u201d at the end of the program."

                        "val": "The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. \n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis project funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. \n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.\nAssessments of the ability of future forces to achieve objectives at the campaign level. These assessments include wargaming, qualitative, and quantitative analytic methods. They will both inform and be informed by the Support for Strategic Analysis (SSA) defense planning scenarios (DPS). They will identify risk and potential trade-space among force structure, capabilities, and readiness to inform senior leader decision-making."

Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance\/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  \n\n     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space, maritime, cyberspace) of the joint information environment (JIE), to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse and secure joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  \n     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint \/Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the DoD Information Network (DODIN) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies."

Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance\/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  \n\n     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space, maritime, cyberspace) of the joint information environment (JIE), to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse and secure joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance and mission assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  \n     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint \/Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the DoD Information Network (DODIN) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies."

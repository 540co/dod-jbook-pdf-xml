Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. As such, funding in FY19 is reduced from prior years due to shifts in the Army S&T portfolio that emphasizes far term investments as well as consideration of the contributions of this project to current Army Readiness.  \n\nThis work supports Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) operational concepts by demonstrating precision aerial delivery and airdrop from non-traditional platforms."

This Project demonstrates combat feeding equipment with reduced logistics (in component parts, weight, volume, fuel, and water) and labor requirements, while improving the quality of food service. The Project, a Department of Defense (DoD) program for which the Army has Executive Agent responsibility, provides technology development for Joint Service Combat Feeding. The DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board provides oversight for this project. Demonstrated field feeding equipment is transitioned to Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Product Manager Combat Support Equipment (PM CSE), Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA)\/Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), and\/or United States Air Force Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) Program Office. Demonstrated ration technologies are transitioned to the Combat Feeding Directorate for Advanced Component Development & Prototypes under Program Element (PE) 0603747A (Soldier Support and Survivability).\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier\/Squad Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602787A (Medical Technology) and PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers, which are rapidly deployable\/re-locatable, require no Military Construction, and need limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and assesses the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under Program Element (PE) 0602786A\/Project VT4. Demonstrated EBC equipment is transitioned to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the S&T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nIn FY19, this project merges into XW6, Small Unit Expeditionary Maneuver, along with 242\t, Airdrop Equipment."

Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.\n\nPromising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for human medical products, and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides). The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and\/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small group human study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct safety and effectiveness clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large pivotal trials in diverse populations will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and small safety and effectiveness studies involving humans according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA or EPA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.\n\nBlast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.\n\nProject 810 matures and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nProject 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and medical procedures and practice guidelines intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin, muscle, nerve, vascular and bone tissues in wounded Service Members . Additionally, this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events, determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces, and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces. \n\nProject ET5 conducts validation studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics, medical devices, procedures, and rehabilitative strategies intended to minimize long-term effects from battlefield injuries. This project supports advancing technology supporting clinical and rehabilitative solutions to restore function of ocular and visual system post injury; and advancing regenerative techniques to restore the function and appearance of damaged tissues by regenerating skin, muscle, nerve, vascular and bone tissues in wounded Service Members.\n\nProject FH4 matures, validates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies), validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors. \n\nProject MM3 supports the Medical and Survivability technology areas with laboratory validation studies and field demonstrations of biomedical products designed to counteract myriad environmental and physiological stressors, as well as materiel hazards encountered in training and operational environments to protect, sustain, and enhance Soldier performance. The key efforts are to demonstrate and transition technologies, as well as validate tools associated with Soldier survivability, injury assessment and prediction, assessments for post-concussive syndrome, and enhancing performance during continuous operations. The three main thrust areas are\n(1) Physiological Health and Environmental Protection, (2) Injury Prevention and Reduction, and (3) Psychological Health and Resilience. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services. \nWork funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0602787A and the Defense Health Program.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD; US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Ft Detrick, MD; US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; US Army Institute of Surgical Research, Joint Base San Antonio, TX; United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Ft Rucker, AL; the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD; US Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Joint Base San Antonio, TX."

The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nResearch conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1)\tPrevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2)\tBacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3)\tViral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4)\tDiagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n\nResearch is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).\n\nWork is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.\n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under Program Element 0603807A, Project 808.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases."

This effort selects candidate vaccines for various types of malaria, including the severe form of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (Plasmodium vivax), prepares technical data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans and conducts testing of promising malaria vaccine candidates in humans.

Concepts such as a unitary projectile geared towards medium armor targets, a full bore submunition with a highly reliable triple function fuze, a concept that increases the size and fuze volume of the Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) bomblet and incorporates high reliability fuzing while maintaining the traditional lethal mechanisms of DPICM. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the efforts optimize the concept of bomblet\/system design and component space allocation to accommodate system level development and demonstrating concept performance through modeling and simulation. Efforts mature system level designs of unitary solutions and improve initial system level performance. Efforts continue to mature designs and exploit alternate technologies to mitigate risk; develop evaluation criteria to assess concept performance; integrate component technologies into system level solution that are effective against target sets."

The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  SSL technology has demonstrated the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor\/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA's) future capability opportunities for leap-ahead technology for directed energy."

This Project executes the Army's APS program to mature and demonstrate APS technologies in order to increase protection against current and emerging advanced threats while maintaining or reducing vehicle weight by reducing reliance on armor through the use of other means such as sensing, warning, hostile fire detection and active countermeasures. This Project develops an APS Common Architecture that defines the component interface standards and component specifications enabling adaptable APS solutions that can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

These jamming or damaging effects can slow our battle tempo, disrupt fire control solutions, or prevent vehicles from completing their mission. This effort focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of optical systems that protect sensors and Warfighter vision from pulsed, continuous wave and future laser threats to maintain fire control capability and situational awareness.

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio..   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, assignment methods, and performance metrics for individuals and units, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Work in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nEfforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602785A (Manpower\/Personnel\/Training Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.

These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This Project evaluates new selection measures, assignment methods, and performance metrics for individuals and units, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Work in this Project will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602785A (Manpower\/Personnel\/Training Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Science and Technology priorities of the Army Chief of Staff, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas, and the Army Human Capital Strategy."

Specifically the hard-kill APS portion and modeling and simulation efforts will be addressed by the United States (U.S.) Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC). This effort supports the Army's APS program to mature and demonstrate APS technologies to reduce vehicle weight while reducing reliance on armor through the use of other means such as sensing, warning, hostile fire detection, and active countermeasures to achieve increased protection against current and emerging threats. This effort supports the development of an APS Common Architecture enabling adaptable APS solutions that can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required. This effort compliments work being accomplished under PE 0602601A\/Project C05, PE 0602618A\/Project H80, PE 0603004A\/Project 232, PE 0603005A\/Project 221, and PE 0603270A\/Project K16."

The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.\n\nWork in this Program Element (PE) supports the Army Science and Technology Environment and Terrain Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

For aeronautical systems of all types (i.e., fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, munitions, missiles, rockets, etc.), this endeavor will continue maturing model-centric conceptual design software technology to support pre Milestone-A Defense acquisition processes, enabling application of physics-based analysis of alternatives, technology trade-space exploration, and cost implications. For fixed-wing aircraft, this will include, but will not be limited to, high-fidelity physics-based analysis capabilities for coupled aerodynamics, structural dynamics, propulsion, and flight controls in support of flight certifications (e.g., air worthiness, store carriage and release, etc.), mission planning for fielded and new systems and associated upgrades, and acquisition decisions associated with exploration and design analysis of future manned and unmanned aerial vehicle concepts. Additionally, it will include implementation of foundational software improvements necessary to begin development of physics-based design analysis tools for future hypersonic weapon systems (High Speed Strike, Tactical Boost-Glide, and Manned\/Unmanned Conventional Prompt Global Strike). For rotorcraft, exemplars will include aeromechanics analysis associated with maneuvers, airframe-propulsion system integration, and weapons carriage and release, as well as infrared suppression analysis, chaff trajectory prediction, debris ingestion analysis, and loads prediction capability necessary for structural airworthiness assessments. These capabilities will be deployed in support of the FVL Program, as well as for sustainment of existing rotorcraft-based programs and associated upgrades, such as the ITEP. For RF antenna design analysis, will further mature computational electromagnetics capabilities to assist in design and evaluation of next generation radar for aircraft, ships, and ground-based platforms; will demonstrate capability for assessment of electromagnetic hazards on ordnance and will optimize computational methods for electronic warfare assessments and evaluation of multiple antenna systems on a single platform. For Naval Ships (surface and submarine), will further mature conceptual and early modeling capabilities in sync with detailed design and analyses, to realize full-lifecycle management of systems and platforms, and for conducting AoAs."

                        "val": "This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day\/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments). Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day\/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots\/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day\/night\/adverse weather conditions. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).   \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM)."

Project 002 demonstrates tools and methods for compliance with environmental laws relevant to conservation of natural and cultural resources while providing a flexible realistic training environment for mission activities. The Army also requires the ability to assess, establish, upgrade, and secure infrastructure while in theatre to enable deployed force operations. This project matures and demonstrates tools for robotic and autonomous agile infrastructure modification and custom designed construction for expeditionary structures on demand. Project 025 demonstrates pollution prevention tools and methods to minimize the Army's use and generation of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes. Project 03E focuses on technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and technologies to empower rapid fielding of next generation energetics, propellants and munitions.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities for Air Missile Defense, Next Generation Combat Vehicle, and Network\/C3I, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nThis PE is fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology).\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the United States (U.S.) Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This project assists Army installations and operations in achieving environmental compliance. Army facilities are subject to fines and facility shutdowns for violations of federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Efforts under this Project enable the Army to reduce environmental constraints at installations while complying with the myriad of federal, state, local, and host country environmental regulations and policy. In addition, this project matures capabilities to assess, establish, upgrade, and construct infrastructure to project power and enable deployed force operations. Current and planned efforts enable the Army to perform additive and advanced manufacturing for deployed force infrastructure, support robotic and autonomous engineering during combat operations, and ensure infrastructure resiliency. Technologies demonstrated aim to reduce the cost of resolving compliance issues for the Army, sustain the viability of testing and training ranges, protect critical resources, and expand capacity to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk\/threat and dynamic environments.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Military Engineering and Environmental Technology, Simulation and Computing Portfolio. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas, supports the Army Strategy for the Environment, and supports the Army Modernization Priority for Next Generation Combat Vehicle, Air Missile Defense and Network\/C3I."

Technologies matured within this Project inform the Army of potential environmental threats, opportunities and impact to mission; to understand the environmental threat in urban and industrial contested environments; and rapidly sense and assess the presence and extent of dangerous compounds in battlefield environments. A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies. Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with myriad federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water.

Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops and critical fixed and semi-fixed assets. Protection measures support force projection in areas such as air and sea ports of debarkation, dispersed small units, and units operating in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations and future vertical lift. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. \n\nForce protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating in disbursed small units over complex and urban terrain and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blast and weapon effects from advanced and emerging threats. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply and manned-unmanned teaming and demonstrates infrastructure health monitoring assessment technologies to support emerging projection challenges in complex, contested environments such as distributed sustainment over large distances. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for \"upfront engineering\" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization priorities for Next Generation Combat Vehicle, Air Missile Defense, Network\/C3I, and Future Vertical Lift. This work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832\/Project D8Z.\n\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology).

Efforts demonstrate seamlessly integrated communications and information security technologies across all network tiers, ranging from unattended networks and sensors, through maneuver elements using airborne and space assets. Project EL4 matures and integrates antennas, wireless networking devices, protocols, and software; network operations tools and techniques; and combines these with current fielded networks and systems in a series of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) network modernization demonstrations to measure their technology readiness levels and assess them against currently fielded network architectures in an operationally relevant environment. Project EL5 matures information security devices, techniques, services, software and algorithms to protect tactical wired and wireless networks against modern network attacks; generates and distributes tactical cyber situational awareness; and focuses on configuration, operation, monitoring, defense and network reconstitution in bandwidth constrained tactical environments while reducing the operator workload required to conduct these functions.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology) and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nWork is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Center Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This venue performs field based risk reduction (FBRR) and technology readiness assessments (TRAs) by evaluating the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of candidate Army science and technology (S&T) and best of Industry efforts to support tactical network modernization. The yearly themes for the integrated capabilities event are determined by the maturity of the tech base programs across the Army S&T command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I) portfolio. On an annual basis, those programs at or approaching TRL 6 will be solicited for participation based on their maturity to enter TRA in the FBRR environment located at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB-MDL) (Fort Dix). Upon the completion of technology selection, themes will be developed that inform Army S&T, CERDEC Thrust Areas, Army Warfighting Challenges, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) key technology imperatives, and the overall development of the Mission Command Network of 2025 and beyond."

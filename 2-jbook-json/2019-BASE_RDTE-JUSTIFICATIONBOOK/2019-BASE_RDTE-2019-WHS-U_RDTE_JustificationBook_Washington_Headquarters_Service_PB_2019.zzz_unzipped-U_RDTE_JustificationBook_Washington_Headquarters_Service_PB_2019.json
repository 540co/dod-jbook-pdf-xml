One of the tenets of this priority is to expand the Department's ability to access leading edge technological innovations through commercial partnerships.  The funding DIUx executes is critical as it incentivizes non-traditional defense sector companies to work with and invest in advancing DoD future capabilities.  \n\n Some of the projects undertaken include:  \n- Hardened Network Defense that provides warfighters improved network security by obscuring vital services and data, thereby significantly decreasing the ability of advancing cyber threats to map, attack or exploit tactical systems.\n- Command, Control, and Situational Awareness web-based software platform that supports user's ability to visualize relevant activities and operational metrics, collaboratively plan and approve defense activities, and monitor\/manage subsequent.  DIUx projects signal investment targets for venture capital opportunities.  While these are small when compared to the DoD total budget, the 3rd party investment multiplier they generate are without equal."

Accordingly, DIUx requirements are driven by DoD customers in the Services, Defense Agencies, and Combatant Commands.  They come to DIUx with their most challenging and most compelling technological problems.  DIUx works to solve challenges and issues for the Department in areas such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Autonomy, Human Systems, Information Technology, and Space.  DIUX specialized staff carry out the niche functions of its three teams:   Venture, Foundry and Engagement.  The Venture team identifies emerging commercial technology and explores its military applicability.  The Foundry team works with technology that is still maturing and is not yet ready for production and the Engagement Team introduces entrepreneurs to military problems and the military to entrepreneurs."

RDT&E funding is required to support the DDS mission, which includes the ability to build software prototypes to prove out concepts for mission critical projects identified by the Department.\n\nEnsuring that DDS has RDT&E capabilities will increase DoD\u2019s ability to leverage DDS\u2019s unique technical expertise to determine which private sector software development best practices and\/or technology work best for the Department.

The former is dependent on RDT&E funding that supports the ability to acquire the most current technological solution and\/or support from vendors well versed in the most advanced technological solutions.  \n\nThe requested RDT&E funds will enable DDS to build prototypes and implement proof-of-concept tests for some key OSD projects. These projects will support missions in and out of theater, as well as long term goals of the department to modernize its offensive and defensive technological capabilities.  DoD interest in leveraging DDS to operate in this area to solve hard and impossible problems is persistent.

Ultimately, the purpose and goal of the team is to ensure that solutions reach the hands of end users, including warfighters, in short timelines, so that compound problems from the existing problem sets do not persist."

These problems span across classified and unclassified problem spaces, and range from software development, piloting the use of commercial software as a replacement for antiquated government systems, and modernizing and refactoring broken systems.  Some examples of current projects include: replacing the MEPCOM Integrated Resources System, reimagining the user interface and associated databases for the Defense Property System, devising a hard and software solution to counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems that attack warfighters in theater, and developing a novel and modern approach to network defense.  Our team is comprised of digital experts with backgrounds in policy, contracts, design, and engineering who collectively use their private industry and federal government experience to identify solutions to problems and rapidly devise and implement solutions."

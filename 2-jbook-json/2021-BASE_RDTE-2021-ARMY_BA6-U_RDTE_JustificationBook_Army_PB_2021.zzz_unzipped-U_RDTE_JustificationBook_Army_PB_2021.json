This PE originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, but scope was expanded to address emerging world threats. Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories (SILs) and hardware\/simulation in-the-loop facilities. These battlefield simulators represent adversary systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) in order to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems.\n\nArmy Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products developed or fielded under this PE support Army-wide, non-system-specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army\/DoD and Tri-Service capabilities to eliminate duplication of effort. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and Government Accountability Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Threat Simulator Investment Working Group."

This Project originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, but scope was expanded to address emerging world threats. Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for the United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories (SILs) and hardware\/simulation in-the-loop facilities. These battlefield simulators represent adversary systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communication systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) in order to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems.               \n\nArmy Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products developed or fielded under this Project support Army-wide, non-system-specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army\/DoD and Tri-Service capabilities to eliminate duplication of effort. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and Government Accountability Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.) Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Cyber Test and Training (PM CT2) formerly Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Threat Simulator Investment Working Group."

NETT is used by TCO teams to replicate the tactics of state and non-state Threats and is supported by a robust TCO development environment. The Cyber domain is the most rapidly changing domain in which our systems operate. NETT program will continue research of these capabilities and will use an in-depth process to clean, fix, sustain, modernize, and integrate required Threat tools, tactics, and techniques that will be needed during T&E. Focus areas include: continued Threat integration, instrumentation, distributed collaboration between multiple users, targets and attack visualization, data collection and remote agent development."

Multi-spectral Aerial Targets include realistic surrogates, actual high performance threat aircraft, and virtual target computer models. Current and emerging weapons systems require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess weapons systems effectiveness in the operational environment. This project encompasses a portfolio of full-scale, miniature, and subscale fixed wing\/rotary wing targets, virtual targets, ancillary devices, and associated control systems. For accurate threat portrayal that properly stresses weapons systems during test and evaluation, aerial targets must exhibit the flight characteristics, threat signatures, and other performance factors to represent or emulate relevant and validated threats. This Project funds: the long-range planning necessary to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirements; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation, production, and modernization; execution of the validation process to ensure that aerial targets accurately represent the threat; as well as storage and repair parts. The Army is the Test Enterprise Reliance lead for Rotary Wing Targets and Towed Target development and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing High Speed Aerial Target."

The Reagan Test Site with its remote location and one of kind instrumentation systems provides a strategic test environment that cannot be replicated. In order to continue its critical mission of testing missile systems that are of paramount importance to the defense of the nation, the RTS instrumentation systems must be continuously updated and upgraded to support the emerging technologies being developed by the Department of Defense (DOD) such as hypersonics and other advanced weapons systems. Without modernization these instrumentation systems face obsolescence or degraded capability and the inability to provide the critical data needed for continued materiel development. Without instrumentation on par with the technologies being utilized in emerging systems, the materiel developer will be unable to complete their test programs or pass programmatic milestones toward deployment. These funds provide modernization of the radar, telemetry, optics, range safety, communications, command\/control and other equipment essential to meet test and evaluation requirements of the Services and DoD agencies. The RTS instrumentation is required to support data collection for test & evaluation assessments and operational decisions that have strategic implications for the Army, Navy, Air Force, United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other customers. RTS, located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Funding will enable RTS to continue to meet customer objectives and sustain the required instrumentation suite."

In addition, this approach will enable centralized command and control of the telemetry equipment increasing efficiency in mission preparation and execution. The telemetry back-end processing chain is currently comprised of discrete frequency- specific hardware components that are replicated for each telemetry channel required for a test event. This activity will develop a scalable frequency-agnostic, software-based solution that runs on commodity computer servers. More complex missions (e.g., Over-the-air (OTA) operational testing of the Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS)) will continue to require more telemetry channels, but this activity will avoid much of that future cost. This effort will provide enough hardware to increase capacity of the telemetry system."

These Projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team. Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) funds will be used for modernization of outdated instrumentation in support of developmental testing for Army, Department of Defense programs.\n\nTest Network Modernization (TNM) will upgrade existing test data networks to ensure infrastructures are capable of providing reliable and secure transport of data and communications for ATEC test activities. Applied Environments Modernization (AEM) program will upgrade antiquated Environmental labs for climatic and dynamic testing with new cascade refrigeration units, climatic chambers, vibration test systems, x-ray cameras, a real-time radiography system and full spectrum solar lights. Robotics\/Unmanned Aerial Systems (R\/UAS) Instrumentation Suite will develop and procure instrumentation for testing controlled and autonomous ground and aerial robotic systems. System of Systems Cooperative Engagement Test Infrastructure (SCETI) will provide for the development of systems to conduct systems-level Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) testing for both aircraft and ground systems in a distributed environment. ATEC Fiber Modernization will provide all ATEC Test Centers with a revitalized fiber network to complement the TNM program. Telemetry Systems Modernization (TSM) will modernize outdated telemetry systems with new equipment designed to enhance the technical and spectral capabilities currently available. This new telemetry equipment will also provide for a remote controlled operational environment."

Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems. Project focus is to address Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E)-identified Army test realism shortfalls.\n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than 1.500 million per year or 7.500 million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.\n\nThe DOT&E annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army's abilities to create realistic operational environments. The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE) project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&E. ILTE is a portfolio of related development efforts that will deliver a system of systems to provide a Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) and instrumentation suite that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments. ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan. ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future weapon systems in a realistic operational environment. ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning System (GPS), encryption components, and integrate operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield. Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles. This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs), M1A2 Abrams, M2A4 Bradley, Stryker, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Apache AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests."

Since existing range radar instrumentation is aged beyond useful life and cannot adequately support emerging test requirements, the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) recapitalizes and develops modern instrumentation radars to replace obsolete tracking and surveillance radars at U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities, which include: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ. The project will deliver capability in two block increments: Block I will recapitalize or replace existing radar systems, and Block II will develop a Long Range Radar which is compliant with ATEC's Test Capability Requirements Document (TCRD). The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army with critical testing data essential for the development of next generation technology and advanced system capabilities. The RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability. The planned solution to meet program requirements consists of four primary items: Long Range Single Object Tracking Radars (SOTR), Long Range Multiple Object Tracking Radars (MOTR), Medium Range Radars (MRR), and Short Range Radars (SRR). The resulting systems will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but will improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers. \n\nThis Project will procure commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and\/or modified commercial off-the-shelf (MCOTS) radars for both the MRR and SRR solutions, and a combination of recapitalization and COTS\/MCOTS replacement for the Long Range SOTRs. Also, the project will conduct Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for upgrading three Long Range MOTRs."

This capability is comprised of an ATD system built for the Title 10 LFT&E environment and associated biomechanics data and analysis tools. The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with underbody blast (UBB) events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment devices are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The device produced by this Project will be used to satisfy a critical need for scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB."

PM CT2 will work with Blue and Red Teams to establish processes which facilitate open network tests under the red team authority, coordinate with PMs on CABT efforts on behalf of ASA ALT and report to ASA ALT on new cyber vulnerabilities. Blue teams will work cooperatively with acquisition programs to make sure all security measures are taken throughout the program's lifecycle, ensuring cyber resiliency. Blue teams are essential to help military operators assess, protect and defeat the presence of cyber security threats across Army Acquisition Programs.\n\n\nWill focus on the continuation of certifying candidate teams. The goal is to certify enough teams to allow acquisition programs the flexibility to find a certified Blue Team that meet their program's schedule and cost and can be incorporated early on in the program. CABT vulnerability assessments will provide data analytics to report trends and lessons learned. A web portal will serve as a one stop shop for both candidate and certified Blue teams to obtain and maintain their certification."

RAND Arroyo Center draws researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines. Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations: Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in three major research areas: Personnel, Training, and Health; Forces and Logistics; and Strategy, Doctrine and Resources.  RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid\/long-term concerns. Current priorities include: implementation of the National Defense Strategy; total force readiness; Army modernization priorities; ongoing operations and dynamic force employment; reform business processes; multi-domain operations; and soldier-centric investments and soldier and family resilience. Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues. RAND Arroyo research is sponsored by the Secretary, Chief of Staff, Under Secretary, Vice Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs of Staff; Assistant Secretaries of the Army, and Army Major Commands. RAND Arroyo is governed by AR 5-21 and receives Army guidance through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology). The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan. Each research project is sponsored by a General Officer or Senior Executive Service who is continually involved in research evaluation and feedback. RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis."

In addition, responsibilities include provision of the totality of the logistics and municipal services required to maintain a strategically vital mission support infrastructure in a remote Pacific island chain 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii. Kwajalein's flexible electromagnetic frequency spectrum, equatorial locale, deep water, and unmatched instrumentation make the nation's space and missile operations possible. In addition, the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS) on Kwajalein is the Department of Defense's (DoD) only land-impact missile testing site, providing an increasingly vital Test & Evaluation (T&E) capability. \n\nThe U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll \/ Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (USAKA\/RTS), located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). USAKA\/RTS supports test and evaluation of major Army and DoD missile and space acquisition programs and provides New Foreign Launch surveillance and space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), the U.S. Air Force, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs. USAG-KA provides Base Operations (BOS), Infrastructure and Services (Projects DW7, DW8, and DW9) support to the USAKA\/RTS mission and other resident Programs (i.e. Army missile defense, Air Force & Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Air Force Space Fence, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational \/demonstration\/ validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and space experiments). Base Operations Services at Kwajalein Atoll are conducted predominantly through a contracted workforce with governmental oversight. These PE-funded contracts provide: installation\/base operations and maintenance for all facilities, logistics, and security; power generation fuel supporting the installation and radars; transportation; and mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optic cable system. \n\nThe Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) utilizes Project DX2 to provide civilian pay, manpower service contracts, supporting Information Technology (IT), equipment, and associated costs specifically identified and measurable to plan, manage, coordinate, and execute Information Technology Services Management at Army Kwajalein Test Ranges. This Project provides C4IM services in accordance with the Department of Army Pamphlet (DA PAM) PAM 25-1-1 and the Army C4IM Services List."

The purpose of Concepts Experimentation is to clarify and mitigate risk for current and future forces. Experiments and projects inform Army futures concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent user requirements in the future Army. Army experiments use the combined resources of Army Battle Laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinement, and assessment of future force concepts. Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) will integrate and assess Army Concepts and Force Design phases with Army-level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) enhances Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development in support of Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions. This PE provides for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs, enabling development and deployment\/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force. Early Synthetic Prototyping enables a wargaming and experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions. This PE provides funding for Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA) that physically integrate, assess and evaluate networked capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. This PE also provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration.\n\nThe Soldier-Centered Analysis For Future Force Project (33B) will provide early application of human performance and human figure modeling tools in the development of Soldier-focused requirements to shape technology for Future Force development. These efforts include design analyses, constructive simulations, and Soldier-in-the loop assessments to ensure that manpower requirements and workload and skill demands are considered, avoiding information and physical task overloads and taking optimum advantage of aptitudes, individual and collective training, and numbers of Soldiers for an affordable Future Force."

The purpose of these efforts is to learn and mitigate risk for current and future forces. Experiments inform Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent user requirements in the future Army. Army experiments use the combined resources of Army Battle Laboratories, operating force units, research laboratories, materiel developers, industry, and academia to collaborate in the development, refinement, and assessment of future force concepts. These experiments refine and validate concepts for current and future forces to inform capability developments and requirements determination. Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, this Project has supported the Army's Simulation-Based Experiments (SIMEXp) to integrate and assess near-, mid-, and far-term future force concepts, force designs, and capabilities. In support of the Army Vision and Army Strategy, experimentation focuses on the latest Multi-Domain Operations Concept and operational and organizational concepts for the Army of 2028 and beyond. To refine the Multi-Domain Operations Concepts, Army experimentation expands linkages to multi-Service and Joint experiments."

These resource requirements provide AFC and FCC resources to execute as lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) and central coordination for Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA). These requirements support critical research, development, test and evaluation for Early Synthetic Prototyping and enable war-gaming and experimentation that engages soldiers across the Army to gain insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions. FCC integrates accelerated capabilities development activities between Army proponent force modernization managers as well as Joint \/ Sister Service coordination. AFC\/FCC conducts Joint Warfighter Assessments to physically integrate, assess and evaluate adaptive capability sets to accelerate the systems acquisition process that provides DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army."

These capabilities are required to support developmental testing requirements of high priority Army systems supporting Army modernization efforts. Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing. A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This Project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems, upgrades to existing radars to extend their economic life, common data collection and analysis tools, non-intrusive instrumentation to test Unmanned Ground Vehicles and sensors, high speed - high definition digital imaging systems to capture missile flight events, and automation software to improve data collection of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing."

A subordinate unit of ATEC, the OTC employs MS&I to provide a realistic operational test (OT) environment, conduct test monitoring and control, and perform data analysis. OTC develops and adapts Army training simulations (such as Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) and One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)) for use in OT, reducing the demand for Army test units and test cost by simulating tactical engagements, adjacent & higher headquarters units, mission command message traffic, and battlefield effects. OTC provides test monitoring and control through video monitoring, Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled networks, and integration with Army mission command systems to collect real-time position location and status tracking to ensure test safety and provide status of data collection devices. OTC uses video equipment, data collection devices, and software to collect and analyze system performance during test. MS&I funding is used to adapt\/integrate current Army training simulation capabilities to function with new Army systems, purchase commercial off-the-shelf systems, and develop and sustain OT-unique simulation and instrumentation systems. The MS&I program also funds the technical expertise and hardware to sustain cyber security of OTC's technology capabilities, and provides for minor data collection device development and sustainment to support systems undergoing OT."

Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, experimenting and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest-priority Army and threat systems. Products are leveraged within the Army Futures Command and the Program Manager \/ Program Executive Office (PM\/PEO) community to exercise constructive design influence over materiel development and to provide credible engineering-level underpinning and input to the Army Analytical Community. While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this PE are also directly leveraged for urgent materiel releases and support to current operations.\n\nThis PE provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army pursues its modernization priorities and ensures readiness through the fielding of lethal and survivable systems for multi-domain operations. PE funds engineering level SLV analysis in the areas of Long Range Precision Fires systems, Next Generation Combat Vehicles, Future Vertical Lift, Network\/C3I, Air & Missile Defense, Soldier Lethality, and other highest Army priority efforts in the threat competencies of ballistics, electronic warfare, and cyber. \n\nVulnerability assessments funded by this PE are conducted across the spectrum of multi-domain battlefield threats to include: guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; cyber threats from insiders to external nation states; and directed energy weapons. Many different kinds of technical capabilities are used to generate these analyses, including specialized equipment, modeling & simulation, and experimental facilities. This PE ensures these capabilities can represent a credible live, virtual, or constructive hostile environment required for vulnerability assessment, thus enabling evaluators, developers, users, and decision makers to make informed SLV judgments for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability and lethality details: enable properly informed decisions concerning acquisition and production; maximize Army overmatch in systems and tactics; inform investment priorities; and mitigate system weaknesses prior to actual combat. \n\nTechnical data and analysis results funded by this PE are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures accurate and consistent treatment of survivability and lethality across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's analytical community as it conducts analyses of alternatives and other studies. The U.S  Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) and ATEC\/AEC integrate the SLV work program into Army's formal Evaluation process to ensure ATEC can comply with its legally-mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability."

This PE supports independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62 (\"Airworthiness of Aircraft Systems\"), and is essential for assuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This PE performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of nearly 20,000 assigned Army aircraft. This PE also supports: management\/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management\/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support for major development\/modification and future systems\/ subsystems requirements of the Program Executive Officer for Aviation (PEO AVN) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO); and management of test and evaluation processes in support of the airworthiness qualification process. The Airworthiness Certification PE also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models, and supports the application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft. \n\nThis PE also supports: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g., National Airworthiness Council) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g., Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS)); and early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects such as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, Advanced Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Modular Open System Architecture, and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives."

This Project supports independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62 (\"Airworthiness of Aircraft Systems\"), and is essential for assuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This Project performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of nearly 20,000 assigned Army aircraft. This Project also supports: management\/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management\/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support for major development\/modification and future systems\/ subsystems requirements of the Program Executive Officer for Aviation (PEO AVN) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO); and management of test and evaluation processes in support of the airworthiness qualification process. The Airworthiness Certification Project also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models, and supports the application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft. \n\nThis Project also supports: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g., National Airworthiness Council) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS)); and early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects such as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, Advanced Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Modular Open System Architecture, and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Types of support include:  (1) unique atmospheric analysis and sampling to include atmospheric transmittance, extinction, optical scintillation, infrared temperature, aerosol\/smoke cloud dispersion characteristics, and ballistic meteorological measurements; (2) test event forecasting to include prediction of sound propagation for ballistic firing tests, specialized prediction of light levels and target-to-background measurements, and predictions for electro-optical testing and ballistic artillery\/mortar firing; and (3) advisory and warning products such as go\/no-go test recommendations for ballistic and atmospheric probe missiles, smoke\/obscurant tests, hazard predictions for chemical agent munitions disposal, monitoring dispersion of simulant clouds for chemical\/biological detector tests, simulated nuclear blasts, and weather warnings for test range safety.  This PE provides technical weather support to Army and Joint Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at: White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This PE develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army\/DoD RDTE requirements. It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers along with replacement\/ upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems. Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel\/weapons developers and project\/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R (Department of Defense Financial Management Regulations).  This PE enables more effective test scheduling and execution, and is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental and operational test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities."

Types of support include: (1) unique atmospheric analysis and sampling to include atmospheric transmittance, extinction, optical scintillation, infrared temperature, aerosol\/smoke cloud dispersion characteristics, and ballistic meteorological measurements; (2) test event forecasting to include prediction of sound propagation for ballistic firing tests, specialized prediction of light levels and target-to-background measurements, and predictions for electro-optical testing and ballistic artillery\/mortar firing; and (3) advisory and warning products such as go\/no-go test recommendations for ballistic and atmospheric probe missiles, smoke\/obscurant tests, hazard predictions for chemical agent munitions disposal, monitoring dispersion of simulant clouds for chemical\/biological detector tests, simulated nuclear blasts, and weather warnings for test range safety. This Project provides technical weather support to Army and Joint Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at: White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This PE develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army\/DoD RDTE requirements. It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers along with replacement\/ upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems. Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel\/weapons developers and project\/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R (Department of Defense Financial Management Regulations). This PE enables more effective test scheduling and execution, and is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental and operational test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities."

The analysis products funded by this PE are leveraged to support Materiel Acquisition decisions and influence the design, development, and sustainment of Army weapon\/materiel systems in support of the current and future force in the areas of Long Range Precision Fires, Next Generation Combat Vehicles, Future Vehicle Lift, Network\/Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Air and Missile Defense, Soldier Lethality and other Army Priority efforts.\n\nAs the Army's center for materiel systems analysis, the CCDC DAC provides the technical capability to support Army and DoD decision makers throughout the entire acquisition process in responding to analytical requirements across the full spectrum of materiel.  The DAC's unique in-house, consistent, integrated analytical capability is a critical asset that provides Army leadership with timely, independent, unbiased, reliable, and high quality analysis to support complex decisions required for Current Operations and the development of the Future Force.  The DAC's integrated set of skills and tools are focused on the highest Army Priorities with a core mission to deliver objective analysis, experimentation, and data across the entire life cycle to ensure Readiness today and a more lethal Future Force tomorrow.  \n\nThis PE develops and certifies system level performance and effectiveness data across a broad range of capabilities such as target acquisition, probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, personnel and vehicle survivability, mobility, network, system reliability, and several additional capability areas used in Army studies.  The PE funds the development of item-level performance methodology, and Models and Simulations (M&S) for the current and future operational environments and emerging threats.  The M&S capabilities support the development, linkage and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined arms environment.  This M&S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling framework that is unique to the DAC and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness analysis and prediction capability that can be utilized to support trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems\/technologies.  \n\nThis PE funds the Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), to develop critical tools, methodologies, policies, guidance and educational materials required to help acquisition programs achieve required reliability during the acquisition process.  The CRG develops and applies engineering approaches to assess the reliability of Army materiel and provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby, reducing logistics footprints and life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for materiel.  The CRG has developed an integrated set of skills and tools focused on its core competencies to be responsive in delivering objective data and analysis across the entire life cycle to ensure Readiness today and a more lethal future force tomorrow."

The effort also answers scientific and technical intelligence requirements, provides materiel for realistic testing and training, and aids in the development of countermeasures to threat systems, materiel, and technologies. Operations have increased the amount of captured threat materiel that require immediate exploitation to develop countermeasures and force protection measures for US forces.

Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. OTC conducts independent operational tests that provide significant data to Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts. This PE finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.

Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs) and Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to the Army test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) as the joint OTA.  Mission support for JTE includes supporting two Joint Tests under the Joint Test program, and assigned special projects. ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, Suffolk VA, United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) J81 (Hawaii), and Marine Corps Warfighter Laboratory (Quantico, VA) with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support. JTE supports Joint Tests until these Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM."

These operational tests are required by public law (Title 10 USC 2399).  This Project finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential to conduct realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.\n\nOTC consists of four forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air and Missile Defense Test Directorate,\nFort Bliss, Texas; Fires Support Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and the Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate, Fort Huachuca, Arizona) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Fort Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives in support of the Army's modernization priorities. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Customer Tests, Early User Tests, Limited User Tests (LUT), Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), and Follow-On Operational Tests (FOT).  OTC also supports Army Futures Command's Soldier Touch Points and other early assessments of potential new systems the Army may acquire."

AEC is the lead agent to plan, direct and evaluate all required program testing and is the unbiased, independent authority for reporting on system progress. AEC is the focal point in test strategy development, system safety verification, and data analyses from early developmental consumer tests through operational tests. AEC develops Critical Operational Issues and Criteria (COIC) in conjunction with AFC to narrow the focus of testing to what is essential.  AEC reviews system requirements to ensure they do not drive unnecessary testing.  AEC provides critical independent assessments on the effectiveness, suitability, and survivability to include cyber and electronic warfare; safety of materiel solutions; and viability of emerging technologies and engineering change proposals in order to support major acquisition\/fielding decisions including but not limited to acquisition milestones, materiel changes, and materiel release.\n\nAEC is responsible for all assigned developmental and independent operational evaluation of Army materiel, information and acquisition systems, an inherently governmental mission.  This core evaluation mission cannot be reimbursable. AEC must remain independent from the development community. AEC assists the Chief of Staff of the Army decision making process by supporting Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) processes as well as supporting the AFC through the CFT concept. AEC evaluates operational effectiveness by determining if the system provides intended benefits to the Force.  AEC determines impacts to readiness through Human Systems Integration (HSI), Unit Systems Integration (USI), and Army Systems Integration (ASI), as well as doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities and policy (DOTMLPF-P) impacts, AEC evaluates ballistics survivability and lethality, adversarial assessments\/threat computer network operations, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (CVPA), and electronic warfare (EW) (attack, protection, and support) in support of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2016 Section 1647, establishment of Cybersecurity and Electromagnetic Affects (CEMA).  AEC manages, plans, and executes Information Assurance (IA) operational assessments during annual Combatant Command and Army Service exercises in support of the congressionally mandated Office of the Secretary of Defense Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD DOT&E) assessment, and performs the operational test agency (OTA) duties for the Ballistic Missile Defense System.\n\nThis PE funds direct civilian labor and minimum non-labor requirements to include: Temporary Duty (TDY), personnel training, career development, supplies and equipment, hardware, software, and other external Other Government Agency (OGA) support as well as methodology development required to evaluate emerging technologies and instrumentation requirements.\n\nAEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Evaluation Directorate (funded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Evaluation Directorate, Integrated Suitability & Methodology Directorate, Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate, Soldier & Support System Evaluation Directorate and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a lean headquarters element as AEC receives staff services from the Army Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters (ATEC HQ). The AEC primary competencies are: identify what decision makers need to know; plan and direct test and evaluation strategies; evaluate operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability and safety; and provide senior leadership unbiased advice on Army programs."

AEC provides critical independent assessments on the effectiveness, suitability, and survivability to include cyber and electronic warfare; safety of materiel solutions; and viability of emerging technologies and engineering change proposals in order to support major acquisition\/fielding decisions including but not limited to acquisition milestones, materiel changes, and materiel releases.\n\nAEC is responsible for all assigned developmental and independent operational evaluation of Army materiel, information and acquisition systems, an inherently governmental mission. This core evaluation mission cannot be reimbursable. AEC must remain independent from the development community. AEC assists the Chief of Staff of the Army decision making process by supporting Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) processes as well as supporting the AFC through the CFT concept. AEC evaluates operational effectiveness by determining if the system provides intended benefits to the Force. AEC determines impacts to readiness through Human Systems Integration (HSI), Unit Systems Integration (USI), and Army Systems Integration (ASI), as well as doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities and policy (DOTMLPF-P) impacts, AEC evaluates ballistics survivability and lethality, adversarial assessments\/threat computer network operations, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (CVPA), and electronic warfare (EW) (attack, protection, and support) in support of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2016 Section 1647, establishment of Cybersecurity and Electromagnetic Affects (CEMA). AEC manages, plans,\nand executes Information Assurance (IA) operational assessments during annual Combatant Command and Army Service exercises in support of the congressionally mandated Office of the Secretary of Defense Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD DOT&E) assessment, and performs the operational test agency (OTA) duties for the Ballistic Missile Defense System.\n\nThis PE funds direct civilian labor and minimum non-labor requirements to include: Temporary Duty (TDY), personnel training, career development, supplies and equipment, hardware, software, and other external Other Government Agency (OGA) support as well as methodology development required to evaluate emerging technologies and instrumentation requirements.\n\nAEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate; BMD Evaluation Directorate (funded by the MDA); C4ISR Evaluation Directorate; Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate; Readiness and Analytics Evaluation Directorate (RAED); Soldier Evaluation Directorate; and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a lean headquarters element as AEC receives staff services from the ATEC HQ.  The AEC primary competencies are:  Identify what decision makers need to know; plan and direct test and evaluation strategies; evaluate operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability and safety; and provide senior leadership unbiased advice on Army programs."

                        "val": "This Program Element (PE) promotes the Army's Modeling and Simulation (M&S) strategy, defined by five guiding priorities: (1) formulate Army M&S policies; (2) develop and employ management processes for models, simulations and data; (3) develop M&S standards, architectures, networks and environments; (4) develop\/employ new M&S tools and simulation technology; (5) develop an M&S workforce. Specifically, this PE focuses on priorities 3 and 4.\n\nM&S Standards, Architectures, Networks and Environments: The consistent use of standards, architectures, networks and environments advances the goal of interoperability. The Army coordinates with Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) partners along with industry and academia to develop\/employ standards that promote collaboration and facilitate the sharing of tools, data and information. The Army oversees procedures and processes for the appropriate use of standards to foster common formats and increase M&S and data reuse. The Army ensures these standards, architectures, networks and environments are readily accessible and can be reliably applied by users.\n\nM&S Tools and Simulation Technology: The Army must have credible M&S tools and data to support the full range of Army organizational missions and functional responsibilities. M&S results that are timely and credible enhance decision making. The Army must develop and accredit reliable M&S tools so that decision makers and senior leaders benefit from the results and thus support the continued development, integration and use of such tools. To ensure credibility and reliability of results, M&S managers, developers and users must make the capabilities, constraints, limitations and assumptions of their M&S tools readily accessible. PE 0605718A provides for the development and employment of tools in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making. Moreover, these tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose in order to provide timely, credible results."

The ASB dates to November 1951 when the Secretary of the Army, Honorable Frank Pace Jr., appointed twelve outstanding scientists and industrialists to a scientific advisory panel to assist him and the Army's leadership in creating an effective, economical, and progressive fighting force using existing technology and industrial resources. Three years later, this panel was expanded and officially designated the Army Scientific Advisory Panel (ASAP), with its first formal meeting held on November 16, 1954. In 1977, with the passage of FACA, the ASB was created to replace the ASAP.\n\nThe ASB provides the Army with a resource of world-class scientists, engineers, technologists and operational experts as well as business, policy and managerial specialists from the private sector, academia, non-DoD government agencies and former senior military officers. Its members volunteer their expertise and time to address those critical national security challenges for which the Army's leadership seeks independent and unbiased technical advice. The ASB focuses on issues of importance to large segments of the Army, and its products are delivered in a candid and timely manner.\n\nThe Board is composed of 20 voting and 20 non-voting members, each serving three-year terms, and consultants who serve one-year terms. Membership is carefully monitored to ensure that diverse disciplines and points of view are represented. The Secretary of the Army appoints the Chair and Vice Chair from the ASB membership. The ASB Chair also serves as a non-voting observer to the Defense Science Board. ASB membership is augmented by a small number of consultants who are appointed to provide specialized expertise for ASB studies."

This Project partially funds the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate in international forums, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This Project also includes the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U.S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill). This Project also partially funds the Five Power Senior National Representatives, Army (SNR (A)), the Technical Cooperative Program, Bilateral SNR(A)s, and Army armaments working groups with many nations."

Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership. Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues. This PE includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation, along with initiatives to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&T knowledge management information technology and to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment. Conducts Army S&T strategic planning, prioritization, analysis and assessment (Projects 720 and 727). This PE also addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers. Project 730 provides funding for assessments in attitudes and opinions, longitudinal trends in Soldier and leader perceptions, and emerging issues that provide senior Army leaders with information on Soldiers' perceptions to inform personnel policy and program decision-making concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues. Project 731 provides funding for support for Army high performance computing centers. Project 733 provides funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process, while Project C16 supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems. Project DW3 supports Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE) Implementation with systems engineering, architecture, and test and certification of Army Acquisition Systems. Finally, this PE funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (Project C18). Coordination of this PE with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Ft. Belvoir, VA; the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS; Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft.

In 1982, Congress, through the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) established the SBIR program to foster the involvement of US based small businesses in federal research and development (R&D). The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small, high-technology firms in the federal R&D endeavor and give driven businesses the opportunity to provide innovative R&D solutions in response to critical Army needs.  The STTR program expands the public\/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small business and the nation's premier nonprofit research institutions. The most important role of the STTR program is to foster the innovation necessary to meet the nation's scientific and technological challenges in the 21st century. The SBIR\/STTR support services include program and technical advisory support services on a broad level. The Army SBIR\/STTR Program Management Office mission requires synergized, integrated business solutions that concentrates on small business technological advances, and eliminates redundancy in a codified and consistent method that reduces confusion and ambiguity for the thousands of small businesses that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs."

The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers. The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&S savings. FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers an Annual Program Review to facilitate sharing of lessons learned between science advisors at combatant commands, assists Combatant Commanders (COCOMS) with their annual Science and Technology Conferences. FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office). FAST supports warfighters in contingency operations with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by: AMC, Redstone Arsenal, AL; and Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Project will result in the development and demonstration of new, safe, reliable and environmentally acceptable munitions.\n\nProject 297 - Munitions Survivability & Logistics: This Project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply. Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements. Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness. Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated. The early stages of force deployment are especially critical. Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets. These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater. Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life. This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.\n\nProject 857 - DoD Explosives Safety Standards: This Project supports the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation efforts of the Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Safety Standards Board. It supports explosive safety effects research and testing to quantify hazards and to develop techniques to mitigate those hazards in all DoD manufacturing, testing, transportation, maintenance, storage, disposal of ammunition and explosives operations, and also to develop risk based explosives safety standards. Results are essential to the development and improvement of quantity-distance standards, hazard classification procedures, cost effective explosion-resistant facility design procedures, and personnel hazard\/protection criteria.\n\nProject 858 - Army Explosives Safety Management Program: This Project establishes, validates or modifies explosives technical safety requirements per Department of Defense Manual 6055.09 and Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-64, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. Project activities promote Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) of new and innovative explosives safety technologies that improve the survivability of Army personnel, facilities, and equipment as well as improve the health, safety and welfare of the general public (with highest priority directed to combat theater of operations).\n\nProject 859 - Life Cycle Pilot Process: This Project supports the implementation of the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan through technology investigations, model based process controls, pilot prototyping, and industrial assessments. It will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements, and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products. Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP). LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation. In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs) \/ No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB). LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.\n\nProject F21: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program funding ensures interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC). In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition, and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy, and general product improvements. This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility under the auspices of international agreements to include NATO working groups, the Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU), and information\/ data exchange agreements. Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to support United States industrial base production and affordable Department of Defense pricing through increased economies of scale. FY 2021 funding will support NATO and JBMOU artillery and small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation, and test operations.  \n\nProject F24: Conventional Munitions Demilitarization (Demil): The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization technology Project supports the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) responsibility per Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5160.68 to plan, program, budget and fund a Joint Service Research and Development (R&D) program that develops capability and capacity as well as technology and facilities to support the SMCA mission to demil and dispose of conventional ammunition stored in the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A).  The program goals include SMCA efforts to increase efficiencies and effectiveness to reduce the demil stockpile; reduce processing costs including packaging, handling and crating; and increase capacity through improved demilitarization capabilities and processes. Project F24 includes activities: (1) to establish requirements and develop processes to focus investments, assess capabilities, analyze alternatives, and recommend and implement R&D projects; (2) to improve products and processes that support existing capabilities; (3) to develop or improve demil methods and processes related to advance the primary demilitarization core thrust areas of destruction, disassembly, removal, resource recovery and recycling, and waste stream treatment; (4) to ensure safe and environmentally acceptable demil operations; (5) to transition R&D products to United States Army depots or plants as well as commercial facilities performing demil; and (6) to mitigate risk and close-out project activities."

Key thrust areas are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers, advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements, improved estimation and future prediction of munitions reliability.  Within each thrust area, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness. Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated. The early stages of force deployment are especially critical. Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets. These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater. Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life. This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.  All research and development initiatives will be supporting the cross functional teams and the multi domain operations modernization objectives."

In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 50mm ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition, and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy, and general product improvements. This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability\/ compatibility under the auspices of international agreements to include NATO working groups, the Joint Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding (JBMOU), and information\/ data exchange agreements.  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire weapon and munition products to support United States industrial base production and affordable Department of Defense pricing through increased economies of scale.  FY 2021 funding will support NATO and JBMOU artillery and small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation, and test operations."

Project goals include SMCA efforts to increase efficiencies and effectiveness to reduce the demil stockpile; reduce processing costs including packaging, handling and crating; and increase capacity through improved demil capabilities and processes. Project F24 includes several activities: (1) to establish requirements and develop processes to focus investments, assess capabilities, analyze alternatives, and recommend and implement RDT&E projects; (2) to improve products and processes that support existing capabilities; (3) to develop or improve demil methods and processes related to advance the primary demilitarization core thrust areas of destruction, disassembly, removal, resource recovery and recycling, and waste stream treatment; (4) to ensure safe and environmentally acceptable demil operations; (5) to transition RDT&E products to United States Army depots or plants as well as commercial facilities performing demil; and (6) to mitigate risk and close-out Project activities.   \n\nDuring Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Project F24 will focus efforts on fielding alternative capabilities to open burn and open detonation. In FY21 Project F24 will also conduct conventional ammunition demilitarization operational testing on a Castalia system."

In addition, this PE provides support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address environmental quality requirements under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Program.\n\nThe Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change to the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal. The Project involves systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life. It provides support to the system acquisition community (Program and Project Managers) to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process. The goal of the effort is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs, including efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities.\n\nThe Pollution Prevention Tech Support Project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction, Airborne Lead Reduction, and Low Global Warming Potential (LGWP) environmental quality technology programs, which support Cross Functional Teams and the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment."

It also provides funds supporting similar functions at the United States (U.S.) Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (Project XW7 Command HQ - ARI), and provides funds for Army Headquarters to study and improve the Sexual Harassment \/ Assault Response and Prevention program (Project FJ2 Army SHARP RDTE). \n\nATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, and assessments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. Additionally, ATEC is a Direct Support to Army Futures Command (AFC). ATEC provides testing and independent evaluation support to AFC Cross Functional Team (CFT) efforts including risk reduction support to experiments, demonstrations, requirements, research, development, and acquisition. As such, ATEC priorities are aligned to the Army's Modernization priorities. \n\nProject M65 includes staff\/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information\/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), APG, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) at APG, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WDTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC) at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) at Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of approximately 2,300 developmental tests; approximately 53 operational events; and approximately 900 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs. ATEC's total authorized workforce amounts to a $1.7 billion program in direct and reimbursable funding. \n\nProject XW7 provides the non-Army Management Headquarters Activity (non-AMHA) management and administrative support that enables the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) to accomplish its research mission and includes personnel\/manpower execution and oversight. ARI's behavioral and social science research provides effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints. ARI is the only Science and Technology (S&T) laboratory that conducts research to enhance the Soldier lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, and leader development). \n\nProject FJ2 provides Army Management Headquarters a critical research capability to improve the Army Sexual Harassment \/ Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) program, with a specific focus on prevention.\n\nThis PE does not finance test facility operations, test instrumentation, or test equipment."

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 this contract achieves three goals: (1) to inform sexual harassment prevention research efforts (e.g., Consortium Research Fellows Program), (2) examine the nature of offending within the military to inform effective sexual assault prevention efforts, and (3) assess the efficacy of training\/prevention\/outreach efforts related to sexual assault, in particular but not limited to male service members. Ongoing efforts to meet the first goal will explore the nature of sexual harassment in the Army, identify the organizational costs related to harassment (e.g., increased turnover, lower job satisfaction, and job performance), and examine the role of sexual harassment as it relates to sexual assault within the continuum of harm. Based on these studies, the performer will recommend effective sexual harassment prevention strategies. Studies will ensure that Army SHARP programs build climates for dignity and respect free of sexual harassment. Some of these efforts may be achieved through a collaboration with the Consortium Research Fellows Program.\n\nTo meet the second goal, studies will examine behavioral patterns in offending within military sexual assault cases. For instance, behavioral patterns may reveal the nature of military sexual assault or identify potential vulnerabilities that could lead someone to perpetrate sexual assault. Studies may also be informed by offender patterns observed in research using administrative data sources. Based on this research, the performer will identify ways to reduce risk of sexual offending behavior, recommend ways to improve skills and abilities that will bolster one's ability to engage in healthy relationships, and inform effective sexual assault prevention practices. \n\nTo meet the third goal, research will (1) conduct male-specific assessments and (2) conduct other assessments that will assess the efficacy of training\/prevention\/ outreach efforts related to sexual assault. The research will characterize the behaviors associated with military men's victimization and how they differ from those of service women, men's decision processes to file a formal report of sexual assault, and their experiences with the military sexual assault response systems. In particular, the research will focus on male victimization that occurred during military service rather than childhood sexual assault. Based on this research, the performer will identify ways to improve tailored recommendations for responding to and supporting male victims. This research will improve DoD prevention and response for male Service members. To meet the second part of this goal, the research may conduct assessments to evaluate the efficacy of training\/prevention\/outreach efforts related to sexual assault. This may involve conducting evaluation research to assess the effectiveness of individual programs or practices. Based on this research, the performer will determine whether these programs are effective and propose ways to improve SHARP efforts. This research will ensure that SHARP programs deliver effective training\/ prevention\/outreach."

For instance, behavioral patterns may reveal the nature of military sexual assault or identify potential vulnerabilities that could lead someone to perpetrate sexual assault. The research may also be informed by offender patterns observed in research using administrative data sources. Based on this research, the performer will identify ways to reduce risk of sexual offending behavior, recommend ways to improve skills and abilities that will bolster one?s ability to engage in healthy relationships, and inform effective sexual assault prevention practices.\n\nTo meet the third goal, research will (1) conduct male-specific assessments and (2) conduct other assessments that will assess the efficacy of training\/prevention\/outreach efforts related to sexual assault. The research will characterize the behaviors associated with military men?s victimization and how they differ from those of service women, men?s decision processes to file a formal report of sexual assault, and their experiences with the military sexual assault response systems. In particular, the research will focus on male victimization that occurred during military service rather than childhood sexual assault. Based on this research, the performer will identify ways to improve tailored recommendations for responding to and supporting male victims. This research will improve DoD prevention and response for male Service members. To meet the second part of this goal, the research may conduct assessments to evaluate the efficacy of training\/prevention\/outreach efforts related to sexual assault. This may involve conducting evaluation research to assess the effectiveness of individual programs or practices. Based on this research, the performer will determine whether these programs are effective and propose ways to improve SHARP efforts. This research will ensure that SHARP programs deliver effective training\/prevention\/outreach."

The results for each goal will be reviewed for potential for military and Army- feasible solutions to be developed in the prevention spectrum including but not limited to:  universal education, awareness, messaging, social norms marketing, early identification and targeted education and prevention and remediation, accession marketing and policy and deterrent adjudication processes.  2021 research emphasis will be placed on a balance between potential short-term, high impact prevention efforts and longer term efforts that will require more fundamental research for full understanding or require shifts in military culture before the results can be fully exploited and realized."

Its function is to: 1) support test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition programs of strategic importance to the national defense; and 2) provide space operations and intelligence data (Space Situational Awareness, object tracking & identification) in support of United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), acting as a high value contributing sensor to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network. Due to its unique geography and instrumentation, RTS is able to provide unmatched data collection capabilities that provide critical test data for programs of national interest to include: Army Missile Defense; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational, demonstration, and validation tests; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs; NASA ionospheric studies; space debris tracking; and data collection in support of space experiments. \n\nFunding in this Program Element (PE) covers management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and(DoD) missile systems for the (RTS). Funds also provide contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts. This PE provides contractors to accomplish key operations and maintenance functions for RTS instrumentation suites and also provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optic cable system. Funds provide the expertise required for operating and maintaining a number of one-of-a-kind radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems. These systems include: the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site; Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center. The Advanced Research Project Agency Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment radars located at RTS are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability. The Millimeter Wave Radar is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world, providing critical intelligence data. Funding also enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS. This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS. Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense , and Aegis Weapon System), and NASA's space experiments."

Its function is to: 1) support test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition programs of strategic importance to the national defense; and 2) provide space operations and intelligence data (Space Situational Awareness, object tracking & identification) in support of United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), acting as a high value contributing sensor to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network. Due to its unique geography and instrumentation, RTS is able to provide unmatched data collection capabilities that provide critical test data for programs of national interest to include: Army Missile Defense; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational, demonstration, and validation tests; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs; NASA ionospheric studies; space debris tracking; and data collection in support of space experiments. \n\nFunding in this Program Element (PE) covers management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and  (DoD) missile systems for the (RTS). Funds also provide contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts. This PE provides contractors to accomplish key operations and maintenance functions for RTS instrumentation suites and also provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optic cable system. Funds provide the expertise required for operating and maintaining a number of one-of-a-kind radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems. These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site; Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center. The Advanced Research Project Agency Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment radars located at RTS are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability. The Millimeter Wave Radar is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world, providing critical intelligence data. Funding also enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS. This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS. Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense , and Aegis Weapon System), and NASA's space experiments."

Modernization of these systems is a core component of ensuring overmatch on current and future battlefields. Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, funding for these efforts was transferred to PE 0606003 \/ Project FI9 (Counter Intel and Human Intel Modernization) from PE 0303028A (INTEL SPT TO FORCE XXI) \/ Project FG2 (Counterintelligence & Human Intel Modernization).\n\nBASE Line of Effort:\nCI Support to Force Protection (CIFP) ($1,063K) provides for updating the Army's Threat Management Information Sharing System, the Army Counterintelligence Operations Portal (ACOP), and partnering with other Service CI entities on a joint CI analysis system development project.  Will support development and testing of software code integrating existing and new algorithms to multiple data source to record, identify, sort, and prioritize behaviors.  \n\nOCO Lines of Effort:\nThe Joint Service Counter C4ISR Initiative ($1,000K) conducts technical analysis and research focused on centers of gravity within the C4ISR architecture of adversary weapon systems that enable successful kinetic and non-kinetic engagements.  The Army will use the intelligence provided from this effort to inform the development against key adversary weapon systems. \n\nEmerging GEOINT Collection Integration ($887K) provides rapid integration of emerging GEOINT capabilities and analysis techniques significantly ahead of the traditional integration timelines.  The 513th MI BDE has been given access to pre-release algorithms and capabilities, and can begin, test, development, and validation activities years prior to traditional processes.  This capability allows GEOINT focused CME support to identify difficult CT issues and deliver appropriate capabilities needed today in every theater.  Each MIB-T that provides GEOINT support will leverage the capability, and its applicability is world-wide.  The project funds software and testing to extract, analyze, and validate brand new and emerging classified data sources. \n\nIdentity Intelligence Analytic Repository (I2AR) ($1,250K) is the Department's only automated information system for linking biometric and forensics data with associate information and intelligence data to create the Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) and other intelligence analytic products.  These efforts will increase the efficiency in which intelligence analysts can make  linkage between identities discovered thro7ugh the use of biometrics and forensics by DoD and derogatory information and intelligence. \n\nPursuit and Exploitation (P&E) ($1,000K) provides operational gear to support operational needs requirements by filling known intelligence gaps for force deployed.  The equipment also provide advancements and risk reduction for current and future system and Programs of Record (PoR).  The P&E efforts also aims to improve the support to Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) that requires an increase in the range of detection, identification, and geolocation of adversarial signals of interest.  There is also a need to continue to decrease size, weight, power, and cost in order to give the Army more flexibility for employment.  This funding provides software and material necessary to upgrade existing systems and improve support to LRPF and cyber Electronic Warfare Activities.  These efforts help ensure capabilities remain relevant in delivering timely, actionable intelligence and targeting to facilitate decision making at the tactical edge.  The equipment also provide advancements and risk deduction for current and future systems and Program of Record."

The funds support the retention of technical subject matter expertise, independent of the number of assigned projects. The infrastructure funds also support Institutional Review Board functions, research technical support, statistical support, grant writing assistance, and other essential functions for maintaining research in MTFs. The funds do not support research, but provide the infrastructure support enabling MTF investigators to compete for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) research funds.\n\nThe Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS) Laboratory Infrastructure Support provides management support for research infrastructure at selected overseas laboratories and research sites that conduct bio surveillance and basic to late-stage clinical research and evaluation of investigational products, such as biologics, drugs, protectants, technologies, and knowledge products to treat\/prevent infectious diseases for the purpose of protecting the Warfighter; this is accomplished through collaborative efforts with the respective host nation governments.

For NDAA 1647, the Army was directed to assess and mitigate twenty-four weapon systems NLT December 31, 2019. For NDAA 1650, the Army was directed to assess and submit a mitigation strategy for twenty-five installations, NLT 31 December, 2020. To support this mandate, the HQDA G-3 directed DAMO-CY to evolve the two congressional mandates into two enduring Army programs: the Cyber Operational Resiliency Assessment-Platforms (CORA-P) to replace NDAA 1647, and the Cyber Operational Resiliency Assessment-Installations (CORA-I) to replace NDAA 1650. The aim of CORA-P\/I is to reduce the Army's risk to adversarial cyber intrusions or attacks that compromises the Army weapon and installation systems.  In compliance with the congressional mandates, DAMO-CY's performance objectives is to provide governance oversight over the execution of CORA-P\/I phased vulnerability assessments to support o the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) cycle. These deliverables include identifying the means to mitigate CORA-P\/I vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds cyber vulnerabilities evaluations of major weapon systems in alignment with Section 1647 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, and of critical infrastructure in alignment with Section 1650 of NDAA 2017. Efforts in this PE will: 1) identify, assess, and develop and identify non-recurring engineering (NRE) to mitigate operational risks from cyber vulnerabilities to critical Army weapon systems in an operational configuration; and 2) assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the information and control systems that underpin Army facilities and critical infrastructure by inventorying and assessing Facility-Related Control Systems (FRCS).\n\nWeapon systems evaluations will assess and provide NRE recommendations to mitigate operational risks emanating from a peer or near-peer adversary profile in accordance with existing test\/lab requirements of through acquisition cycle. Where applicable, these evaluations will include tabletop exercises, lab assessments, and exercise\/operational assessments of Program Executive Officer Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) and ground weapon systems. Cyber hardening efforts will be informed by the vulnerability assessments reports (VAR) generated through the assessment and prioritization process.  Prioritization will be based on mission criticality, impact to readiness, and threat. When applicable, this PE also provides for Red Team enhancement to support Combatant Command mission-level cyber vulnerability assessments. \n\nEvaluations of cyber vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure will focus on Task Critical Assets, Defense Critical Assets, and on units with high priority Quadrennial Defense Review missions and their supporting infrastructure. When necessary, this PE will provide for the training of teams to conduct cyber vulnerability evaluations on critical infrastructure. Once trained, these teams will conduct cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (Blue Teaming), adversarial assessments (Red Teaming), and assist with conducting assessments of cyber dependencies, vulnerabilities and threats in accordance with DoDI 8501.1 \"Risk Management Framework.\" Funding will also provide for Contractor subject matter expertise to conduct Security Control Assessments and Deep Cyber Resiliency Assessments."

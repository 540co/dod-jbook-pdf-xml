The JCD&E Enterprise includes the combatant commands, the military services, the National Guard Bureau, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The Joint Staff J7 executes the JE program and leads the JCD&E Enterprise.  \n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, joint experiments originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in combatant command Integrated Priority Lists and Joint Urgent Needs documents submitted, to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  JE nominations undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Enterprise to confirm suitability for experimentation, alignment to strategic guidance and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  The resultant list is termed Warfighter Challenges (WFCs), and constitutes experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution.  These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Executive Council.  \n\nExperimentation plans are developed in consultation with JE partners, and consolidated into an annual program of joint experimentation, known as the JCD&E Campaign Plan.  The Executive Council meets regularly to review and approve the progress of the efforts in the campaign plan.  The JCD&E Campaign Plan allows the Department to synchronize experimentation efforts over multiple years to avoid duplication of effort and to create synergy among the defense experimentation entities.    \n\nJE experiments and activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) improvements.  JE tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JE addresses topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  Experiments and efforts produce a range of outcomes inclusive of fundamental joint doctrine, inputs to major policy documents such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance (DPPG). In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JE mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts like Irregular Warfare, Integrated Financial Operations and Joint Operational Access that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans."

Led by the Joint Staff, the JCD&E Enterprise includes the combatant commands, the military services, the National Guard Bureau, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  \n\nJE projects and activities develop and examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) improvements.  JE tackles joint capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex experimentation leading to solutions.  JE addresses topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  Joint Concept Development & Experimentation (JCD&E) projects produce a range of outcomes including inputs to major policy documents such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and Defense Planning and Programming Guidance (DPPG) and input to the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS).\n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&E projects originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in combatant command Integrated Priority Lists and Joint Urgent Needs documents submitted to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).\n\nProject plans are developed in consultation with JE partners, and consolidated into an annual program of work.  The Synchronization Board and the Joint Capabilities Board meet regularly to review and approve the progress of the efforts in the program of work.  The JCD&E Program of Work allows the Department to synchronize JCD&E efforts over multiple years to avoid duplication of effort and to create synergy among the defense experimentation entities."

JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DOD's resource allocation structures. JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (COCOM) and maintains liaison offices at all major COCOM locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the US. It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues and for capabilities development and validation in support of the Unified Command Plan (UCP) assigned missions."

JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DOD's resource allocation structures. JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and maintains liaison offices at all major COCOM locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the US. It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.

The basis of the functional structure of the IO Range is the integration of existing ranges, laboratories, information warfare centers, and other Government facilities that currently support IO\/Cyber test, training, exercise, and experimentation events. Capabilities at the selected sites are securely connected and integrated into the IO Range. A key feature of this concept is a persistent, secure connection that links the sites together, allowing the exchange of data and the visualization of effects as we employ capabilities. Creation of a \u201cvirtual range\u201d based on persistent connections significantly reduces the amount of lead-time required to set up each new warfighter event. The long-term goal for the IO Range is to be a full spectrum IO\/Cyber Range supporting: operations security (OPSEC), computer network operations (CNO), electronic warfare (EW), military information support operations (MISO), and military deception (MILDEC). This environment enables the warfighters to visualize non-kinetic weapons effects, understand the intricate and interactive effects generated by kinetic and non-kinetic weapons and achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO\/Cyber capabilities as they have with kinetic capabilities."

JI&I-funded endeavors aim to improve US and coalition capabilities to conduct coordinated operations.  Necessarily, JI&I-funded projects most frequently address Command & Control (C2) and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) - the capstone capabilities for integrating disparate elements of military force for joint and coalition operations.  The JI&I Program supports tasks and projects associated with integration & interoperability of the C2 Portfolio including coordination of C2 operational architectures, standards, and policies. Likewise, JI&I partially funds integration and decision support activities associated with DOD executive level C4 management and oversight.  \n\nThe JI&I Program deliver outcomes conforming to joint integration missions:\n- In concert with the separately funded Joint Systems Integration Command (JSIC) and Joint Fires Integration Interoperability Team (JFIIT), JI&I resources investigate joint C2\/C4ISR shortfalls and ascertain characteristics of DOTMLPF remedies to meet mission requirements. The remedies are then pursued through partnerships with Component force development authorities and acquisition sponsors. \n- Consistent with the role as operational sponsor for joint C2, JI&I underwrites Joint Combat Capability Developer (JCCD) activities compiling operational requirements for C2\/C4ISR capability development and integrated testing. \n- Delivers assessment and recommendations for improvement of interoperable Combat Identification (CID) and Situational Awareness (SA) capabilities among United States forces, interagency organizations, and allied\/coalition forces;\n- Establishes joint data standards and cross domain solutions to facilitate future system interoperability and integration.

The GIG stresses interoperability and CWID leverages the rapid pace of C4 technology advancements. CWID is a Chairman\u2019s annual event that enables the US combatant commands, national civil authorities, and international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability and exploring new partnerships. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for warfighter and national civil authorities\u2019 validation of those solutions. Interoperability Trials (ITs) are the activities used to address the core coalition and interagency interoperability objectives selected each year. ITs strive to address warfighter requirements and interoperability deficiencies. The selection of trials is dependent upon the annual overarching objectives, the host combatant command\u2019s priorities, Coalition\/State\/Agency desires to partner in a proposed trial, interagency participation, and the desires of invited coalition participants. CWID is an integral component of the JV 2020 conceptual template."

The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA\u2019s overall Log R&D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment."

It also enables authoritative data sources distributed throughout the Enterprise to be leveraged, and reduces unnecessary replication of data repositories.  The Netcentric Framework limits ad hoc design, discourages stove-pipe development, and reduces the development lifecycle of web services.  It also adds a metrics logging capability to provide feedback on the value of web services and identify future enhancements of the capability.  In May 2011, the Netcentric Framework was transitioned to the Defense Medical Logistic Standard Support Wholesale (DMLSS-W) team.  \n\nDefense Medical Logistics Transformation (DMLT) \u2013 Developed enterprise architecture (EA) products to support the business process reengineering project on Medical Equipment Life Cycle Management.   Project deliverables included (To-Be) process models, opportunities for improvement, and a Functional Capabilities Document.

New project starts will be defined and initiated in the T\/Q interest of areas of modern technical data, supply chain risk and incorporation of green considerations in procurements by joint planning with the T\/Q process owner, and activities initiated as appropriate. All of the three projects completing in FY2012 will transition in FY2012.\n\nProcurement Process Improvement:  The Decision Support Pilot project to evaluate the capabilities of a number of commercially available tools to detect fraudulent practices early \u2013 before award if possible \u2013 and define requirements for a DLA-wide decision support capability will be continued through the year. Efforts will be made to work with J7 procurement policy personnel to identify additional projects for initiation in FY2012 and FY2013.  No projects will complete in FY2012."

Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  \n\nExtension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA\u2019s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.

Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access\/aerial denial, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control (C2), planning, and decision support tools impede timely warfighter logistical support.

Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro\/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct \"what -if\" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset\u2019s course, speed or departure\/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery\/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.

                            "val": "The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) provides a vital service as the joint Department of Defense (DoD) Center for microelectronics acquisition, adaptive operations and support - advancing future microelectronics research, development, technologies and applications to achieve the Department\u2019s strategic and national security objectives.  An important part of the DMEA mission is to research current and emerging microelectronics issues with a focus on warfighters\u2019 needs.  To this end, DMEA is integrally involved in the development of capabilities and resultant products based on technologies whose feasibility has been demonstrated but which have yet to be applied to real-world and military applications.\n\nDMEA resolves microelectronics technology issues in weapon systems by quickly developing and executing appropriate solutions to not only keep a system operational but elevate it to the next level of sophistication or to meet new threats.  DMEA provides critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the DoD is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides critical, quick turn solutions for DoD, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market.  DMEA\u2019s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions\u2014along with its unique technical perspective\u2014allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele.  After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects.\n\nMicroelectronics technology is a vital and essential technology for all operations within the DoD.  DMEA operates the DoD\u2019s only microelectronic foundry\u2014a \u201cflexible foundry\u201d\u2014with a unique business model that incorporates industry partnership to serve the DoD where industry, alone, has not.  A microelectronic foundry is the factory that takes raw silicon and produces an integrated circuit or \u201cchip.\u201d  The fabrication of an integrated circuit consists of multiple processing steps to form and connect many transistors and other circuit components to form the desired function.  Each type of chip requires a different \u201crecipe\u201d (process) in the foundry.  Semiconductor companies spend great amounts of time and resources developing proprietary recipes.  They abandon these and develop new recipes as new generations of smaller and more powerful microelectronic components are needed. \n\nThe DMEA mission focuses on providing DoD systems with microelectronics components that are no longer provided by industry\u2014called \u201clegacy\u201d components.  Most domestic semiconductor foundries will discontinue low-volume, high-mix integrated circuits in as little as two years because, by then, there is little or no profit margin left; but the DoD requires an assured supply chain for its systems for 20 years or more.  Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the DoD.  DMEA\u2019s unique flexible foundry supports the DoD with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed.  To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.  These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for DoD needs.  These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry\u2019s first right of refusal.  DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components.  If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production.  A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners\u2019 valuable IP and processes.  DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner\u2019s IP is protected from potential competitors.  This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the DoD. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs.  As such, DMEA serves the DoD, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations."

This is a critical, time-sensitive requirement to support the DoD's strategy to provide an assured (always available) and trusted source of integrated circuits for critical weapon systems, sensors, and specialized electronic equipment.  The capability enhancement to DMEA\u2019s existing microelectronics foundry will cover a multitude of feature sizes down to 90nm and will be the only assured supply in the world to satisfy critical DOD and US Government program issues for the foreseeable future.\n\nMarket demand for more advanced technology drives the need to make microelectronics with more capabilities in smaller sizes.  The way this size is measured is called \u201cnode size\u201d.  In addition to utilizing various processes, industry constantly develops newer processes with ever smaller node sizes.  The pace of this progress follows what is known as \u201cMoore's Law\u201d: the transistor density of integrated circuits doubles every two years.\n\nMost domestic semiconductor foundries will discontinue low-volume, high-mix integrated circuits in as little as two years because there is little or no profit margin left.  90nm is a key node size for defense applications but industry forecasts show that the commercial industry will substantially decrease the production of 90nm chips by 2014, thereby making acquisition of this essential technology extremely difficult or impossible in the future.  To keep 90nm technology available, DMEA must immediately begin to extend its current capability to 90nm to allow sufficient time to buy equipment, get the processes in place, transfer IP, etc., and ensure the DoD\u2019s ability to use this technology by then.  This will also allow DMEA to purchase used equipment at extremely low prices from commercial sources that are closing or have already closed their 90nm process lines.  Without enhancing the existing foundry at DMEA to 90nm, in four years the DoD will be without a trusted and assured source for repeatable procurement of the state-of-the-practice integrated circuits that comprise a vast majority of the U.S. arsenal\u2019s microelectronics.  This, in turn, will severely impact real-world operations.  In the meantime, if a Trusted Supplier is available to make a requested component, DMEA will utilize that source of supply first.  This enhancement of DMEA capabilities is absolutely necessary to provide assured and secure microelectronics design and fabrication for trusted microelectronics systems and semiconductor components to ensure DOD technological superiority over potential adversaries.\n\nThe current DMEA foundry capability will accommodate node sizes down to 180nm.  Due to physical limitations in the current DMEA lithography and fabrication equipment, the state-of-the-practice processes down to 90nm that need to be incorporated require an expansion in equipment and facilities to handle the smaller node sizes as well as the larger silicon wafers.  This Project will fund expenses associated with planning and implementing the 90nm capability.  Initial costs will include design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities. Further, it will fund the outfitting of the selected property with the required force protection standards, infrastructure, tenant improvements, furniture, and equipment."

Under DODI 5200.39, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical\/essential systems need to be procured from trusted sources in order to avoid counterfeit, tampered, or sabotaged parts.  Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities (foundries) is making fabless semiconductor companies the norm in the U.S.  Sophisticated off-shore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies and engineering labor rates vastly less than engineering rates in the U.S. have resulted in outsourcing of electronics components and integrated circuits.  These trends threaten the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic on-shore suppliers and reducing access to trusted fabrication sources for advanced technology.  These trends are of acute concern to the defense and intelligence community.  Secure communications and cryptographic applications depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.\n\nThe Trusted Foundry program provides DoD and NSA with trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet the performance and delivery needs of their customers.  The program will also provide the Services with a competitive cadre of trusted suppliers that will meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for trusted integrated circuit components.  NSA, in their role as the Trusted Access Program Office, has successfully looked to commercial sources to satisfy their requirements.  Access to trusted suppliers is imperative to ongoing and future DoD\/NSA systems, and most centrally, Trusted Foundry access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs for state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies."

BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:\n- Establishing the authoritative source for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.\n- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.\n- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.\n- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).\nThe BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business:\n- Financial Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant financial statements and budgetary reports for DoD.\n- Cash Accountability Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant reports of the Department\u2019s cash position to the Treasury.\n- Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services: BEIS will provide data aggregation services, collecting select transaction level data from DoD systems of record\nto support business intelligence. BEIS will also deliver corporate business intelligence capabilities such as contingency reporting, status of funds reporting and\nmanagement dashboards.\n- Integration Support Services: This support will be funded by the requesting activity on a fee-for-service basis.\n- Reference Data Services: BEIS will establish a centralized repository for maintaining and exposing referential data to the DoD enterprise. This encompasses the\nSFIS Library data, Master Appropriation data, Corporate Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) data, and the Transportation Global Edit Table data.\n- General Ledger Services: BEIS will provide general ledger (i.e., financial management information) services for USSOCOM and select Defense Agencies.\nImpact: BEIS will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility to meet Enterprise Transition Plan milestones. It will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports. Through the BEIS enterprise business intelligence capability, DoD decision makers will gain improved visibility into the information they need to make strategic budget decisions. The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). Modernization efforts for the functionality identified for BEIS Family of Systems (FoS) Increment 1 was completed in FY10. However, there are further enhancements\/product improvements required to accomplish deployment\/implementation of BEIS Increment 1 capabilities in order to achieve Full Operating Capability (FOC), as well as additional modernization efforts associated with BEIS Increment II capability which require out-year funding."

DAI will transform the budget, finance, and accounting operations of the participating Defense Agencies to achieve accurate and reliable financial information for financial accountability and efficient decision making. The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that effectively addresses the requirements depicted in such tools as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a .mil environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 100,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions to support the warfighter.\n\nDAI will implement a compliant COTS business solution with common business processes and data standards for the following business functions:  procure to pay; order to cash; acquire to retire; budget to report; cost accounting; as well as time and labor.  Grants financial management, budget formulation, and re-sales accounting will be implemented by full Deployment. The Defense Agencies are committed to leveraging their resources and talents to build an integrated system that supports standardized processes and proves that the DoD is capable of using a single architecture and foundation to support multiple, diverse components.\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n- Common business processes and data standards;\n- Access to real-time financial data transactions;\n- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities;\n- Standardized line of accounting with the use of Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS); and\n- Use of USSGL Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\nThe system integration services for the DAI will include the following:\nProject management; Blueprinting; Design, Build, and Unit Test; Reports, Interfaces, Conversion, Extensions (RICE); Testing (integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); End-User Training\/Change Management; System Deployment; Conversion; Information Assurance; Sustainment; Data Service; Help Desk Support; Studies and Analysis Support; and Site Surveys."

The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD security mission into an Enterprise System that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. DISS is currently under development and will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), a legacy system. When fully deployed this will be a secure, authoritative source for the management, storage and timely dissemination of and access to personnel clearances with the flexibility to provide additional support structure for future DoD security process growth. When deployed, it will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DoD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies. DISS will provide improved support to the Insider Threat and Personal Identity programs and will be comprised of capabilities that are currently part of the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) and will create a robust and real-time capability for all DoD participants in the Military Departments, and DoD Agencies. It will also include automated records check (ARC) functionality and the creation of an adjudicative case management capability with e-Adjudication functionality. DISS will also provide the following operational capabilities - single point of entry for: personnel security, adjudicative case management, and decision support functionality to all DoD adjudicators. DISS will provide near continuous intra-Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) communications on a web-based enabled platform utilizing a unified architecture with security management.\n\nThe DISS program specifically addresses the requirements of Section 3001(e)  of PL 108-458, Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).  Additionally the DISS program supports the FY12 DoD Strategic Management Plan (SMP)'s Business Goal 6: \"Re-engineer \/ use end-to-end business processes to reduce transaction times, drive down costs, and improve service.\""

DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login\/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user\u2019s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document\u2019s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.\n\nDTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY11."

VIPS will enable a responsive, flexible and efficient means to qualify Applicants to meet manpower resource requirements for the uniformed Services, Coast Guard, and National Guard routine and contingency operations. VIPS will be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and will replace their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS). USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment. VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI). When fully implemented, VIPS will reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices. GAO has reported that better pre-screening practices will yield cost savings and cost avoidance of $83M per year for the VIPS automated elements, when Increment 2.0 is deployed.  The overall annual estimated cost avoidance is $479M across the DoD as referenced in the 1997 GAO Study 97-39 Military Attrition: DoD could save Millions by Better Screening Enlisted Personnel.  The implementation of a Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) approach will enable accession data to be securely available to applicants and ACOI partners such as Recruiting and Training Commands, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Military Health System, Human Resource Management (HRM), and Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO). VIPS will support compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) direction for a net-centric environment and take advantage of automated data capture technology, e.g., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results. The accessioning system of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free, and automated to assist with bringing the right people at the right time to operational commanders. The VIPS Program has not yet been baselined."

Requirements have been articulated to support the development of the core platform for VIPS as well as capabilities to fully assess a candidate into the military. The revised Increment 1.0 content provides sufficient capability to retire the legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS) through a series of capability deployments beginning in FY2014. Future increments will address the full VIPS capabilities necessary to realize the Return on Investment (ROI).\n\nOriginally the VIPS Increment 1.0 was procured under a single contract, competitively awarded to provide both a core infrastructure and business functions to support the accessions process. The VIPS PMO awarded a single Increment 1.0 contract on September 30, 2010 that will initially provide for the design of VIPS Increment 1.0 through PDR. The prime contractor also completed the design, development, and acceptance testing of the ROC prototype. Once the CCR report is completed, the program will seek a Milestone B decision. Following a successful Milestone B decision, the Government will assess appropriate contracting options to complete design, testing, deployment, fielding and training support. The system integration will include management of the technical configuration baseline and sustainment across VIPS. The VIPS PMO has adopted rigorous cost controls using earned value management and a comprehensive risk management program to manage program execution."

It is mandated for use by all DoD Services and\nAgencies for electronic invoicing by DFAR 252.232-7003. WAWF processes over 86 million transactions worth $301B per year and saves DoD millions of dollars\nannually in processing cost and avoided interest (over $77.6 M in FY10). WAWF brings together the invoice, the receiving report, and the contract from EDA to provide the accounting and entitlement systems with the three-way match needed to authorize payment. WAWF is also the Enterprise data entry point for the Item Unique Identifier (IUID) and Government Furnished Property (GFP) programs, the source of receipt and acceptance data for Service Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP), and is central for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) enterprise solutions for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Inter Governmental Transfer (IGT). The benefits to DoD are a single face to industry suppliers, global accessibility of documents, reduced need for re-keying, improved data accuracy, real-time processing, secure transactions with audit capability, and faster processing resulting in reduced interest penalties. For vendors, benefits include the capability to electronically submit invoices, reduction of lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contract payment records."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  \n\nWithin the current OUSD(C) environment, the Directorates have a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  This lack of standardization and integration limits the visibility of funding information, introduces manual efforts and undue complexities into the management of budget authority, and impedes the flow of funding documents.  This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."

Sales in subsistence continue to grow, largely due to requirements for overseas contingency operations.  The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR).  The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, and better ration variety.  CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations.  The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations."

Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are forgings. This program develops methods and technology to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA\u2019s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts:  Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die)."

Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying\/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices."

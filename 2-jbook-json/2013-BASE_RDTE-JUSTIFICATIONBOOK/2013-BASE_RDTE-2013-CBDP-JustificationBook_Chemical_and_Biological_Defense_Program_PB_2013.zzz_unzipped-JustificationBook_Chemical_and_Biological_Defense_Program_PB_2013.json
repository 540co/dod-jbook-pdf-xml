The objective of the basic research program is to advance fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences with an emphasis in exploring new and innovative research for combating or countering chemical, biological and radiological weapons.  Moreover, basic research supports a Joint Force concept of a lethal, integrated, supportable, highly mobile force with enhanced capability by the individual service member.  Specifically, the program promotes theoretical and experimental research and studies in the physical, life and information sciences.  A portion of this program element directly supports basic research efforts for the transformational medical technologies program.  The work in this program element is consistent with the Chemical Biological Defense Program Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) Plan.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities.  Basic research activities described in this budget justification leverage existing research programs and activities within the DoD and other government agencies and promotes cross-pollination between government and academia, as well as sponsors promising efforts of world class scientists.  The projects in this PE are placed in BA1, because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  \n\nThe Projects within this BA change in FY12 to reflect the research areas of Information Sciences (IS1), Life Sciences (LF1), and Physical Sciences (PS1), but Medical Biological Defense (TB1) is retained.  The projects of CB1 (Chemical\/Biological Defense), TC1 (Medical Chemical Defense), and TR1 (Medical Radiological Defense), will not be used after FY11.  The TB1 (Medical Biological Defense) project will not be used after FY12, with efforts moving into Project LF1 (Life Sciences)."

The objective of the Basic Research program is to successfully support the advancement of fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences with an emphasis on exploring new and innovative research for Chemical and Biological (CB) Defense.  It includes new study areas, such as: nanoscale sciences; chemical, biological, and bio-inspired sciences; surface and signature sciences (with an emphasis on Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs); and information sciences.  The aim is to promote innovative concepts and directions of research, which could lead to transformational capabilities to enhance the performance and ensure the safety of the Warfighter.  Research in nanoscale sciences (nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, and nanometer imaging) may bring about improvements in protection, decontamination and other core CB defense fields.  Research in chemical, biological, and bio-inspired sciences includes research in concepts such as synthetic biology, biomimetics, and other emerging areas of science to build a foundation for developing novel smart materials.  This will combine multiple functionalities into a common autonomous unit or network.  Surface and signature sciences focuses on the study of physical and chemical properties, especially with regard to NTAs, that seek to improve physical capabilities such as detection and decontamination.  Informational Sciences includes research in understanding cognitive and physiological effects on human decision-making, behavior and performance, and modeling and simulation of CB threats.  Breakthroughs and advances in functional capabilities gained from these scientific disciplines could impact the entire chemical and biological defense science and technology program.  Basic research activities described in this budget advance fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences.  These efforts may be transitioned to applied research or advanced technology development initiatives.  Due to the exploratory, academic, and theoretical nature of basic research efforts, projects described in this justification typically have a duration period, from conception to completion, of three to five years.  Promising basic research efforts will be further exploited for their application to chemical and biological defense in Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) or Budget Activity 3 (Advanced Technology Demonstrations).  The basic research efforts promote cross-pollination between government and academia, as well as sponsorship of promising efforts of world class scientists while promoting the development of young researchers.\nIn FY12, all Project CB1 research will be realigned to Project LF1 - Life Sciences (Basic Research), PS1 - Physical Sciences (Basic Research), and IS1 - Information Systems (Basic Research)."

Research results in physics, chemistry and materials sciences have potential application in point and standoff detection, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nanomechanical resonance sensing, and nanometer imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics."

This project supports core science efforts that may be applied to biological defense capability areas, such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.   \n\nThis project includes basic research to support Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) efforts.  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally bioengineered biological threats.  Research efforts evaluate the molecular characteristics of the interaction between host and pathogen, characterize the host's response to infection\/intoxication and identify common mechanisms and\/or pathways. The research also studies the correlates of immunity (common response against different pathogens), and looks for pre-symptomatic bio-markers.\n\nIn FY12, all Project TB1 research (other than Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) efforts are realigned to Project LF1 - Life Sciences (Basic Research).

The medical program focuses on the development of antidotes, drug treatments, disease surveillance and point-of-need diagnostic devices, patient decontamination and medical technologies management.  The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to provide the capability for the advancement of regulatory science and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM to address CBR threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  In the physical sciences area, the emphasis is on continuing improvements in CB defense materiel, including contamination avoidance, decontamination, and protection technologies.  Research efforts are planned to be initiated for CB defense technologies that will result from a strategic approach of converging nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science.  This PE also provides for applied research in the areas of real-time sensing and immediate biological countermeasures.\nEfforts under this PE transition to or provide risk reduction for Advanced Technology Development (PE: 0603384BP), Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (PE: 0603884BP) and System Development and Demonstration (PE: 0604384BP).\nIn FY13, all NTA efforts (both Medical and Non-Medical) within the PE are re-aligned to Project NT2 - Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense.  Also in FY13, all Medical efforts currently included in Project TB2 (Medical Biological Defense), Project TC2 (Medical Chemical Defense) and Project TR2 (Medical Radiological Defense), will be re-aligned to Project TM2 (Techbase Med Defense)."

Innovative biotechnology approaches will be incorporated to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents.  Categories for this project include core science efforts in biological defense capability areas, such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.  Medical Science and Technology (S&T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to biological agents.  \n\nThis project includes the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI), (funded as the Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) program in FY12).  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally engineered biological threats.  TMT's mission is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered biological threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  This mission is accomplished through two main efforts: 1) developing broad spectrum (multi-agent) therapeutics against biological agents (e.g. one drug that treats multiple agents); and 2) developing platform technologies to assist in the rapid development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in response to biological agents (e.g. developing new and innovative ways to mass produce drugs in the event of a biological incident). \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, based on partnerships between the government and industry, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the warfighter and national security needs.  Specifically, the MCMI will provide the capability for the advanced development and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM (to include TMT developed MCMs) to address CBRN threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  MCMI efforts within S&T are concentrated in two areas: 1) advancement of regulatory science, and 2) advancements in flexible manufacturing technologies for MCMs.\n\nIn FY13, all Project TB2 research is re-aligned into Project TM2 - Techbase Medical Defense."

The research and development of medical countermeasures for radiation exposure will ultimately enhance the survivability of Warfighters and will serve to significantly minimize the development of acute radiation syndromes and subsequent health problems.  Results of efforts funded under this project are collaboratively shared with other government agencies, while the Department of Defense maintains an emphasis on the development of pretreatments to protect military personnel who could be involved in responding to a radiological incident.  In FY13, all research in this area is re-aligned into Techbase Medical Defense (TM2)."

This program element (PE) funds advanced technology development for Joint Service and Service-specific requirements in both medical and physical sciences CBR defense areas.  The medical program aims to produce drugs, vaccines and medical devices as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.  In the physical sciences area, the focus is on demonstrations of CB defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, protection, and decontamination.  This PE also provides for the conduct of advanced technology development in the areas of real-time sensing, accelerated biological warfare operational awareness, and the restoration of operations following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.  This program is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, test of system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE transitions to and provides risk reduction for System Integration\/Demonstration (PE 0603884BP\/PE 0604384BP) activities.\nIn FY13, all NTA-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is re-aligned to Project NT3 - Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense (ATD).  Also all non-NTA Medical Biological and Medical Chemical Defense efforts (Projects TB3 and TC3) are re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD)."

Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  Categories of this project include biological defense capability areas such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.  Pretreatment efforts conduct research and development (R&D) of promising vaccines, medications, and technologies provided prior to potential exposure to biological agents.  The goal is to reduce or to entirely prevent adverse effects of exposure.  Diagnostic efforts are aimed at screening procedures and analytical methods to verify exposure and determine the effects of exposure to biological warfare (BW) or other biothreat agents.  Therapeutic efforts provide medical solutions to sustain and protect the Warfighter in biological environments.  Specifically, therapeutic efforts are aimed at developing medical countermeasures to treat exposure to biological or emerging threats such as bacterial (plague, anthrax, glanders), viral (smallpox, encephalitic alphaviruses), and toxin (ricin, botulinum neurotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin) agents. \n\nThis project includes the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI).  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally engineered biological threats.  TMT's mission is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered or emerging infectious disease biological threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  This mission is accomplished through two main efforts: 1) developing broad spectrum (multi-agent) therapeutics against BW or emerging infectious disease agents (e.g. one drug that treats multiple agents); and 2) developing platform technologies to assist in the rapid development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in response to BW or emerging infectious disease agents (e.g. developing new and innovative ways to mass produce drugs in the event of a biological incident).  Effective FY12 this effort is funded as the Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) Program. \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, based on public-private partnership agreements between the government and industry, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the warfighter and national security needs.  Specifically, the MCMI will provide the capability for the advanced development and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM (to include TMT developed MCMs) to address CBRN threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  MCMI efforts within S&T are concentrated in three areas: 1) transition of novel platform\/expression systems for MCMs, 2) transition advancement of regulatory science, and 3) integration of novel platforms with MCM advanced development and manufacturing.\n\nIn FY13, all research in this Project (TB3) is re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD)."

Completed aerosol efficacy studies of DNA-based vaccines and chemically inactivated\/attenuated vaccines against the alphaviruses.  Optimized dosing regimens to ensure effectiveness when co-administering the alphavirus vaccine components.  Continued the development of animals models for alphaviruses (EEE and WEE), and filoviruses (Ebola Sudan, Ebola Zaire, Ebola Bundibugyo, and Marburg), to fulfill future FDA animal rule requirements necessary for vaccine licensure.  For Alphaviruses, determined the median lethal dose of VEE, EEE, and WEE in a distinct type of non-human primate, and tested the alphavirus vaccines for immune stimulation capability and efficacy against challenge in this new animal model.  For filoviruses, determined the median lethal dose of Ebola Bundibugyo in a distinct type of non-human primate, and began natural history studies for Ebola Bundibugyo, Ebola Sudan, Ebola Zaire, and Marburg."

Entry of candidate pretreatment\/prophylaxes, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development (i.e., efforts funded in Budget Activities 4 and 5) is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) application and licensure processes, as well as Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition regulations.  Categories for this project include Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics to address Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA) and Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs) exposure.  \nIn FY13, all non-NTA research in this Project (TC3) is re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).

Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  This project also supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect the Warfighter against radiological\/nuclear exposure.\n\nThis project also includes efforts such as the Transformational Medical Technologies Program (TMT).  TMT's focus is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered or emerging infectious disease threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within S&T are concentrated in two areas: 1) advancement of regulatory science and 2) advancements in flexible manufacturing technologies for MCMs."

Specifically, innovative technical approaches will be used to develop, refine, and transition promising products to advanced development efforts to mitigate health consequences resulting from Acute Radiation Exposure (ARS) and Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure (DEARE).  Promising products and pertinent science and technology data will be used to support Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure processes, with an emphasis on the development of pretreatments to protect military responders in the event of a radiological incident.  Research efforts and data are collaboratively shared with other government agencies so that more mature and promising product candidates will be quickly transitioned to advanced development efforts.\nIn FY13, all research in this Project (TR3) is realigned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD)."

Within this project are two primary capability areas: 1) Experiment and Technology Demonstrations; and 2) Technology Readiness Assessment.  The Experiment and Technology Demonstrations capability area focuses on integration, testing, and assessing candidate ATDs and JCTDs and includes three thrust areas (two of which are new sub-thrust areas that consolidate legacy systems and are annotated as such below): Advanced Remediation Technologies (ART), Early Warning Military Application in Reconnaissance Systems (EW-MARS), and Comprehensive Innovative Protection (CIP).  The ART addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personnel, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination.  The EW-MARS achieves enhanced command and control decision making capabilities as a result of a combined and orchestrated family of chemical and biological defense systems deployed on various platforms in remote locations.  The CIP transitions mature technologies to improve individual and collective protection capabilities.  The Technology Readiness Assessment capability area focuses on completing manufacturing readiness assessments, technology readiness evaluations, and assessing maturity levels before transitioning ATDs and JCTDs to advanced development efforts located in Budget Activity 4 (Project TT4)."

This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  Projects within BA4 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and\/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  \n\nThe Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and\/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional \/ non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  \n\nThe Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  This Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process (\"One Portfolio\").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerate and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  \n\nACD&P also supports the Product Director Test Equipment, Strategy and Support (PD TESS) providing for the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk\/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  \n\nThe projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4."

Individual efforts are: (1) Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS); (2) Joint Biological Standoff Detector System (JBSDS); (3) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (4) Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD); (5) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Support; (6) Next Generation Chemical Point Detection (NGCPD); and (7) Next Generation Chemical Standoff Detection (NGCSD).\n\nThe CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) consists of portable, commercial and government off-the-shelf equipment to provide personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards and detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting of CBRN threats.  The system supports dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Site Assessment missions to enable more detailed CBRN information reports for commanders.\n\nThe Joint Biological Standoff Detection (JBSDS) mission is to provide near real-time detection of biological attacks\/incidents and standoff early detection\/warning (Detect to Warn) of BWAs at fixed sites or in static mode on vehicles.  This detect to warn capability will allow Commanders theater-wide initial early warning capability against BWA attacks.  JBSDS 1 was the first standoff early warning biological detection system for the Joint Services.  The system demonstrated the capability of providing standoff detection, ranging, tracking, discrimination (biological vs. non-biological), of BWA aerosol clouds for advanced warning, reporting and protection.  The current JBSDS 1 systems will be used for training to support JBSDS 2 concept of operations (CONOPs) development and can be deployed upon receipt of an urgent need statement. JBSDS Increment 2 will address the requirements beyond the JBSDS 1 interim system.  These key requirements are lower false alarm rate, day\/night discrimination sensitivity, and a reduction in overall system size, weight, and power.  \n\t\t\nThe Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) will integrate, test and produce the first lightweight (less than 37 lbs), low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive sample for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS will provide near real time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).  JBTDS components will be man portable, battery operable and easy to employ.  JBTDS will be used to provide notification of a hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning.  Units equipped with JBTDS will conduct biological surveillance missions to detect BWA aerosol clouds, collect a sample, and identify the agent to support time sensitive force protection decisions.\n\nThe Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) efforts will evaluate current technologies focusing on capability gaps for emerging threats by performing testing and evaluation of existing fielded systems to characterize and optimize their capability to detect emerging threats.\n\nThe Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Support program will integrate System of Systems (SoS) solutions across the Armed Services for MDAPs having Chemical and Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) survivability requirements.  The program will demonstrate modular, net-centric, \"plug and play\" capabilities for mounted and dismounted CBRN reconnaissance that will establish a common CBRN reconnaissance architecture across the services.  This program does not continue beyond FY11.\n\nThe Next Generation Chemical Point Detection (NGCPD), a new start program, will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCPD will provide improved CWA\/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  This sensor will improve passive defense\/detect capabilities, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction.\n\nThe Next Generation Chemical Standoff Detection (NGCSD), a next generation chemical standoff effort that was initiated under the JSLSCAD program, will provide a technical assessment of the state of current standoff detection capabilities for both traditional and non-traditional chemical agent attacks at fixed sites, forward operating bases and on Service designated vehicles and ships.  Evaluation of industry capabilities will support development of the future detection system.  This program does not continue beyond FY11."

Upon further review of the CBRN capabilities at the Materiel Development Decision (MDD), the program restructured in 4QFY10 to begin the acquisition process at Milestone (MS) B.  Funding finalized the Analysis of Materiel Solutions (AMS), materiel\/prototype testing, and design to provide the Services with enhanced full spectrum CBRN detection capability to support strategic, operational, and tactical objectives at lower life cycle costs.  Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets, Kits, and Outfits (DR SKO) will enhance the Situational Awareness (SA) by providing a dismounted ability to detect chemical, biological and radiological hazards across the Range of Military Operations (ROMO) and employ contamination avoidance activities to prevent disruption to operations and organizations.\n\nThe Emerging Threat efforts develop, test, procure, and sustain dismounted reconnaissance and sensitive site analysis systems for urgent needs for Domestic Response Capability Systems and Advanced Threat Boxes.  Funding also informs the Materiel Development Decision and requirements development for the CBRN DRS.\n\nJBTDS\n\nThe Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) is an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) program dedicated to developing a lightweight biological warfare agent system that will detect, warn, and provide presumptive identification and samples for follow-on confirmatory analysis.  The JBTDS is being developed using an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The JBTDS program will incrementally design, develop, integrate, test, procure and field systems that improve biological detection, sampling and identification capabilities and reduce size, weight, power consumption and logistics footprint over current systems.  JBTDS will make maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.  The awards for competitive prototyping utilized best value approach via the competitive CBRNE mission support contract to three contractor teams.  Full and open competition will be utilized at MS B for the EMD contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  In addition the JPM-BD is coordinating with JPM Guardian and JPM CBMS on the Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System programs respectively to share information and leverage potential identification technology solutions common to the three programs.\n\nThis approach also provides capability to the warfighter in the shortest possible time.  The JBTDS program will incrementally design, develop, integrate, test, procure and field systems that improve biological aerosol detection, sampling and identification capabilities and reduce size, weight, power consumption, and logistic footprint over current systems.  Again, COTS and GOTS will be utilized to the fullest extent possible.\n\nJCAD\n\nThe current strategy employs an improvement of the M4 JCAD to reduce Life Cycle costs, transition to a competitive procurement contract, and attain objective capability.  Three competitive fixed-price contracts for the M4A1 were awarded in Sep 2007 for prototypes and options for full rate production.  Competitive prototype testing was conducted and one system was selected for continued development.  The VBSS JCAD exercised a contract option for VBSS-specific software.  Upon completion of PVT and an Operational Assessment (under CBRN DRS), standard M4A1 JCADs will be reprogrammed to fill CBRN DRS VBSS needs.  The low volatile sensor technology evaluation will purchase prototypes of commercial equipment to evaluate technologies for addressing capability gaps for emerging threats not addressed by M4 and M4A1 JCAD.  The results of the low volatile sensor technology evaluation will be used to inform the Analysis of Alternatives for NGCPD.\n\nNGCPD\n\nThe next generation chemical point detection (NGCPD) program will target capability gaps for emerging threats not addressed by JCAD M4 and M4A1.  The analysis of alternatives will be used to generate performance specifications that will support contracting for competitive prototype development.  The goal for the initial stage of development will be to award three contracts for each variant of the NGCPD and down select to one contractor per variant by Milestone B."

Contamination mitigation systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.\n\nThis funding supports the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) in FY13.\n\nThe Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&T) research developments to existing Decontamination or Contamination Mitigation Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) Programs of Record and guides S&T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  Leveraging the outcome of the Materiel Development Decision (3QFY11) directed Analysis of Alternatives, DFoS will develop a Family of Systems, to include equipment, to improve decontamination processes, and decontaminant solutions to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating NTA and chemical and biological warfare agents from personnel, equipment, vehicle interiors\/exteriors, terrain, and fixed facilities.  DFoS has three initial efforts established to address some of the requirements of the Contamination Mitigation ICD: the Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW), the General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD) and the Contamination Indication\/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS) programs. \n\nThe JSEW effort will provide immediate\/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents\/contamination.  The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g\/m2 to less than or equal to 1 g\/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive equipment.\n\nThe GPD effort will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual\/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical and biological (CB) agents\/contamination.  In addition, the GPD program should also provide an immediate\/operational decontamination capability for aircraft exterior against chemical contamination.\n\nThe CIDAS effort will provide a contamination indication\/decontamination assurance technology and an applicator for use on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served and individual weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical contamination.\n\nAdditionally, the DFoS Program funds the Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP) effort in FY12 which will provide a capability to protect personnel handling and processing human remains contaminated with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear contamination.  CHRP transitions to its own funding line in FY13.\n\nThe Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) program will provide decontamination capabilities for interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities, aircraft and sensitive equipment inherent to the platform during air, ground and sea operations in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents\/contamination.  To accommodate the array of Service mission sets, the potential for varying system and\/or technology configurations may be required.  The JPID Preferred System Concept (PSC) may consist of multiple solution sets that provide increments of capability or one solution to address the various platforms and threats identified under the program.  No funding beyond FY12."

DFoS will support Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Programs of Record by guiding S&T efforts and transitioning mature technologies to meet program requirements.  The DFoS acquisition will leverage differing technologies in each subsystem to fulfill Warfighter capability gaps.  The JSEW, GPD, & CIDAS Programs will employ a CP effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of technologies (at a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4) that can meet the Contamination Mitigation ICD requirements.  A multi-phased Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be conducted to identify and evaluate the operational effectiveness of potential material solutions to satisfy Service requirements.  As each AoA phase is completed, individual systems and their respective phases of entry will be identified.  Industry and government labs will be solicited and through competitive prototyping, materiel solutions will be down-selected for continued development and fielding as a new or enhanced joint force capability.\n\nThe CHRP effort will leverage Commercial-off-the shelf (COTS)\/Non-developmental Item (NDI) technologies that will lead to a fielded capability to fulfill gaps as described in the ICD."

It addresses a current and significant capability gap to the operating force.  The effort is supported by the Capabilities Production Document for the JSGPM, which outlines the need for a robust TIC\/TIM protection capability.  It is expected that new capabilities demonstrated through the activities in this project will be leveraged and integrated into future increments of UIPE.  This Project also supports the Lightweight Chemical Biological Ensemble (LCBE) (renamed the Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE)), aimed at improving current protection levels while reducing physiological and logistical burdens.  The goal is to provide equipment that allows the individual soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Chemical and Biological (CB) environment with no or minimal degradation to his\/her performance."

This will be accomplished by: 1) Class-Based Analysis, 2) Filtration Advanced Screening Test (FAST), Desorption Study; and Advanced CBRN Filtration efforts.  Accomplishments to date include development of the prioritization approach and class based analysis; development of challenge levels for performance curve through modeling; FAST of ASZM-TDA, BSC, and EUMC against the priority TIC LIST; test of representative chemicals demonstrating the applicability of the class based analysis, and Scientific literature review of filter desorption.\n\nLCBE\n\nThe LCBE program has been renamed as the Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) program.\n\nStrategy based on incremental development in accordance with prescribed Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Defense Joint Requirements Office (CBRND-JRO) approved capabilities documents.  The objective of the UIPE is to fully integrate chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) and toxic industrial material (TIM) protection into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask - helmet integration, protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.\n\nUIPE is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  UIPE will pursue a Modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Item (COTS\/NDI) Acquisition Strategy; full and open competition will be used.  During the Technology Development (TD) phase UIPE will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), conduct competitive prototyping, and down-select industry candidates demonstrating the greatest ability to meet UIPE requirements.  Following Milestone (MS) B approval contracts will be awarded and integrated Developmental Test\/Operational Test (DT\/OT) will be initiated on selected candidate system(s).  UIPE is supported by an Initial Capability Document (ICD), a Capability Development Document (CDD), and a MS A.  UIPE will ultimately provide CB protective equipment with improved operational capability to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Special Operations Command.\n\nFuture increments of UIPE shall be defined via separate capabilities documents.  Each successive increment will follow a similar path\/process from MS A or MS B through MS C and will leverage preceding efforts to the greatest extent possible, maintaining commonality and synergy across all increments."

Specifically it supports the Joint Effects Model (JEM) Program and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) Program.\n\nThe Joint Effects Model (JEM) is DoD's only accredited model for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment.  JEM is a software-only, ACAT III program that is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and\/or incidents; high altitude releases, incident source prediction to include NTA events, urban CBRN\/Toxic Industrial Hazard environments, human inhalation, contagious\/infectious disease, population movements, efficacy of medical countermeasures, industrial transport; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.\n\nThe Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) will provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Integrated Early Warning, Analysis and Response capability to minimize the effects of hostile CBRN attacks, as well as accidents and incidents.  It will provide the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate warnings.  JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Service C4ISR Systems.  JWARN will transition from platform specific Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  JWARN will also provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional C2 systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing and future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will provide additional data processing to support the production of plans and reports, and access to specific CBRN information to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  The JWARN capability described above will be developed utilizing an incremental approach based on Service requirements and host system architecture."

JEM is now being fielded in increments of capabilities.  Each increment will retain the functionality of the preceding increment.  The JEM development effort will be aligned with the evolving Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) architectures and technologies, as well as, with Service Command and Control (C2) systems.  JEM will develop three distinct increments of software.  JEM is a web-services based application and has been granted an Interoperability Certificate by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC).  The program plans to award competitive contracts using fixed price or cost-plus as appropriate.\n\nJWARN\n\nJWARN will develop and provide Integrated Early Warning capabilities to specified (Common Operating Environment (COE-based)) operational-level Service Command and Control (C2) systems at the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) level, extend the integration effort into the Service tactical (non COE-based) C2 systems, provide connectivity to legacy and newly developed sensors, and complete the development of JWARN. \n\nJWARN will extend these baseline capabilities to emerging, net-centric, Service C2 systems and Service CBRN sensors and detectors as they are developed and fielded.  JWARN will also ensure CBRN warning and reporting capabilities remain synchronized with the changing demands of the Warfighter while keeping pace with evolving C2 systems and their architectures, and will further evolve by integrating next generation sensors, detectors and emerging Medical and Biological Surveillance requirements into the CBRN Enterprise."

The ADM will provide an integrated infrastructure to support a medical countermeasures pipeline, and respond to Warfighter and National security needs.  The ADM effort is being executed in two phases.  Phase I is a two year base period to establish, commission, and validate facilities and equipment for two ADM suites using single use, disposable, modular and multi-product technologies for medical countermeasures advanced development and manufacturing.  Both suites must meet Biological Safety Level-3 (BSL-3) standards.  Phase 2 consist of four (4) two-year options to support and maintain ADM capability in a state of readiness to support medical countermeasures development (under the animal rule as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use.  Once commissioned, the ADM will support transition of enabling science and technology (S&T) and novel platform and expression systems for delivery of products by leveraging technological and regulatory science advancements.\n\nThe Next Generation Diagnostic System addresses the mission needs identified in the CBRN Field Analytics ICD (2010).  The mission of the Next Generation Diagnostic System is to provide chemical, biological, and radiological diagnostic systems.  NGDS Increment 1 materiel solutions will significantly improve analytical and diagnostic capabilities across the continuum of biological warfare threat agents and operations (peacetime, wartime, and deployed).  NGDS Increment 1 medical diagnostic capabilities will provide health care providers with more timely and accurate information to inform individual patient treatment.  NGDS Increment 1 clinical analytical and interconnectivity capabilities will provide commanders with situational awareness of biological warfare hazards to support Force Protection and Force Health Protection decision making.  \n\nThe (1) Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) Therapeutic Medical Countermeasures (MCM), which will provide broad spectrum (multi-agent), platform-based therapeutics against Ebola and Marburg viruses.  TMT efforts to be conducted for the medical countermeasures during this period include Phase 1 human clinical safety trials, non-clinical studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy, and animal model development \/ refinement.  DoD anticipates the FDA will require use of the Animal Rule for the HFV therapeutic medical countermeasures, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible. ; (2) Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) MCM Increment  1, Many conditions result in the inability to provide effective vaccines to service members and civilians.  Effective vaccines do not exist for all known strains of influenza virus.  The emergence of a new pandemic strain with no existing effective vaccine or therapeutic is highly likely.  EID-Flu will provide a broad spectrum EID MCM to protect service members from naturally occurring, biologically or genetically engineered Influenza viruses. EID Flu, a rapidly adaptable, broad spectrum therapeutic (3) CBRN Biosurveillance (BSV), a new start program, will initiate systems development, engineering, logistics planning, and test planning for integration of existing commercial and developmental next generation systems and clinical and non-clinical sample collection and analysis tools to provide pre\/post event real-time alarm and near-real time confirmation of CBRN threats, to enhance battlespace awareness, and provide high-quality biosurveillance data.\n\nThe Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP), under Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) Joint Program Management Office, funds the technology development phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these BW agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  JVAP has three product lines in the early development phase: Filovirus vaccine, Ricin vaccine, and Western\/Eastern\/ Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis vaccine (WEVEE).  JVAP initiated the Filovirus Vaccine program in FY10.  The Ricin and WEVEE vaccine programs will be initiated in early FY13.  Efforts to be conducted during this period include develop pilot scale manufacturing processes to support nonclinical and clinical studies; development vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct non-clinical studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy; submit Investigational New Drug (IND) application; and conduct Phase 1 clinical human safety studies.  JVAP anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  JVAP also has the mission to maintain IND vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines are used to possibly provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases.  The Department of Defense is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Filovirus, Ricin, and WEVEE vaccines."

A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid\/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  The program currently funds: (1) Bioscavenger, a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents; (2) Centrally Acting Nerve Agent Treatment System (CANATS), an adjunct that augments the current capability, will treat adverse effects of nerve agent intoxication occurring in the central nervous system and will provide improved survival, reduced morbidity, and decreased neurological damage; and (3) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS), a replacement and improvement to existing capability, to be used as a treatment for nerve agent intoxication; the INATS effort also includes expanding the indications for Pyridostigmine Bromide (PB) that will be integrated with current therapeutic regimens.  The INATS program efforts do not continue beyond FY12.  CANATS advanced development efforts have been delayed beyond FY13."

Initially, the Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Management Office (JPMO) exercised management oversight and a commercial partner as the system integrator during the Technology Development Phase to examine a human plasma-derived butyrylcholinesterase.  Activities included small scale manufacturing, conduct of pre-clinical animal safety studies, submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and completion of a Phase 1 human clinical safety study.  Subsequently, the MITS JPMO evaluated a goat-derived recombinant butyrylcholinesterase candidate and multiple small molecule candidates.  The small molecule candidates were not pursued beyond initial toxicology\/safety testing in animals.  For goat-derived Bioscavenger, activities included small scale manufacturing, conduct of pre-clinical animal safety studies, submission of an IND application, completion of a Phase 1 human clinical safety study and conduct of preliminary animal efficacy studies.  The goat-derived Bioscavenger candidate was discontinued after the product failed to demonstrate sufficient product performance in the preliminary animal efficacy studies.  During FY11, the program completed a system engineering trade off analysis resulting in a reduction of the initial operating capability\/full operational capability (IOC\/FOC) quantities and consequently an estimated cost avoidance of $1.14B over the product life.\n\nThe path forward will include a formal Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  Concurrently the MITS JPMO will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies and investigate additional product indications.  Subsequently, an expanded force solution prophylaxis will be pursued, once appropriate technologies have matured.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), the MITS JPMO will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  The RFP for product manufacturing will include options for transition to the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and delivery system and will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval.  The EMD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the MITS JPMO, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production and conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing surveillance studies.\n\nCANATS\n\nThe Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Management Office (JPMO) will serve as the system integrator during the Technology Development Phase and will conduct non-clinical animal studies and Phase 1 human clinical safety studies with the centrally acting drug candidate(s) that will serve as adjunct therapy to the already available nerve agent treatment regimen.  If multiple centrally acting candidates are transitioned from tech base, the MITS JPMO will down-select and determine the final configuration of the CANATS autoinjector prior to Milestone B.  After Milestone B, during the Engineering and Manufacturing (EMD) Phase, the MITS JPMO and\/or a commercial partner (product dependent) will serve as the system integrator to conduct Phase 2 human clinical safety, definitive animal efficacy and toxicology studies required for FDA approval.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and autoinjector delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will seek FDA approval for the CANATS product during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, and full rate and stockpile production will be pursued.  Any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies will be conducted during the Production and Deployment Phase.\n\nINATS\n\nThe Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Management Office (JPMO) will serve as the system integrator during the Technology Development Phase and conduct formulation development, pre-clinical animal studies and Phase 1 human clinical safety studies for the candidate oxime to replace 2-pralidoxime chloride in the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Autoinjector (ATNAA). The animal studies will be used to expand the indications for Pyridostigimine bromide (SNAPP\/PB) beyond Soman.  After Milestone B, during the Engineering and Manufacturing (EMD) Phase, the MITS JPMO and\/or a commercial partner (product dependent) will serve as the system integrator to conduct Phase 2 human clinical safety, definitive animal efficacy and toxicology studies required for FDA approval.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and autoinjector delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, and full rate and stockpile production will be pursued.  Any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies will be conducted during the Production and Deployment Phase."

There are no FDA-approved prophylactics, treatments, or biodosimetry capabilities against radiation exposure.  Treatment of R\/N casualties depends on effective use of multiple medical capabilities in an integrated manner.  Thus, this program supports the development of medical radiological countermeasures (MRADC) using a family-of-systems approach to provide a full spectrum capability to protect against the radiation threat which includes prophylactic, treatment, and biodosimetry capabilities.  Individual countermeasure solutions will be developed using a single step to a full capability (FDA approval) strategy.  Multiple contractors will serve as individual product integrators throughout development and will be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the FDA.  Each contractor will sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and\/or licenses.  The Technology Development phase includes pre-clinical studies, completion of manufacturing scale up, Phase 1 human clinical safety studies and initiation of manufacturing scale up activities, potentially utilizing the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  During the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies will be conducted.  FDA approval of the countermeasure is an exit criterion for the EMD phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be purchased.  Subsequent purchases will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Any post-marketing surveillance studies requested by the FDA will be conducted.\n\nMedical Radiological Countermeasures (MRADC) efforts include development of multiple countermeasures required to protect U.S. Forces against a myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation and to restore casualties to pre-exposure health.  MRADC shall reverse or limit radiation injury resulting in increased survival, decreased incapacity, and sustained operational effectiveness.  In addition, MRADC shall be effective against a broad range of radiation sources and types and shall be useable throughout the full spectrum of healthcare operations."

The DoD is working very closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which also has a radiation countermeasure program.  In support of the Integrated National Biodefense Portfolio, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was established between HHS and DoD to prevent duplication of efforts and create synergies in the development of MRADC.  In support of the MOU, the establishment of an interagency working group provides oversight and guidance to both agency programs and allows leveraging of knowledge and successes to advance the DoD MRADC program.  Under the MOU, MITS executes Interagency Agreements with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), HHS' advanced developer, to promote the science of MRADC.  \n\nThis project funds the advanced development of candidate therapeutic medical countermeasures to mitigate the consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation from nuclear or radiological attacks.  There are currently no FDA-approved products to treat Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  Exposure to ionizing radiation causes ARS which includes damage to blood-forming cells (hematopoietic system), gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system.  Medical countermeasures must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use prior to fielding.  Testing the efficacy of candidate drugs against lethal radiation exposure cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, surrogate animal models must be used to obtain FDA approval.  \n\nMedical Radiological Countermeasures (MRADC) efforts include development of multiple countermeasures required to protect U.S. Forces against a myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation and to restore casualties to pre-exposure health.  MRADC shall reverse or limit radiation injury resulting in increased survival, decreased incapacity, and sustained operational effectiveness.  In addition, MRADC shall be effective against a broad range of radiation sources and types and shall be useable throughout the full spectrum of healthcare operations."

These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies from laboratory experiments to acquisition programs through risk reduction, engineering and integration.  These Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and\/or cost effectiveness.  Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated.  Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can either be left in place for extended user evaluations, accepted into advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.  This project funds four major thrust areas (one of which is a new thrust areas to address DoD emphasis on an interagency collaboration for biological detection, surveillance, recovery and resilience and is annotated as such below): Hazard Mitigation, Early Warning, Comprehensive Innovative Protection (CIP) and Interagency Countering Bio-threats Initiative (ICBI).  The Hazard Mitigation thrust area addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personal, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination.  The Early Warning thrust area achieves enhanced command and control decision making capabilities as a result of a combined and orchestrated family of chemical and biological defense systems deployed on various platforms in remote locations.  The CIP transitions mature technologies to improve individual and collective protection capabilities for U.S. and coalition Warfighters.  The Interagency Countering Bio-threats Initiative is targeted to reduce biological threats by: (1) improving DoD access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establishing and reinforcing DoD concept of operations (CONOPS) against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) instituting a suite of coordinated DoD and interagency activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and\/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences.  The following is a description of specific efforts funded under each thrust area:   \n\nHazard Mitigation:\nHazard Mitigation Material and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) - A layered strategy to identify individual technologies that may be collectively applied to reduce or eliminate chemical and biological hazards.  It includes a Decontamination Family of Systems that gives the Warfighter multiple capabilities to reduce or eliminate chemical hazards.  This effort leverages upon and consolidates Auto Decon and SPIDER completed in FY10. \n\nEarly Warning:\nMilitary Applications in Reconnaissance Systems for Joint Force Protection (MARS-JFP) - A data fusion ATD that leverages early warning technologies developed in Budget Activity 3 (Project TT3) to improve the capability to detect and react to an initial chemical and biological attack, as well as prevent a second attack.  Specifically, this effort focuses on force protection decision making for external, cross domain sensors for cueing\/tipping, and managing resources of dynamically deployable high quality chemical and biological sensors.\n\nRapid Area Surveillance Reconnaissance (RASR) - A sensitive-site exploration, standoff reconnaissance, ATD that leverages early warning technologies developed in Budget Activity 3 (Project TT3) to survey large areas (whole rooms, courtyards, fields) and assess and identify contamination with Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs).  \n\nPost Intercept Weapons of Mass Destruction Identification (PIWID) - An ATD that leverages early warning technologies developed in Budget Activity 3 (Project TT3), which addresses both operational and technical issues associated with the capability to determine the presence of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) in the threat payload of ballistic or cruise missile delivery systems after a successful active defense intercept.\n\nComprehensive Innovative Protection (CIP):\nDemo-Low Burden Individual Protection Demonstration (IP Demo) - An ATD that leverages lightweight chemical and biological protective textiles developed in Budget Activity 3 (Project CB3, Protection and Hazard Mitigation), and will support the next generation Joint Chemical Ensemble.  This effort will provide significantly decreased thermal burden correlated with acceptable levels of chemical and biological protection, as well as significantly increase the ability of the Warfighter to accomplish a mission in a contaminated environment.  \n\nJoint Medical Distance Support and Evaluation (JMDSE) - A JCTD that seeks to develop new detect-to-treat CONOPS enabled by the deployment of new chemical and biological detection and identification capabilities to front line forces.\n\nInteragency Countering Bio-threats Initiative (ICBI):\nTransatlantic Collaborative Biological Resiliency Demonstration (TaCBRD) - A Department of Defense (DoD) managed effort in collaboration with Department of State and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  This collaborative effort that will provide a coordinated, systems approach to the response and recovery of a overseas partner nation with DoD assistance.  This will include Department of Defense (DoD) infrastructures and high traffic areas."

ATDs and JCTDs emphasize technology assessment and integration rather than technology development.  The goal is to provide a prototype capability to the Warfighter and to support in the evaluation of that capability.  The Warfighters evaluate the capabilities in real military exercises and at a scale sufficient to fully assess military utility.  When possible, the ATDs will leverage results from existing chemical and biological science and technology (S&T) efforts and prior ATDs.  Market research\/baselining is performed prior to ATD initiation to determine if a suitable solution exists or whether a solicitation\/sole source is required to develop a solution.  The ATDs are typically managed by DoD, Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDCs) or University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).  This is done through the Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) or the Interagency Cost Reimbursable Order (IACRO) in accordance with the Economy Act.  In addition, the ATDs utilize the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Broad Area Announcement process to fund promising technologies between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 and TRL 6.  The ATD manager, who is typically responsible for total system development, can subcontract industry, academia, or other government agencies to perform individual component development."

                            "val": "Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations\/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives, both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  \n\nContamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remove chemical detection for ground, aircraft, and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  \n\nThe DoD Biological Defense mission requires the detection of validated biological threat agents to provide early warning capabilities on mobile and fixed platforms.  This program, element will provide theater protection through the development of point and stand-off detection systems.  The detection system concept will provide detection, identification, warning, and sample collection for verification that a biological agent attack has occurred.  \n\nThe Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and\/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD, such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics, and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting SDD on these prophylactic, therapeutic and rapid identification and diagnostic CB medical countermeasures.  \n\nThe Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  This Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process (\"One Portfolio\").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerate and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  \n\nThe projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5."

                                            "val": "This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD\/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  \n\nEfforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS); (2) Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS); (3) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (4) Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD); (5) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Support; (6) Next Generation Chemical Standoff Detection (NGCSD); (7) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection Support; and (8) Sensor Suite Integration for NBC Reconnaissance Systems (SSI NBCRS).  \n\nThe CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) consists of portable, commercial and government off-the-shelf equipment to provide personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards and detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting of CBRN threats.  The system supports dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Site Assessment missions to enable more detailed CBRN information reports for commanders.  The program will support emerging CBRN threat capability to provide an enhanced capability in the future.  \n\nThe Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) is a Joint Service biological detection system.  The Army platforms include the JBPDS on the Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS) and the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV).  The Navy installs the JBPDS on Aegis class ships.  Engineering Changes to refresh the technology of the JBPDS consist of two separate efforts (one funded by procurement and one RDT&E funded) that, when combined, will reduce lifecycle costs and address obsolescence concerns.  The existing computer hardware and operating system in the JBPDS will not be supportable beyond FY13 due to obsolescence.  Under the existing production contract, an engineering effort is underway to address the computer and operating system obsolescence concerns.  The element being developed under RDT&E funding is a new detector technology that will reduce false positives by a rate of 30:1 resulting in reduced consumable use and reduced operational and maintenance costs.\n\nThe Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) will integrate, test and produce the first lightweight (less than 37 lbs), low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive sample for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS will provide near real time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).  JBTDS components will be man portable, battery operable and easy to employ.  JBTDS will be used organically at battalion level and below and provide notification of a hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning.  Units equipped with JBTDS will conduct biological surveillance missions to detect BWA aerosol clouds, collect a sample, and identify the agent to support time sensitive force protection decisions.\n\nThe Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) is a miniaturized, rugged, and portable point chemical agent detector that automatically and simultaneously detects, identifies, quantifies, and alerts in the presence of nerve, blister, and blood chemical warfare agents.  The M4 JCAD entered full rate production in September 2008 and will be produced through FY10.  The attainable JCAD Increment 2 capabilities within the JCAD Increment 1 objectives were incorporated into an improvement of the M4 JCAD (M4A1).  Production of the M4A1 began in FY11.  JCAD will be used for wheeled vehicles, stand alone, and individual soldier applications.  The M4 JCAD will replace the M8A1 and the M22 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarms (ACAA\/ACADA).  The M4A1 may additionally replace the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) and Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM) and other legacy systems currently used by the individual Services.\n\t\nThe Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Support program will integrate System of Systems (SoS) solutions across the Armed Services for (MDAP) having Chemical and Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) survivability requirements.  The program will demonstrate modular, net-centric, \"plug and play\" capabilities for mounted and dismounted CBRN reconnaissance that will establish a common CBRN reconnaissance architecture across the services.  This program does not continue beyond FY11.\n\nThe Next Generation Chemical Standoff Detection (NGCSD), a next generation chemical standoff effort initiated under the JSLSCAD program, will provide an assessment of current standoff detection capabilities for both traditional and non-traditional chemical agent attacks at fixed sites, forward operating bases and on Service designated vehicles and ships.  This effort will evaluate industry developed standoff sensor technologies for future standoff systems.  Findings will support development of the future detection system.  This program does not continue beyond FY11.\n\nThe Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection projects will develop, procure and sustain detection and identification system(s) through follow-on tech insertion that will enhance the Domestic Response Capability, Advanced Threat (AT) Box, CBRN DRS (Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets, Kits, and Outfits), and Next Generation Chemical Point Detection programs to attain situational awareness and respond to emerging and escalating threats.  The projects will test, optimize and sustain technology capabilities provided within the fielded NTA detection components and explore the passive defense mission space.  The products provide a mid-term capability to detect priority emerging threat materials and afford the Warfighter the ability to support domestic response and force protection missions.  These products leverage common core technologies to detect and identify threats that can be exploited for lab deployable, fixed site and handheld applications.  Conduct systems engineering analysis to prioritize capability gaps and outline issues that require investment.  These projects will continue to address next priority passive defense mission areas and escalating threats by continuing to qualify and improve key detection and identification equipment.\n\nSensor Suite Integration for NBC Reconnaissance Systems (SSI NBCRS) will evaluate technologies' ability to provide biological warfare agents (BWA), liquid Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA), Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC), and Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) identification using a single detection technology.  This effort will provide improved capability and significant cost savings to the warfighter by reducing consumables, reducing false alarms, and providing the ability to rapidly upgrade to detect emerging threats.  The program will demonstrate a modular, \"plug and play\" capability, which may support mounted and dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, fixed site, lab deployable, and handheld applications.  Feasibility of a single sensor concept for CWA, TIC, and biological aerosols was demonstrated in FY11 technology evaluation.  A low volatile chemical surface contamination detection capability will provide improved identification of CWAs, TICs, and NTAs.  Continued prototype development will mitigate risk for future programs including NTA Detection products and Next Generation Chemical Point Detection."

                                            "val": "CBRN DRS\n\nThe Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)\/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step to full capability acquisition approach.  Upon further review of the CBRN capabilities at the Materiel Development Decision (MDD), the program restructured in 4QFY10 to begin the acquisition process at Milestone (MS) B.  Funding finalized the Analysis of Materiel Solutions (AMS), materiel\/prototype testing, and design to provide the Services with enhanced full spectrum CBRN detection capability to support strategic, operational, and tactical objectives at lower life cycle costs.  Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets, Kits, and Outfits (DR SKO) will enhance the Situational Awareness (SA) by providing a dismounted ability to detect chemical, biological and radiological hazards across the Range of Military Operations (ROMO) and employ contamination avoidance activities to prevent disruption to operations and organizations.\n\nThe Emerging Threat efforts develop, test, procure, and sustain dismounted reconnaissance and sensitive site analysis systems for urgent needs for Domestic Response Capability Systems and Advanced Threat Boxes.  Funding also informs the Materiel Development Decision and requirements development for the CBRN DRS.\n\nJBPDS\n\nEngineering changes to refresh the technology of the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) consist of two separate efforts that, when combined, will reduce life cycle costs and address obsolescence concerns.  The technology update for the detector focused on the Rapid Agent Aerosol Detector (RAAD) which is being developed by MIT-LL with producibility and logistics support from Kansas City Plant (KCP).  JPM-BD will competitively solicit for RAAD full rate production.  KCP will transition RAAD production to industry with the use of a technical data package in FY15.  The RAAD contractor will provide the new biological warfare agent detector to the JBPDS prime contractor, who was selected in 2010 through a two step competitive process.  Through an Engineering Change Order the prime contractor will initiate system integration efforts to accept the new detector technology.  A Follow-on Test and Evaluation will be conducted to ensure the new components meet the JBPDS System Production Capabilities Document requirements.\n\nJBTDS\n\nThe Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) is an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) program dedicated to developing a lightweight biological warfare agent system that will detect, warn, and provide presumptive identification and samples for follow-on confirmatory analysis.  The JBTDS is being developed using an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  The JBTDS program will incrementally design, develop, integrate, test, procure and field systems that improve biological detection, sampling and identification capabilities and reduce size, weight, power consumption and logistics footprint over current systems.  JBTDS will make maximum use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.  The awards for competitive prototyping utilized best value approach via the competitive CBRNE mission support contract to three contractor teams.  Full and open competition will be utilized at MS B for the EMD contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  In addition the JPM-BD is coordinating with JPM Guardian and JPM CBMS on the Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System programs respectively to share information and leverage potential identification technology solutions common to the three programs.\n\nThis approach also provides capability to the warfighter in the shortest possible time.  The JBTDS program will incrementally design, develop, integrate, test, procure and field systems that improve biological aerosol detection, sampling and identification capabilities and reduce size, weight, power consumption, and logistic footprint over current systems.  Again, COTS and GOTS will be utilized to the fullest extent possible.\n\nJCAD\n\nThe current strategy employs an improvement of the M4 JCAD to reduce Life Cycle costs, transition to a competitive procurement contract, and attain objective capability.  Three competitive fixed-price contracts for the M4A1 were awarded in Sep 2007 for prototypes and options for full rate production.  Competitive prototype testing was conducted and one system was selected for continued development.  The VBSS JCAD exercised a contract option for VBSS-specific software.  Upon completion of PVT and an Operational Assessment (under CBRN DRS), standard M4A1 JCADs will be reprogrammed to fill CBRN DRS VBSS needs.  The low volatile sensor technology evaluation will purchase prototypes of commercial equipment to evaluate technologies for addressing capability gaps for emerging threats not addressed by M4 and M4A1 JCAD.  The results of the low volatile sensor technology evaluation will be used to inform the Analysis of Alternatives for NGCPD.\n\nNTA DETECT\n\nThe Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection products will provide a detection capability through incremental acquisition that will afford the Warfighter ability to attain situational awareness and respond to unknown and emerging hazards.  The products provide a near term capability to detect priority emerging threat materials with common core technologies to detect and identify threats that can further be explored for lab deployable, fixed site and handheld applications.  Leveraging COTS\/GOTS assessments will be used in order to lower program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a higher confidence in selected technologies.  The project will continue to address next priority mission areas and threats by continuing to qualify identified detection equipment.  To accomplish these efforts, various competitive contracting strategies will be used, i.e., cost plus type contracts, task orders, and IDIQ.\n\nSSI NBCRS\n\nThe Sensor Suite and Integration for Nuclear Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance System (SSI NBCRS) will evaluate the state of Chemical and Biological sensor manufacturing to support future acquisition programs.  In FY11 a technical evaluation was performed on four separate Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) task orders using a competitive omnibus contract.  The evaluation focused on using a common sensor technology to detect and identify both chemical and biological threats.  Future efforts will modularize the components allowing for potential mounted and dismounted reconnaissance, lab deployable, fixed site, and handheld applications.  A similar technical evaluation in FY11-FY12 will assess ability of industry sensors to detect low volatility CWAs, TICs, NTAs and other compounds of interest.  This effort will allow the program office to assess current technologies in order to lower program risk, reduce costs, and ensure a higher confidence in selected technologies for the Next Generation Chemical Point Detection (NGCPD) and NTA Detect programs."

Particular emphasis is placed on improving military-civilian interoperability in CBRN detection and response capabilities; providing tiered levels of CBRN protection and response capabilities to military installations; and tailored modular and integrated COTS solutions to consequence management units.   \n\nEfforts included in this project are:\n\nThe Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS) will be modular, scalable and adaptable to a variety of concept of operations (CONOPS) and environmental conditions.  Currently, fielded systems have been designed independently by various agencies with the intent of meeting a specific units requirements.  As a result, multiple mobile lab configurations exist with differing sustainment tails and lacking in commonality.  The system under development will incorporate an open architecture that can accommodate quick installation or removal of equipment as mission requirements dictate.  As well, it will provide the ability to rapidly develop a common operating picture allowing first responders and DoD officials to determine the appropriate course of action.  The analytical detection package fielded will be fitted to the specific mission and CONOPS of the gaining unit and be able to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs), Lower Explosive Limits (LEL), and radioactive particles in all sample types. \n\nThe Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team Program supports the ongoing assessment and acquisition of COTS and GOTS analytical detection, protection, decontamination and sampling equipment for survey in order to expand\/enhance the operational capabilities of the (57) WMD CST Teams."

CALS will address situational awareness by leveraging efforts underway with Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) to the extent possible.  CALS will accommodate these component requirements within a modular and scalable concept framework.\n\nWMD CST\n\nThis program utilizes multiple acquisition vehicles to deliver a CBRN capability to the WMD response units.  The CALS program will upgrade the analytical capability with the objective of improving chemical and biological detection sensitivity and selectivity of the WMD CST Analytical Laboratory System Increment 1 and the 20th SUPCOM heavy and light tactical lab variants.  Additionally, the CALS will integrate the communications and reachback capability for mobile CBRN homeland defense capability as required by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)."

CP systems can be installed on any type of platform, such as, hard and soft shelters, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and buildings.  CP systems provide spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.\n\nThe system included in this project is the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP).\n\nJECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems is planned that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination."

During the Pre-MS A Concept Refinement Phase, conducted a tailored Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) leveraging the market survey, test results and lessons learned from the FY05 ColPro Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE).  During the Technology Development Phase following MS A, technology demonstrations were conducted to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that individually or together meet the Warfighters needs.  Following MS B, a Statement of Work (SOW) and System Performance Specification (SPS) were used to award competitive cost plus incentive fee contract to build prototypes that are being subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase.  Following MS C, award a Fixed Price Incentive Successive Target (FPIS) option for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test & Evaluation (MOT&E).  Following a successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision, award a FPIS option with five one-year ordering periods.  Full and open competition will be used with an updated SPS to award follow-on production contracts.  Following JECP achieving Full Operational Capability, the Expeditionary Collective Protection-Enhanced Program will provide solutions to meet emerging and evolving User needs."

The CHRP will fulfill gaps as described in the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for safe intra-theater handling and transport of contaminated human remains (CHR).  The CHRP will provide protection by containing contaminated human remains (CHR) during recovery and transport from the point of fatality to the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Activity.  The CHRP will contain fluid and vapor CBRN hazards associated with the CHR to reduce the spread of contamination and reduce the hazard to personnel handling the CHR.  Successful development and procurement of the CHRP will provide Warfighters with the capability to safely handle, transport, and temporarily store or inter CHR in a theater of operations.\n\nThe Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&T) research developments to existing Decontamination or Contamination Mitigation ICD Programs of Record and guides S&T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  Leveraging the outcome of the Materiel Development Decision (3QFY11) directed Analysis of Alternatives, DFoS will develop a Family of Systems, to include equipment, to improve decontamination processes, and decontaminant solutions to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating NTA and chemical and biological warfare agents from personnel, equipment, vehicle interiors\/exteriors, terrain, and fixed facilities.  \n\nThe Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) program will provide decontamination capabilities for interiors of vehicles, ships, fixed site facilities, mobile maintenance facilities, aircraft and sensitive equipment inherent to the platform during air, ground and sea operations in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents\/contamination.  To accommodate the array of Service mission sets, the potential for varying system and\/or technology configurations may be required.  The JPID Preferred System Concept (PSC) may consist of multiple solution sets that provide increments of capability or one solution to address the various platforms and threats identified under the program.  No funding beyond FY12.\n\nThe Joint Service Sensitive Equipment Decontamination System (JSSED) program provides a thorough decontamination capability against chemical and biological warfare agents for high value or critical sensitive equipment that cannot be decontaminated using existing methods without damage.  JSSED efforts will be addressed under the JPID program of record from FY11 forward."

The CHRP acquisition will leverage Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS)\/Non-developmental Item (NDI) technologies that will lead to a fielded capability to fulfill gaps as described in the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for safe intra-theater handling and transport of contaminated human remains (CHR).  Successful development and procurement of the CHRP will provide Warfighters with the capability to safely handle, transport, and temporarily store or inter CHR in a theater of operations.  CHRP will employ a competitive prototyping effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of COTS\/NDI capabilities that can meet the CHRP requirements.  A RFP will solicit industry for COTS\/NDI technologies and may result in multiple contract awards to allow for competition throughout the acquisition process and minimize cost and schedule risk.\n\nDFoS\n\nThe Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) will utilize an incremental acquisition strategy to transition various developmental technology efforts (COTS, Joint Science Technology Office (JSTO), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) efforts, etc.) to meet high priority Warfighter capability gaps.  DFoS will support Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Programs of Record by guiding S&T efforts and transitioning mature technologies to meet program requirements.  The DFoS acquisition will leverage differing technologies in each subsystem to fulfill Warfighter capability gaps.  The JSEW, GPD, & CIDAS Programs will employ a CP effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of technologies (at a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4) that can meet the Contamination Mitigation ICD requirements.  A multi-phased Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be conducted to identify and evaluate the operational effectiveness of potential material solutions to satisfy Service requirements.  As each AoA phase is completed, individual systems and their respective phases of entry will be identified.  Industry and government labs will be solicited and through competitive prototyping, materiel solutions will be down-selected for continued development and fielding as a new or enhanced joint force capability.\n\nThe CHRP effort will leverage Commercial-off-the shelf (COTS)\/Non-developmental Item (NDI) technologies that will lead to a fielded capability to fulfill gaps as described in the ICD."

The JSAM Apache MPU-6 mask is for use with the Apache Integrated Helmet And Display Sighting System, JSAM MBU-25 (V)\/P Fixed Wing (FW) respirator is being developed for use on a limited number of U.S. Air Force Fixed Wing aircraft, and the JSAM MPU-5 Rotary Wing (RW) mask is being developed for use in the majority of Department of Defense RW aircraft.  The goal of the overall JSAM project is to develop, manufacture, field and sustain an aircrew respirator system that, in conjunction with a below-the-neck (BTN) clothing ensemble, will provide the capability for all aircrew to fly throughout their full operating envelope in an actual or perceived Chemical and Biological (CB) warfare\tenvironment.  The JSAM will be a lightweight CB protective mask that will be worn as CB protection for most Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine RW and FW aircrew members.  The JSAM FW will be the first and only CB protective mask in the DoD inventory that can provide anti-G protection, up to nine times the vertical force (Gz), for aircrew in high-performance aircraft.  All JSAM variants will be compatible with most BTN CB ensembles and existing aircrew life support equipment.  They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly, and an intercom for ground communication.  They will also provide flame and thermal protection, demist\/emergency demist, and anti-drowning features.\n\n(2) The Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE).  The objective of UIPE is to fully integrate chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) and toxic industrial material (TIM) protection into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask-helmet integration and protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased Warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.  The UIPE program will develop, integrate, test, procure and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements in form and fit over current systems; the program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the Warfighter.  Where appropriate modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.  UIPE is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the Warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  UIPE requirements are supported by an Initial Capability Document (ICD) and Capability Development Document (CDD), and a MS A.  UIPE is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and will ultimately provide CB protective equipment with improved operational capability to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Special Operations Command. \n\n(3) The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI): This project funds the advanced component development and prototypes of an improved filtration and protection capability against highest priority Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC) threats, addressing a current and significant capability gap to the operating force.  The effort is supported by the Capabilities Production Document for the JSGPM, which outlines the need for a robust TIC\/TIM protection capability.  It is expected that new capabilities demonstrated through the activities in this project will be leveraged and integrated into future increments of UIPE."

The JSAM must be compatible with current CB ensembles, provide flame protection, and reduce heat stress imposed by existing aircrew CB protective masks.  The JSAM must also be compatible with existing aircrew life support equipment (ALSE) and aircraft systems including weapons Systems (FoS) is a modular system that satisfies the requirements for different aircraft types and mission areas.  JSAM will replace all existing Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) and non-PBG CB aircrew respirators for all fixed and rotary wing aircrew.  JSAM is a respirator for individual aircrew that provides above-the-shoulder head, eye, respiratory, and percutaneous protection against CB warfare agents, and continuous protection JSAM MBU-25 FW utilizes an incremental acquisition strategy to provide aircrew of all Services with individual head-eye-respiratory protection against Chemical-Biological (CB) warfare agents. \n\nThe JSAM MBU-25 FW effort will test and field the top four most critical aircraft platforms through an SDD contract.  An RFP will be released to solicit industry for JSAM FW procurement using a full and open competition.  \n\nJSAM RW MPU-5 Low Rate Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) assets will be procured using contract options.  JSAM RW MPU-5 will provide individual head-eye-respiratory protection against Chemical-Biological (CB) warfare agents to pilots and aircrew of all rotary wing aircraft in the DoD inventory except the Army AH-64A\/D Helicopter.  JSAM RW MPU-5 Engineering and Manufacturing Development activities are performed via a contract awarded using a full and open competition, best value contracting strategy.  The existing contract includes options for LRIP and FRP.  A full and open competition, best value contracting strategy will be utilized to support additional Full Rate Production upon completion of the existing contract requirements and execution of options.\n\nJSGPM\n\nJSGPM (ARPI): The Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) will address improved masks protection, filter protection against TICs\/TIMs and improved profile and breathing resistance; and wearability compatibility\/integration.  This will be accomplished by: 1) Class-Based Analysis, 2) Filtration Advanced Screening Test (FAST), Desorption Study; and Advanced CBRN Filtration efforts.  Accomplishments to date include development of the prioritization approach and class based analysis; development of challenge levels for performance curve through modeling; FAST of ASZM-TDA, BSC, and EUMC against the priority TIC LIST; test of representative chemicals demonstrating the applicability of the class based analysis, and Scientific literature review of filter desorption.\n\nUIPE\n\nStrategy based on incremental development in accordance with prescribed Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Defense Joint Requirements Office (CBRND-JRO) approved capabilities documents.  The objective of the Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) is to fully integrate chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) and toxic industrial material (TIM) protection into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask-helmet integration, protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased Warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.  \n\nUIPE is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the Warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  UIPE will pursue a Modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Item (COTS\/NDI) Acquisition Strategy; full and open competition will be used.  Following Milestone (MS) B approval, contracts will be awarded and integrated Developmental Test\/Operational Test (DT\/OT) will be initiated on selected candidate system(s) during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  At the end of EMD, those candidates meeting UIPE requirements and that offer best value to the Government will move forward into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Multi-Service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E).  Following MOT&E, effective and suitable systems will be considered for Full-Rate Production (FRP).  UIPE requirements are supported by an Initial Capability Document (ICD) and Capability Development Document (CDD).  UIPE will ultimately provide CB protective equipment with improved operational capability to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Special Operations Command. \n\nFuture increments of UIPE shall be defined via separate capabilities documents.  Each successive increment will follow a similar path\/process from MS A or MS B through MS C\/FRP and will leverage preceding efforts to the greatest extent possible, maintaining commonality and synergy across all increments."

JEM is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and\/or incidents; high altitude releases, urban NBC environments; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battle space commanders and first responders must have a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.\n\nThe Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) will provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Integrated Early Warning, Analysis and Response capability to minimize the effects of hostile CBRN attacks, as well as accidents and incidents.  It will provide the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate warnings.  JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Service C4ISR Systems.  JWARN will transition from platform specific Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  JWARN will also provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional command and control (C2) systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing and future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will provide additional data processing to support the production of plans and reports, and access to specific CBRN information to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  The JWARN capability described above will be developed utilizing an incremental approach based on Service requirements and host system architecture.    \n\nThe JPEO-CBD SSA is a JPEO-CBD enterprise-wide, user developmental support and service organization focusing on development assistance and net-centric interoperability.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Information Assurance, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) and Data Management; interoperable and integrated net-centric, Service-oriented, composable solutions for CBD; and infusion of latest technologies into programs of record.  CBRN user community and related communities of interest have need for CBRN \"plug and play\" capability to allow interoperability and re-configurability across the enterprise.  The requirement for net-centric, composable solutions provides the near term foundation for the Warfighter's ability to communicate his CBRN solutions and interoperate with other Service operational systems.  It also supports a longer term ability to interoperate with related agencies and to reduce the Warfighter's CBRN footprint as technologies improve."

JEM is now being fielded in increments of capabilities.  Each increment will retain the functionality of the preceding increment.  The JEM development effort will be aligned with the evolving Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) architectures and technologies, as well as, with Service Command and Control (C2) systems.  JEM will develop three distinct increments of software.  JEM is a web-services based application and has been granted an Interoperability Certificate by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC).  The program plans to award competitive contracts using fixed price or cost-plus as appropriate.\n\nJWARN\n\nJWARN will develop and provide Integrated Early Warning capabilities to specified (Common Operating Environment (COE-based)) operational-level Service Command and Control (C2) systems at the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) level, extend the integration effort into the Service tactical (non COE-based) C2 systems, provide connectivity to legacy and newly developed sensors, and complete the development of JWARN. \n\nJWARN will extend these baseline capabilities to emerging, net-centric, Service C2 systems and Service CBRN sensors and detectors as they are developed and fielded.  JWARN will also ensure CBRN warning and reporting capabilities remain synchronized with the changing demands of the Warfighter while keeping pace with evolving C2 systems and their architectures, and will further evolve by integrating next generation sensors, detectors and emerging Medical and Biological Surveillance requirements into the CBRN Enterprise.\n\nSSA\n\nThe JPEO-CBD Software Support Activity (SSA) is a JPEO-CBD user support organization spanning and supporting all Joint Project Managers (JPMs) and JPEO-CBD Directorates.  The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all JPEO-CBD Programs of Record (PORs) that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS) across the JPEO and all JPMs.\n\nPhase 1a identifies JPEO-CBD JPMs and programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination with the JPMs and programs to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).\n\nPhase 1b established management and control measures for tracking and reporting progress of the various elements described in Phases 1 and 2.  This includes establishing, tracking, and performing configuration management of inventories and databases of IT systems and their states of interoperability and information assurance compliance.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).\n \nPhase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.

Specifically, this project includes: the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI), efforts in support of biosurveillance, and individual medical drugs and vaccines, such as Recombinant Botulinum A\/B and Plague vaccines, and the efforts to store and conduct required testing on Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines used to protect lab workers in the Special Immunization Program (SIP).\n\nThis project funds the development of reagents, assays, and diagnostic equipment for biological warfare agents (BWA) and expands chemical and biological detection capabilities.  It's primary mission is enhancing CBRN information sharing across the Department of Defense's (DoD) medical surveillance, public health, and chemical\/biological defense communities to enhance chemical and biological medical health situational awareness and coordinate integrated CBRN system solutions. \n\nEffective with the FY13 program, the MCMI program is now known as the ADM program.  ADM provides core and drug development services to include the establishment, commissioning, validation, and attainment of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)\/Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) for a Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Future funding will be used to maintain the facility in a state of readiness to support MCM product development, FDA licensure and manufacture of MCMs.  The ADM is one component of the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI), the others are a Test and Evaluation (T&E) facility to be established at Ft. Detrick, MD and an S&T component.  The efforts described address only the ADM capability.\n\nThe ADM effort is being executed in two phases.  Phase I is for the establishment, commissioning, and validation of the MCM capability.  This project funds the establishment of a facility(ies) to be located in the United States and its territories.  Two ADM suites, at Biosurety Level (BSL) 3 will be established during the base contract period, with options to incrementally increase capacity.  In Phase II the contractor team will support and maintain that capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (under the animal rule as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use.  This includes transition and integration of new technologies, from pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase with readiness to support simultaneous operations, through FDA licensure.\n\nTwo major medical programs critical to accomplishing the Biosurveillance mission are supported under this project in order to streamline collaboration and integration efforts, maintain continuity and efficiency, and to minimize duplication of efforts.  Specifically, these efforts include but are not limited to the Critical Reagents Program (CRP), and Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS), These efforts address the President's priority of developing a robust portfolio of cross-cutting resources and materiel solutions that support the National Security Strategy, National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, and the needs of the Warfighter.\n\nThe Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent, genomic reference materials (antigens,\tnucleic acids, and antibodies) and detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be horizontally inserted across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy will implement a formal, validated, advanced development process to transition new assays into production and integration with the appropriate detection\/diagnostic platform.\n\nThe Next Generation Diagnostic System addresses the mission needs identified in the CBRN Field Analytics ICD (2010).  The mission of the Next Generation Diagnostic System is to provide chemical, biological, and radiological analytical diagnostic systems.  NGDS Increment 1 materiel solutions will significantly improve analytical and diagnostic capability across the continuum of biological warfare threats and operations (peacetime, wartime, and deployed).  NGDS Increment 1 medical diagnostic capabilities will provide health care providers with more timely and accurate information to inform individual patient treatment.  Increment 1 clinical analytical and interconnectivity capabilities will provide commanders with situational awareness of biological warfare hazards to support Force Protection and Force Health Protection decision making.  \n\nThe (1) Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) Therapeutic Medical Countermeasures (MCM), which will provide broad spectrum (multi-agent), platform-based therapeutics against Ebola and Marburg viruses; (2) Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) MCM Increment 1, Many conditions result in the inability to provide effective vaccines to service members and civilians.  Effective vaccines do not exist for all known strains of influenza virus.  The emergence of a new pandemic strain with no existing effective vaccine or therapeutic is highly likely.  EID-Flu will provide a broad spectrum EID MCM to protect service members from naturally occurring, biologically or genetically engineered Influenza viruses.  EID Flu, a rapidly adaptable, broad spectrum therapeutic.  \n\n\nThe Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) under Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) funds the technology development phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these BW agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A\/B and Plague vaccines.  Efforts for medical biological defense product development involve production scale-up studies and validation, non-clinical studies, consistency manufacturing, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's \"Animal Rule\".  Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production.  JVAP anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  JVAP also has the mission to maintain IND vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases."

In addition, this strategy will implement a formal, validated advanced development process to transition new assays into production and integration with the appropriate detection\/diagnostic platform.\n\nNGDS\n\nThe Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) will develop and field an enhanced CBRN analytical and diagnostic system to the Joint force through an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  NGDS Increment 1 will follow a modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) acquisition strategy to field BWA diagnostic analytical devices to the Combat Health Support System.  Additional DoD-unique capabilities will be added to the initial commercial capabilities FY14-17.  Increment 1 MS A is planned 2nd Qtr FY12.  FY12 BA4 funds will be used to conduct operational assessments on the commercial prototypes immediately following MS A.  It is anticipated that NGDS Increment 1 will proceed from MS A to MS C in accordance with the modified COTS acquisition strategy and based on the demonstrated military utility from FY12-14 Competitive Prototyping and independent medical testing by AMEDD, and achieving submittal of a 510(k) application for FDA clearance of one BWA assay.\n\nEID FLU\n\nThe program goal for increment 1is the delivery of FDA-approved therapeutic against Orthomyxoviridae viruses - the cause of seasonal, epidemic, and pandemic influenza.  The objective is the delivery of an FDA-approved Post Exposure Prophylactic (PEP) and\/or therapeutic against Orthomyxoviridae viruses - the cause of seasonal, epidemic, and pandemic influenza, for use by to the Warfighter.  The acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of drug candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development Phase.  A technically mature candidate to meet Warfighter needs is being sought to reduce risk and accelerate delivery of MCM.  The Technology Readiness Level of candidate will determine the point of entry into the FDA clinical trial process.  Activities during this phase will be tailored to the technical level of the candidate and will include conducting pre-clinical animal safety studies and completion of human safety and efficacy trials required for FDA approval.  The performer(s) will submit a New Drug Application(s) for the Influenza therapeutic during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.\n\nHFV\n\nThe acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of drug candidates against the lethal Ebola and Marburg viruses to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development Phase.  Activities during this phase include conducting a pre-clinical animal safety studies, submission of Investigation New Drug Applications, and completion of Phase 1 human safety trials.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development, the program will conduct Phase 2 human clinical safety, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer(s) will submit a New Drug Application(s) for the Ebola and Marburg therapeutics during the EMD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.  This Department of Defense program is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the development of this therapeutic, and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.\n\nVAC BOT\n\nA prime systems contractor will function as the \"responsible head\" and license holder and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine.  Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.\n\nThe management lead for the program shifted to Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) at Milestone A.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human trial (Phase 1).\n\nDuring the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, the JVAP prime systems contract (PSC) will stabilize the vaccine formulation, validate the manufacturing processes and testing protocols, optimize the delivery systems and manufacture consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials are performed during this phase to provide additional safety data and determine dose and schedule.  The Phase 3 clinical trial also is conducted during this phase to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population.  To evaluate efficacy, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy FDA requirements for the \"Animal Rule.\"  The Milestone C, also the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision, will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  At the Milestone C, approval is granted to produce the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of vaccine material.  A Biologics Licensure Application is submitted to the FDA with all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.\n\nThis Department of Defense program is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the development of this vaccine.\n\nVAC PLG\n\nThe management lead for the program shifted to JVAP at Milestone A.

During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human trial (Phase 1).\n\nChemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) was mitigating technical program risk in the Plague Vaccine program by temporarily supporting development of both a US vaccine candidate and a United Kingdom vaccine candidate.  During the 2008 Resource Allocation Decision, the US Plague Vaccine candidate was selected for development through licensure under JVAP's Prime Systems Contract.  A Project Arrangement is in place with the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nDuring the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase (EMD), the vaccine developer will stabilize the vaccine formulation, validate the manufacturing processes and testing protocols, optimize the delivery systems, and manufacture consistency lots.

Project funds research and development of safety studies, manufacturing scale-up, process validation, drug interaction, performance test, and submission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug licensure application(s).  This program currently funds: (1) Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS), which consists of the drug midazolam in an autoinjector, to be used as a treatment for nerve agent-induced seizures and will be a replacement for the currently-fielded Convulsant Antidote for Nerve Agent (CANA) autoinjector, which uses diazepam; and (2) Bioscavenger, a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents."

Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems.  \n\nA contractor shall be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and\/or licenses.  During the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies will be conducted.  FDA approval of the countermeasure is an exit criterion for the EMD phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability will be purchased.  Subsequent purchases will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency.  Any post-marketing surveillance requested by the FDA will be the responsibility of the contractor.  The DoD is collaborating closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with the development of midazolam for both civilian and DoD applications.\n\nBSCAV\n\nBioscavenger acquisition strategy uses a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development Phase.  Initially, the Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Management Office (JPMO) exercised management oversight and a commercial partner as the system integrator during the Technology Development Phase to examine a human plasma-derived butyrylcholinesterase.  Activities included small scale manufacturing, conduct of pre-clinical animal safety studies, submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and completion of a Phase 1 human clinical safety study.  Subsequently, the MITS JPMO evaluated a goat-derived recombinant butyrylcholinesterase candidate and multiple small molecule candidates.  The small molecule candidates were not pursued beyond initial toxicology\/safety testing in animals.  For goat-derived Bioscavenger, activities included small scale manufacturing, conduct of pre-clinical animal safety studies, submission of an IND application, completion of a Phase 1 human clinical safety study and conduct of preliminary animal efficacy studies.  The goat-derived Bioscavenger candidate was discontinued after the product failed to demonstrate sufficient product performance in the preliminary animal efficacy studies.  During FY11, the program completed a system engineering trade off analysis resulting in a reduction of the initial operating capability\/full operational capability (IOC\/FOC) quantities and consequently an estimated cost avoidance of $1.14B over the product life.\n\nThe path forward will include a formal Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  Concurrently the MITS JPMO will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies and investigate additional product indications.  Subsequently, an expanded force solution prophylaxis will be pursued, once appropriate technologies have matured.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), the MITS JPMO will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  The RFP for product manufacturing will include options for transition to the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and delivery system and will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval.  The EMD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the MITS JPMO, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production and conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing surveillance studies."

There are no FDA-approved prophylactics, treatments, or biodosimetry capabilities against radiation exposure.  Treatment of R\/N casualties depends on effective use of multiple medical capabilities in an integrated manner.  Thus, this program supports the development of medical radiological countermeasures (MRADC) using a family-of-systems approach to provide a full spectrum capability to protect against the radiation threat which includes prophylactic, treatment, and biodosimetry capabilities.  Individual countermeasure solutions will be developed using a single step to a full capability (FDA approval) strategy.  Multiple contractors will serve as individual product integrators throughout development and will be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the FDA.  Each contractor will sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and\/or licenses.  The Technology Development phase includes pre-clinical studies, completion of manufacturing scale up, Phase 1 human clinical safety studies and initiation of manufacturing scale up activities, potentially utilizing the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  During the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies will be conducted.  FDA approval of the countermeasure is an exit criterion for the EMD phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be purchased.  Subsequent purchases will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Any post-marketing surveillance studies requested by the FDA will be conducted.\n\nMedical Radiological Countermeasures (MRADC) efforts include development of multiple countermeasures required to protect U.S. Forces against a myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation and to restore casualties to pre-exposure health.  MRADC shall reverse or limit radiation injury resulting in increased survival, decreased incapacity, and sustained operational effectiveness.  In addition, MRADC shall be effective against a broad range of radiation sources and types and shall be useable throughout the full spectrum of healthcare operations."

The DoD is working very closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which also has a radiation countermeasure program.  In support of the Integrated National Biodefense Portfolio, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was established between HHS and DoD to prevent duplication of efforts and create synergies in the development of MRADC.  In support of the MOU, the establishment of an interagency working group provides oversight and guidance to both agency programs and allows leveraging of knowledge and successes to advance the DoD MRADC program.  Under the MOU, MITS executes Interagency Agreements with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), HHS' advanced developer, to promote the science of MRADC.  \n\nThis project funds the advanced development of candidate therapeutic medical countermeasures to mitigate the consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation from nuclear or radiological attacks.  There are currently no FDA-approved products to treat Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  Exposure to ionizing radiation causes ARS which includes damage to blood-forming cells (hematopoietic system), gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system.  Medical countermeasures must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use prior to fielding.  Testing the efficacy of candidate drugs against lethal radiation exposure cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, surrogate animal models must be used to obtain FDA approval.  \n\nMedical Radiological Countermeasures (MRADC) efforts include development of multiple countermeasures required to protect U.S. Forces against a myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation and to restore casualties to pre-exposure health.

This project also funds CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.\n\nThe Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a set of test installations, facilities, and ranges which are regarded as \"national assets\".  These assets are sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation missions.  However, the MRTFB facilities and ranges are also available to commercial and other users on a reimbursable basis.  WDTC is designated as the primary element of the MRTFB to primarily conduct CB Defense test and evaluation.  The DW6 Project provides operating funds to WDTC in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2003 (Public Law 107-314 - section 232) to ensure that DoD test customers are only charged direct costs of testing and that overhead expenses are centrally funded.  It finances the required institutional test operating costs.  Institutional test operating costs include institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment.\n\nThe Laboratory Support (LS6) project funds laboratory infrastructure to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.\n\nThe management support (MS6) project, provides management support for the DoD CBDP to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ATSD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense and Chemical Demilitarization Programs (DATSD(CBD\/CD)); funds management by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); integration of Joint requirements, management of training and doctrine by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO); Joint RDA planning, input to the Annual Report to Congress and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PA&IO); review of Joint plans and the consolidated CB Defense POM Strategy by Army in its Executive Agent role.  \n\nThe management support project also funds the Test and Evaluation (T&E) Executive mission to establish test infrastructure investment strategy and adequate testing for Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical Biological Defense (CBD) systems and components throughout the systems' acquisition life cycle, as required in the RDA Plan under the JTIWG program.  The JTIWG program funds T&E Early Involvement, test threat planning, Fielded Equipment Assessments, T&E studies, and T&E Standards planning and development to support testing the CBD systems for all services to include radiological, nuclear, medical T&E efforts.  \n\nThe Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (O49) project funds the planning, conduct, evaluation, and reporting on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in response to requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.\n\nThis Budget Activity also funds Program Element 0605502BP, which supports the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  The overall objective of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) SBIR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a CB environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include CB detection; information assessment (identification, modeling, and intelligence); contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment."

Funding reflects compliance with National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2003 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002), Sec 232, requiring MRTFB to be fully funded so that DoD test customers are charged for direct costs only.  \n\nWDTC, a MRTFB, is the reliance center for all DoD CB defense testing and provides the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level three test facility.  Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the Service component IAW DoD 3200.11.\n\nWDTC uses state-of-the-art chemical and life sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, and equipment while totally containing chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides a fully instrumented outdoor range capability for testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents.  \n\nProjects programmed for testing at WDTC include, but are not limited to: Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble (UIPE); Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP); Decon Family of Systems (DFOS); CBRN Dismounted Recon System (DR-SKO); Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD); Joint Chem-Bio-Rad Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM); Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS); Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP); Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS); Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS); Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM); Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM); Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); Next Generation Chemical Point Detection (NGCPD).  The MRTFB also houses the Critical Reagents Program (CRP) Antigen Repository in support of testing diagnostic identification systems and developing vaccines.  In addition, it is able to provide instrumentation in support of medical countermeasures efforts."

Currently, each participating government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses.  The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet government R&D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the government or in the private sector.\n\nThe Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, PL 102-564.  STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program.  In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program.  Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program.\n\nSTTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences.  The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions.  Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non-profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness.  Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort.  Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work.  The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party.  The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&D budget vs. 2.5% for the SBIR Program).\n\nThe DoD has consolidated management and oversight of the CBDP into a single office within the OSD.  The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program.  The executive agent for the SBIR\/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.\n\nThe overall objective of the CBD SBIR\/STTR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a biological or chemical environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include chemical and biological detection; information assessment, which includes identification, modeling, and intelligence; contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment."

Also this Project provides for the JPEO-CBD Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nThe JEM is DoD's only accredited model for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment.  JEM is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and\/or incidents; high altitude releases, urban Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) environments; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battle space commanders and first responders must have a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.\n\nThe Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) will provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Integrated Early Warning, Analysis and Response capability to minimize the effects of hostile CBRN attacks, as well as accidents and incidents.  It will provide the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate warnings.  JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Service C4ISR Systems.  JWARN will transition from platform specific Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  JWARN will also provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional C2 systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing and future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will provide additional data processing to support the production of plans and reports, and access to specific CBRN information to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  The JWARN capability described above will be developed utilizing an incremental approach based on Service requirements and host system architecture.    \n\nThe JPEO-CBD SSA is a JPEO-CBD enterprise-wide, user developmental support and service organization focusing on development assistance and net-centric interoperability.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Information Assurance, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) and Data Management; interoperable and integrated net-centric, Service-oriented, composable solutions for CBD; and infusion of latest technologies into programs of record.  CBRN user community and related communities of interest have need for CBRN \"plug and play\" capability to allow interoperability and re-configurability across the enterprise.  The requirement for net-centric, composable solutions provides the near term foundation for the Warfighter's ability to communicate CBRN solutions and interoperate with other Service operational systems.  It also supports a longer term ability to interoperate with related agencies and to reduce the Warfighter's CBRN footprint as technologies improve."

JEM is now being fielded in increments of capabilities.  Each increment will retain the functionality of the preceding increment.  The JEM development effort will be aligned with the evolving Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) architectures and technologies, as well as, with Service Command and Control (C2) systems.  JEM will develop three distinct increments of software.  JEM is a web-services based application and has been granted an Interoperability Certificate by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC).  The program plans to award competitive contracts using fixed price or cost-plus as appropriate.\n\nJWARN\n\nJWARN will develop and provide Integrated Early Warning capabilities to specified (Common Operating Environment (COE-based)) operational-level Service Command and Control (C2) systems at the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) level, extend the integration effort into the Service tactical (non COE-based) C2 systems, provide connectivity to legacy and newly developed sensors, and complete the development of JWARN. \n\nJWARN will extend these baseline capabilities to emerging, net-centric, Service C2 systems and Service CBRN sensors and detectors as they are developed and fielded.  JWARN will also ensure CBRN warning and reporting capabilities remain synchronized with the changing demands of the Warfighter while keeping pace with evolving C2 systems and their architectures, and will further evolve by integrating next generation sensors, detectors and emerging Medical and Biological Surveillance requirements into the CBRN Enterprise.\n\nSSA\n\nThe JPEO-CBD Software Support Activity (SSA) is a JPEO-CBD user support organization spanning and supporting all Joint Project Managers (JPMs) and JPEO-CBD Directorates.  The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all JPEO-CBD Programs of Record (PORs) that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS) across the JPEO and all JPMs.\n\nPhase 1a identifies JPEO-CBD JPMs and programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination with the JPMs and programs to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).\n\nPhase 1b established management and control measures for tracking and reporting progress of the various elements described in Phases 1 and 2.  This includes establishing, tracking, and performing configuration management of inventories and databases of IT systems and their states of interoperability and information assurance compliance.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).\n \nPhase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.

JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development\/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacteria and virus agents in environmental surveillance sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, e.g. Anthrax, Plague, Tularemia, Q-Fever, H5 Avian, Influenza A&B, etc.  An expanded influenza detection panel covering six new assays were cleared on Sept 13, 2011.  Additionally, the JBAIDS Platinum Path Extraction Kit (PPEK) Bridging Study contract was awarded on Oct 20, 2011; this study will allow the PPEK to be used on the Anthrax, Plague, and Tularemia IVD kits.  JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  Future JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2016 using MB7 RDT&E funding, will focus on adding new surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays and starting the Glanders (Burkholderia) IVD kit effort.  Also the development team will focus on completing two Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review.  These sustainment RDT&E funds will also be used to conduct software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer\/laptop parts obsolescence."

The Basic Research Initiative program provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers drawn primarily from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry.  This leverages Department of Defense\u2019s $2 billion annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting Weapons of Mass Destruction-related defense missions and by improving Agency knowledge of other research efforts of potential benefit to DTRA nonproliferation, counterproliferation and consequence management efforts.  \n\nThese efforts are closely coordinated with the Chem-Bio Technology portfolio which executes a basic research program under the joint Chem-Bio Defense Program.  Agency research interests are coordinated with those of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Service basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.    \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to a reduction in the number of grants awarded and the elimination of dedicated support to transition discoveries to DTRA applied research."

This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense level guidance\/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy, Unified Command Plan, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Counterproliferation Interdiction, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Military Strategy, Global Development of Forces, Global Employment of Forces, National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  Three of these objectives are to deter the use of WMD, reduce the present threat, and to prepare for the future threat.  A focused and strong threat reduction technology base is critical to achieving these objectives and is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up its combat support mission.  DTRA has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.\n  \nProject RA provides systems engineering and analysis support across all other Projects, innovative counterproliferation research, and technical advisory reachback support on WMD effects and consequences.   \n\nProject RE provides research and development support to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) to forecast plausible terrorist WMD threats for planning and conducting operations to combat WMD terrorism. Follow-on funding for this project can be found in the Proliferation Prevention and Defeat; 0603160BR, budget exhibit.\n\nProject RF develops technologies, systems and procedures to detect, identify, track, tag, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, or materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  \n\nProject RG develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.\n\nProject RI provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  \n\nProject RL develops nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions.  \n\nProject RM provides (1) full-scale testing of counter WMD weapon effects, sensor performance, and weapon delivery optimization, (2) weapon effects modeling, and (3) the Defense Threat Reduction Agency Experimentation Lab.  \n   \nProject RR provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated WMD facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the DoD, the Services, the Combatant Commanders and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets. \n\nProject RT provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets located in underground facilities and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Follow-on funding for this project can be found in the Proliferation Prevention and Defeat; 0603160BR, budget exhibit.  \n\nProject RU provides (1) strategic studies to support DoD, (2) Decision support tools and analysis to support combating WMD research and development investments, and (3) early applied research for technology development."

The systems engineering effort provides research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capability necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  It also conducts the development, validation and fielding of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) as a part of the U.S. commitment under arms control treaties.  The innovative counterproliferation effort conducts research and development to investigate, identify, develop and transition short term, high payoff technologies from Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), other government agencies, industry, academia and international Science and Technology partners into the respective DTRA and other research and development programs and to end user organizations.  The technical reachback effort provides 24 hours, 7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This project also provides support to international Counter-WMD science and technology cooperation through the DTRA London Office.\n\t\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominantly due to reduced investment in systems engineering collaboration with external partners and customers and the slowing development and fielding of innovative technologies to the warfighter."

This is directly linked to the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) priority objectives to prevent and deter conflict and prepare to defeat adversaries and succeed in a wide range of contingencies, and the key missions of deter and defeat aggression in anti-access environments; and prevent proliferation and counter weapons of mass destruction.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating the technologies into the weapons and delivery systems most relevant to the COCOMs\u2019 WMD Defeat CONOPS for their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  The primary focus of current efforts is defeating an adversary's WMD capability protected in the confines of hardened and protected bunker and tunnel facilities.  Included in this program is the development of offensive defeat capabilities, WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of the next generation capability as well as the advanced modeling and simulation necessary for ensuring optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the QDR and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in Joint Capability Integrated Development (JCID) documents, Service requirements documents, and COCOMs and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal C-WMD capability.  The efforts contained in the program further develop, mature, and demonstrate technology and weapon system concepts that greatly enhance the warfighters' capability to defeat the spectrum of weapons of mass destruction in hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and elsewhere throughout the lifecycle functions from production to weaponization, storage, and employment.\n\nThe program\u2019s investment approach is based on a strategic top-down analysis of threat vulnerabilities and aligned with stated organizational core competencies and lines of operations aimed at the defeat of (1) the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) the ability to deliver the same, and (3) the support networks, both physical and non-physical, enabling both.  The program places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within some mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Our end-state is to provide COCOMs with accurate and timely WMD defeat expertise, tailored technologies, and customized solutions that provide offensive weapons and capabilities to combat WMD in any target while mitigating collateral contamination effects.  Without these capabilities our nation cannot effectively hold at risk our adversaries\u2019 WMD capabilities thus giving them strategic advantage.\n\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 represents an efficiency reduction to contract support services as part of the DoD reform agenda to reduce reliance on service support contractors."

Emphasis is on ionizing radiation effects. The Nuclear Survivability project provides Radiation Hardened (RadHard) Microelectronics and Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation research.  Funding in this project also supports the expanding role of the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) program into Science & Technology development for human survivability.\n\nThe NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct research in radiation effects, and validate computational models.  The Nuclear Survivability Experimental Capabilities program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration and the United Kingdom Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new, enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays and neutrons.\n \nThe Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides support for the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group (JAIEG) and the international Weapon Effects Steering Committee (WESC) that was called the NWE Users\u2019 Group.  The WESC establishes standards for U.S. and U.K nuclear weapons effects simulation codes and models as defined and prioritized by the nuclear community, and serves as a forum for sharing information on nuclear technologies, gaps and plans.\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to increased investment in nuclear weapons effects efforts as part of a redirection of the nuclear detection portfolio toward a more holistic nuclear THREAT detection portfolio that integrates both passive and active radiation detection into a comprehensive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) solution."

The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology (WEP) tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates\/modifies software to more accurately model cratering effects, fragmentation (both primary & secondary), internal air blast, equipment\/container damage, structural response, and penetration.  These efforts will lead to advanced modeling capability in the countering WMD tools, Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) weaponeering and Vulnerability Assessment and Protection Option (VAPO) force\/structure protection.  The Advanced Energetics & Counter WMD Weapons Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD\/HDB targets. The Advanced Energetics Program also develops new high energy systems well above chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast\/frag warhead technology.\n  \nThe DTRA Experimentation Lab Capability is an Agency-wide capability that assures the timely acquisition, synchronization, correlation and delivery of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) consequence management and mitigation data necessary in combating WMD.  The DTRA Experimentation Lab will be the \u201ckey enabler\u201d allowing the Agency to transform successfully into an interoperable DoD Science and Technology environment.  Through the use of the DTRA Experimentation Lab, DTRA will be able to shape and improve military situational awareness independent of time or location, effectively shorten decision cycles in a CBRNE event, and extend DTRA\u2019s knowledge base externally through collaborative technologies.\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the reallocation of funds from infrastructure development in Project RR - Test Infrastructure to weapons effects and planning tools in Project RM \u2013 Battle Management to properly align mission responsibilities."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include aboveground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the reallocation of funds from infrastructure development in Project RR - Test Infrastructure to weapons effects and Planning tools in Project RM - Battle Management, and reduced investment in test infrastructure environment restoration support and the WMD National Test Bed (TB)."

It may be possible, however, to achieve target defeat objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires more information, more detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available weapons, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets located in underground facilities and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support either physical or functional defeat.  Extending this activity and applying these processes to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) target characterization and threat analysis presents the next technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project now consists of three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technology Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technology Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technology Support.  Follow-on funding for this project can be found in the Proliferation Prevention and Defeat; 0603160BR, budget exhibit."

The advancement of technology and science into applied technology development effort focus upon increasing the stability and utility of mid-to-long term, moderate risk but high payoff science, and emerging technologies for transition to other Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) applied technology programs.  This effort serves as the bridge between the bench scientist and the applied technologist. The university partnership provides innovative research, scientific experts, post-doctoral fellowships, and scholarships to US students directly supporting cutting edge science, international cooperation programs and the next generation workforce. The strategic studies address challenges in reducing the threat from WMD based on an assessment of the future national security environment. They also develop and maintain an evolving analytical vision of necessary and sufficient capabilities to protect the U.S. and allied forces and citizens from nuclear, biological, and chemical attack and identify gaps in these capabilities and initiate programs to fill them.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the elimination of University Strategic Partnerships activities, reduced efforts in Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism (CWMD-T), and the transfer of advanced systems concepts funding from project RU \u2013 Fundamental research for combating WMD to project RA \u2013 Systems Engineering and Innovation to perform strategic research and dialogues."

To accomplish this objective, seven project areas were developed: RA - Systems Engineering and Innovation, RE - Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF - Detection Technology, RG - Counter WMD Weapons & Capabilities, RI - Nuclear Survivability, \nRM - WMD Battle Management, and RT - Target Assessment Technologies.  This supports technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01).  The missions and plans of these projects are described below and in the R-2a Budget Exhibits.  \n\nProject RA provides the research and development both for systems engineering and analysis support across all other projects and innovative counterproliferation research and technical reachback support.\n\nProject RE provides research and development support to Joint U.S. Military Forces, specifically U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Device Defeat; counter-WMD technologies for warfighters; the USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) ; and oversight of counterproliferation (CP) research and development resources sent directly to USSOCOM for warfighter-unique CP technologies.\n\nProject RF develops technologies, systems and procedures for post-detonation nuclear forensics, and to detect, identify, track, tag, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, or materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  \n\nProject RG develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.\n\nProject RI provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  \n\nProject RL develops nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions.  Related funding for this project can be found in the WMD Defeat Technologies: 0602718BR, budget exhibit.\n\nProject RM provides (1) full-scale testing of counter WMD weapon effects, sensor performance, and weapon delivery optimization, (2) weapon effects modeling, and (3) the Defense Threat Reduction Agency Experimentation Lab.  \n   \nProject RR provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Services, the Combatant Commanders, and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets.  Related funding for this project can be found in the WMD Defeat Technologies: 0602718BR, budget exhibit.\n\nProject RT provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize hard and deeply buried targets and then assess the results of attacks against those targets."

The systems engineering effort provides research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capability necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  This includes analysis of National, Department of Defense (DoD) and other Federal agencies' strategic guidance and plans in the combating WMD, Combating Terrorism and Homeland Defense arenas through analytical political-military and technical studies, workshops and conferences.  It also provides the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on-site support to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) with a current primary focus on support to U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), NATO, and SHAPE in combating WMD and maintaining the NATO nuclear deterrent.  A significant element of this project includes support to Command Elements and the warfighting Combatant Commands (COCOMs) on strategies for reducing\/countering the WMD threat in the COCOMs Areas of Responsibility.  This project also provides for the solution to the Secretary of Defense mandate for DTRA to account, maintain, report, and track the National Nuclear Weapons Stockpile & Nuclear Weapon-Related Materiel during peacetime, crisis, and wartime.  In support of national requirements necessary to maintain a viable nuclear deterrent, the Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services provide a platform to ensure continued sustainability and viability of the nuclear weapon stockpile. \n\nThe FY 2012 to FY 2013 decrease is predominately due to the net effect of a one time increased investment for the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) in FY 2012 and a realignment of funding from Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to PE 0602718BR for information technology test and engineering program for Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) 3."

This project supports Joint U.S. Military Forces, and in particular, the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  This research and development support to USSOCOM is one of the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force, and therefore a top priority for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The following efforts are included in this project:\n\nProvide oversight for Counterproliferation (CP) research and development resources sent directly to USSOCOM that are used to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM\u2019s Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CT\/CP) mission.  New CT\/CP technologies are developed under USSOCOM management that provides warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.\n\nThe Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Device Defeat effort develops innovative technologies, energetic materials, and software programs to identify, defeat, contain, and mitigate WMD capable Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  DTRA has been delegated the responsibilities and the authority to act as Task Lead on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide leadership, integration, development, and testing as the primary U.S. Government coordinator for the National Implementation Plan WMD-Terrorism Task 5.4.4.  The EOD Device Defeat effort adds targeted rapid development of tools, techniques, and procedures for the access and advanced diagnostics and defeat of WMD systems and IEDs.  The focus of the activity is prototype development and transition of promising technologies to the warfighters for procurement.\n\nThe USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) addresses Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Unified Command Plan (UCP) for integrating and synchronizing Defense-wide operations and activities to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD.\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  One portion of this program involves a proof of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program is developing technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers along multiple nodes concurrently or simultaneously within the terrorist pathway to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces in support of CT\/CP offensive operations.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment for CWMD-T testing and defeat programs."

This is directly linked to the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) priority objectives to prevent and deter conflict and prepare to defeat adversaries and succeed in a wide range of contingencies, and the key missions of deter and defeat aggression in anti-access environments; and prevent proliferation and counter weapons of mass destruction.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating those technologies into the weapons and delivery systems most relevant to the COCOMs\u2019 WMD Defeat CONOPS for their AOR.  The primary focus of current efforts is defeating an adversary's WMD capability protected in the confines of hardened and protected bunker and tunnel facilities.  Included in this program is the development of offensive defeat capabilities, WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation  of the next generation capability as well as the advanced modeling and simulation necessary for ensuring optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the QDR and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in Joint Capability Integrated Development (JCID) documents, Service requirements documents, and COCOMs and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal C-WMD capability.  The efforts contained in the program further develop, mature, and demonstrate technology and weapon system concepts that greatly enhance the warfighters' capability to defeat the spectrum of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and elsewhere throughout the lifecycle functions from production to weaponization, storage, and employment.\n\nThe program\u2019s investment approach is based on a strategic top-down analysis of threat vulnerabilities and aligned with stated organizational core competencies and lines of operations aimed at the defeat of (1) the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) the ability to deliver the same, and (3) the support networks, both physical and non-physical, enabling both.  The program places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within some mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Our end-state is to provide COCOMs with accurate and timely WMD defeat expertise, tailored technologies, and customized solutions that provide offensive weapons and capabilities to combat WMD in any target while mitigating collateral contamination effects.  Without these capabilities our nation cannot effectively hold at risk our adversaries\u2019 WMD capabilities thus giving them strategic advantage.\n \nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to increased investment in Counter WMD Hard Target Defeat Weapons Development to mature and demonstrate innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capability for the physical or functional defeat of the WMD structures, functions, and\/or the agents themselves with a minimum of collateral effects from incidental release of agent."

This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high performance prototype microelectronics to support the availability of RHM and photonics for DoD missions from both private sector and government organizations. \n\nMighty Guardian Force-on-Force Tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments; operational, storage and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to service procurement.\n\nNuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and Loss of Assured Safety due to accidents, fires or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of COCOMs and Services.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 represents an efficiency reduction to contract support services as part of the DOD reform agenda to reduce reliance on service support contractors."

Deliver modernized, validated and fast running attack planning tools and integrating software.  Leverage attack planning tools to support force protection planners and vulnerability assessment teams. \n\nDevelop, integrate, demonstrate and transition emerging\/innovative technologies to provide the warfighter with an enhanced near real-time combat and battle damage assessment capability.  Capability is achieved through the development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and weapon-based sensors, platforms, taggants, seekers and other innovative technologies to; remotely sense, identify, track and target WMD-related threats; perform battle damage assessment\/indication of strikes against these threats; and locate, track, collect, detect, selectively identify, and characterize Chemical Weapon and Biological Weapon aerosol agents released during these WMD counterforce strikes."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include aboveground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD. Related funding for this project can be found in the WMD Defeat Technologies; 0602718BR, budget exhibit."

It may be possible, however, to achieve target defeat objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires more information, more detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available weapons, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets located in underground facilities and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Extending this activity and applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents the next technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project consists of three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technology Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technology Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technology Support.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment in Counter-WMD Analysis Cell collaboration with the National Counterproliferation Center (NCPC) and the Intelligence Community."

These capabilities are used by a wide range of planners, managers, and operational and technical personnel facing the full spectrum of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives threats.  The IWMDT Codes functional area develops analysis and simulation codes, and then integrates the codes into the IWMDT architecture. These efforts are unique to this effort across the Department of Defense (DoD) and directly supports analysis capabilities in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Studies and Analysis Group, and Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD CAPE), US Pacific Command and United States Forces Korea offices, Republic of Korea Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Defense Taiwan, as well as providing unique simulation capabilities to US Joint Forces Command and the Air Force Distributed Mission Operation Center.

IWMDT was funded in 2004 by a competitive CPAF contract for $12.425M over a 3-year period.  At end of FY 2006, its follow-on contract was awarded with an initial $.300M increment.  IWMDT program efforts have continued into FY 2011 with $28.962M now applied.  Likewise, the NuCS program was funded under a competitive CPFF contract over a 3-year period with funding of $5.913M applied through FY 2008; a follow-on contract has now been awarded with initial funding to date of $2.356M to continue program efforts, this effort is not funded past FY11 under this line.  COE was funded under a competitive CPFF contract with increments to date of $6.566M total.   NUCS and COE will no longer be funded under this line.  In CY 2012 IWMDT will be openly competed under the new DTRA ID\/IQ for approx $24.000M for FY2014-16."

ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  \n\nEngineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.\n\nInformation and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution\/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.

Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the SOF Special Technology Development efforts include:  \n\n  \u2022  Special Operations Forces Special Technology Sub-Project.  This sub-project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.\n\n  \u2022 Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technologies Sub-Project.  TTL funds SOF unique ATDs identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL rapidly prototypes and expeditiously transitions projects from laboratory to acquisition Programs of Record\/operational use to address SOF capability deficiencies.\n \n  \u2022 Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover)."

It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media & Product Selection, Distribution & Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware\/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  \n\nBroadcast and Dissemination Modernization.  Develops emerging technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities for MISO forces. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advance Technology Demonstrations and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended systems, especially in denied areas; focused\/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of long-loiter broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environment; and technologies that automate and improve planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities."

The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, interagency, and Coalition tactical ISR PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by an engineering development team.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change."

Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 is the first year USSOCOM is participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public\/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions."

Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects."

                        "val": "Aviation Systems Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser (HEL); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.  \n\nCV-22 Development:\nThe CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF\/TA (Silent Knight) radar program provides long-range, night\/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable\/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following\/avoidance radar.\n\nMission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThe Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. \n\nAC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging\/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.\n\nRotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters."

The DCM suite is an integrated package of existing and future aircraft defensive systems which provides situational awareness and threat response processing; this includes the RFCM system, and future defensive systems.  RFCM program provides SOF-unique aircraft defensive capabilities required for SOF missions.\n\n\u2022 PSP for SOF supports systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP and integration, installation, and test on host MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force for the AC-130H, AC-130W and AC-130U recapitalization, as well as current SOF C-130s,  AC-130Js and AC-130Ws, and other SOF platforms.  Missions for the AC-130 aircraft include, but are not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Air Interdiction, and Armed Reconnaissance.  PSP is modular, scalable, and platform neutral.\n \n\u2022 PSP High Energy Laser (HEL) supports demonstration of HEL weapon onto AC-130 platforms.  HEL efforts include system design and evaluation of mature laser, beam director, power, and thermal subsystems.  The HEL components will be designed for modular upgrades and integrated with the PSP system.\n\n\u2022 C-130 SOF Common TF\/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports integration and test of a TF\/TA radar and on-board processor to provide a multi-mode terrain following capability on MC-130J aircraft.  Crew systems integration efforts include modifications to aircraft controls and displays to automate TF\/TA flight management and reduce pilot, copilot and Combat Systems Officer workload during missions previously performed by five aircrew members on legacy C-130 tankers and penetrators. This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.\n\n\u2022 SOF Common TF\/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), qualification, and operational flight testing of a SOF common TF\/TA LPI\/LPD radar to defeat advanced passive detection threats while maintaining ability to fly safe TF.  This radar is targeted for use on MH-47G heavy assault helicopters, MH-60M medium assault helicopters, MC-130J Commando II and CV-22 Osprey aircraft.\n\n\u2022 ISR Payload Sensor Technology supports development, integration, and testing of sensor miniaturization efforts to adapt large (Group 4-5) unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR capabilities on all SOF UAS ISR platforms."

The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.\n\nSpecial Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J Gunship configuration. The AC-130J aircraft perform close air support (CAS), air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions.  The MC-130J aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.\n\nAviation Systems funds develop, integrate, and test aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits. Provides PSP aircraft infrastructure development."

                                        "val": "This project develops\/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improved lethality and enhanced aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A\/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and\/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components to the extent possible and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A\/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.\n\n\u2022  MH-60M Modification and Upgrades develops technologies to improve safety of the MH-60 and decrease operational costs. Efforts include, but are not limited to, DOD MH-60 engineering changes, product improvements to SOF unique equipment and munitions during testing. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.\n\n\u2022  MH-60M Block Upgrades provides the development, integration, and qualification efforts on the MH-60 helicopter to include flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. \n\n\u2022  Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aircrew.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in Degraded Visual Environments. This program addresses SOF-unique requirements for rapid fielding and weight limitations, capitalizes on the unique skills of the SOF aviator while integrating with SOF-unique avionics, and leverages existing sensors on SOF aircraft to the maximum extent possible.\n\n \u2022  Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-unique modifications to the common aircraft.\n\n\u2022  Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird with potential use on the MH-60 and MH-47 aircraft. The IRCM program will integrate and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and countermeasure capability and infrared suppressor. The A\/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the SOF inventory without protection from infrared guided and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense missiles.\n\n\u2022  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS) and Engine Barrier Filter. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats and enhance aircraft self-protection.\n\n\u2022  Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering\/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System.  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit: (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft\u2019s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.\n\n\u2022  Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program improves targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness on ARSOA platforms. This program mitigates obsolescence and increases functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.\n\n\u2022  The Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Upgrades program develops, integrates, and tests critical active and passive SOF-unique aircraft survivability equipment to counter the acknowledged high proliferation of advanced Surface-to-Air (SA) threat systems for the A\/MH-6, MH-60, and MH-47.  Additionally, these threat systems are technically evolving at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid counter system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and pre-planned product improvements\/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, flares, and associated qualification testing.\n\n\u2022  Secure Real Time Video (SRTV) ensures that while en route to an objective, SOF aircrews and operators have access to the latest data collected on the objective enabling them to maintain situational awareness and improve survivability.  This project will integrate and test software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time full motion video intelligence."

Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments."

                                        "val": "This sub-project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Special Operations Tactical Video System\/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (TVS\/RSTA);  Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).\n\nU.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    \n\nOPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    \n\n\u2022   NSSS.  This program provides research and development and rapid prototyping as the HQ SOCOM Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by leveraging National Geospatial-Intelligence (NGA) and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units to include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid development, fielding and deployment, and focus on transitioning to SOCOM Programs of Records (POR). These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM\u2019s existing Military Intelligence Programs.  Focus items include:  Small Unmanned Aircraft System Multi-Intelligence geo-location and targeting capabilities with a Rapid Reliable Targeting system that supports NGA CAT1 level targeting, enhanced GEOINT processing capabilities by fusing Light Detection and Ranging with National Technical Means (NTM) and the Enhanced Image Rendering Tool, which allows sharing of NTM Imagery with coalition forces.  NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM\u2019s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automate radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.\n\n\u2022   JTWS.  The JTWS System of Systems (SoS) enables the SOF Cryptologic Operator to collect, process, locate and exploit threat communications signals of interest in order to provide timely, relevant, and responsive intelligence, cross-cueing, and threat avoidance information directly to the SOF Commanders.  The JTWS SoS is assembled in four variants: Ground SIGINT Kit; Maritime; Air; and Unmanned Aerial Systems.  Each variant has additional requirements for Communications Intelligence, Electronic Intelligence, and Precision Geo-location.\n\n\u2022   HF-TTL.  This program utilizes a commodity procurement strategy to provide SOF warfighters with the necessary tools to find, fix, and finish terrorist networks through the emplacement of sophisticated tags and devices that feed into an integrated architecture.  HF-TTL provides Global Combatant Commanders (GCC) and SOF operators with an immediate capability to tag, track, and locate people, things, and activities.  The HF-TTL program provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners.  The mission sets comprise a mix of different classes of tags and their associated detection, interrogation, viewing, tracking, and communications systems that are fielded annually to SOF Components and TSOC based upon dynamic and emergent SOF operational requirements.  \n\n\u2022  TVS\/RSTA.  This program provides SOF with critical Special Reconnaissance (SR) equipment that directly supports the planning and execution of SOF missions.  This capability allows the SOF warfighter to meet SOF SR mission requirements to find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate information of an adversary\u2019s movement, construct, identification, location; and associated things and activities.  TVS\/RSTA provides GCC and SOF operators with an immediate capability to visually and electronically acquire people, things, and activities and provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners and Commanders.  The program Family of Systems (FoS) consists of interoperable equipment to capture and transfer near-real-time ground-based, tactical day\/night\/reduced visibility, imagery, video, and electronic proximity and movement sensing, all capable of dissemination through SOF organic, global C4I, and commercial communications infrastructures.\n\nABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON) \n\n\u2022 SOFPREP.  This program serves as the intelligence focal point for production of SOF enhanced GEOINT (maps, imagery, and terrain data) and 3D scene visualization databases. SOFPREP gathers, processes, exploits, disseminates, and manages classified high resolution 3D databases and GEOINT data in support of SOF training, mission rehearsal, and execution preparation systems. The program builds the SOF common geospatial environment and manages the authoritative database of SOF-specific GEOINT terrain data.  SOFPREP is a NGA-certified co-producer in support of time-sensitive SOF specific requirements. \n\n\u2022   ISP.  This program collects and produces current, detailed, tactical planning data to support military operations to counter threats against U.S. citizens, interests, and property located both domestically and overseas. ISP products are specifically tailored packages that provide operational information, as well as intelligence data for use by DOD and the U.S. Department of State to support operational planners for counter-terrorism operations, evacuations, and other rescue missions.\n\n\u2022   SSE.  This program provides the capability to exploit personnel, documents, electronic data, material, and forensic evidence on sensitive sites\/objectives.  Biometric kits allow collection and transmission of unique, measurable biometric signatures from personnel, including live\/latent fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features.  It also provides a means to verify against and enroll subjects into the DOD authoritative database, and to query that database to support hold or release decisions. Forensic kits enable on-objective linking of events to specific persons through chemical analysis, latent fingerprints, cell phones and computer data analysis, and deoxyribonucleic acid collection. Exploitation Analysis Centers provide theater-level mobile forensic capabilities for more in-depth exploitation of captured evidence."

This is accomplished by partnering with existing IC POR to incorporate SOF mission requirements into current and developing technologies and assets.  This leveraging of funds increases national and commercial systems awareness, demonstrates the tactical utility of national systems and commercial data, tests technologies and evaluates operational concepts in biennial Joint Staff Special Projects, and allows for the transition of promising concepts and technologies to other SOF program offices for execution.\n\n\u2022  JTWS is a SoS leveraging commercial technologies and partnerships with other government agencies.  The POR will identify Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)\/Government Off The Shelf capabilities requiring minimal modifications and only use new development when necessary. JTWS will address the continuously evolving threat environments on the Ground, Air, Maritime, and Unmanned Aircraft System variants, leverage existing partnerships with the National Security Agency and other government partners to integrate and sustain systems based on prioritized need from the Components and as emerging threats require technology modernizations.

                        "val": "This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  \n\nMISO:\nThis project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production\/distribution\/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.\n\nWeapons Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.\n\nSoldier Protection and Survival Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system development and testing to meet continually emerging Counter RC-IED threats. \n\nBody Armor and Associated Equipment:\nThis project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.\n\nVisual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular\/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.\n\nCommunications Equipment and Electronics Systems:\nThis project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.\n\nTactical Systems Development:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. \n\nTactical Radio Systems:\nThis project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied\/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.\n\nMunitions Development:\nThis project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign\/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements."

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders and includes: \n\n\u2022 Media Production and Broadcast Systems support the Media Production Center (MPC) and the Fly Away Broadcast System (FABS) MISO missions.  The MPC includes the fixed site MPC with light and medium media production capability.  FABS is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), cellular, and television (TV) transmitters.  \n\n\u2022 Long Range Broadcast System (LRBS) is a family of broadcast systems intended to be integrated into multiple manned and unmanned, long-loiter aerial systems with the capability of broadcasting in AM, FM, SW, TV, Very High Frequency (VHF), TV Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and cellular (Short Message Service, Multi-Media Messaging Service, and Voice).  This system provides the capability of broadcasting MISO messages via multiple mediums into permissive, semi-permissive, and denied foreign areas.\n\n\u2022 FABS is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of AM, FM, SW, cellular, and TV transmitters.\n\n\u2022 Family Of Loudspeakers (FOL) is a portable loudspeaker system that is capable of disseminating high quality recorded and live audio messages by MISO Forces in varied geographical areas and climate conditions.  The new variant of the FOL is the Next Generation Loudspeaker System (NGLS).  The NGLS consists of a Dismounted and Mounted variants that are lighter, smaller, and louder than legacy speaker systems, with added clarity and durability."

Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems, as well load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF, while conducting varied missions, and personnel safety equipment.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\nSOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system mounts.  \n\nTactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication, mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. \n\nCounter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future RC-IED threats used by terrorist networks."

Sensor technology being developed includes image intensification thermal imaging, short wave infrared, multi-spectral, fusion, and other sensor types.  Developments will decrease weight, increase range, increase situational awareness, provide data, image processing, image filtering, determine wind speed, observe bullet trace, and sensor fusion to be able to detect, identify, classify and engage targets at greater ranges.  These projects ensure SOF systems shall remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success."

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   \n\nUSSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. \n\n\u2022  SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity, voice, data, video tele-conferencing (VTC), and full motion video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms, transport for intelligence variants, technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.\n\n\u2022  Civil Information Management (CIM).  The CIM Data Processing System (CIMDPS) is an automation system that assists active Civil Affairs (CA) and others engaged in civil-military operations to collect, process, analyze, maintain, mine, and deliver Civil Information and analysis products in support of military operations.  \n\n\u2022  The Special Communications (SPCOM) Enterprise program, formerly justified as the Special Communication Enterprise (SCE) includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field) for worldwide deployed SOF units, often in austere environments with heavy adversarial monitoring."

Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.\n\n- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. The TACLAN consists of Suites, Mission Planning Kits and Field Computing Devices, Coalition Local Area Network, and Full Motion Video Kits."

These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&T) capabilities for SOF.\n\nGroup 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications to ground control stations. SAFC develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities that address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges.

The Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  The current family of SOF tactical vehicles include: individual mobility vehicles, light mobility vehicles, medium mobility vehicles, non-standard commercial vehicles, and heavy mobility vehicles.     \n\nFamily of Special Operations Vehicles (FSOV).  This initiative provides for product improvements in the areas of suspension, power management, armor protection and unique vehicle design for all SOF tactical vehicle configurations.  Designs must be standardized across all SOF Components that utilize a tactical vehicle.   Improvements include, but are not limited to, new engineering change proposals (ECPs), field safety issues and theater endorsed requirements that make it essential to keep up with the increased weight and minimize the impact to mobility on the basic vehicle.  FSOV develops, integrates and tests Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems in order to reduce space and power claim on vehicles and develop safety and engineering improvements that specifically address the enemy\u2019s changing tactics on the battlefield which typically focuses on survivability, force protection, or mobility.  Specific efforts include but are not limited to: Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) Medium Version 1.1 effort which provides for a medium vehicle variant capable of meeting specific requirements of internal aircraft transport on the C\/MH-47.  The effort also provides for engineering costs related to performance, endurance, safety testing, integration and logistical analysis of product samples.  Additionally, efforts include ECPs associated with the Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle (NSCV), the Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV).  These ECPs will address any identified safety, reliability, and performance concerns.  Finally, funding will be used to support vehicle signature reduction efforts."

The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:\n\n\u2022   Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS):  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development of one Engineering Developmental Model (EDM) to replace the SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) system.  The EDM is being developed due to obsolescence of the SDV system.  This project will utilize mature technologies, which include electric propulsion along with upgraded navigation, communication, and sensor suites.  It also provides for integration efforts with the current Dry Deck Shelter (DDS), development of engineering changes for SWCS production craft configuration, and integration of other diving technologies to meet SOF requirements.  \n\n\u2022  Dry Combat Submersible (DCS): This sub-project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development efforts for a surface-launched, dry, diver lock-in\/lock-out vessel capable of inserting and extracting SOF and\/or payloads into denied areas.  USSOCOM awarded an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in FY 2016 to produce one production representative vessel, with options to produce two additional vessels.   USSOCOM is testing one submersible prototype to validate test, commercial classification, and SOCOM safety certification processes and will continue to use the prototype to evaluate capability enhancing technologies and reduce risk in the DCS program.\n\n\u2022   DDS Modernization:  This sub-project provides for the pre-planned product improvements, testing, and integration of specialized underwater systems to meet the unique requirements of SOF, and compatibility with the submarine fleet.  The current DDS is a certified diving system which attaches to modified host submarines that provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms.  Funding supports product improvements to the current DDS, as well as associated diver equipment for in-service submarine support systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, and follow on development efforts for future SOF payloads.\n\n\u2022   SOF Combat Diving:  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, development, and transition of SOF peculiar diving equipment providing the SOF combat diver the ability to engage the enemy and conduct operations.  SOF Combat Diving will provide capabilities to USSOCOM components and will support the SDV, SWCS, and DCS in conduct of infiltration\/extraction, material recovery, underwater ship attack, beach clearance, and other missions.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, commercial and developmental life support, maneuverability, employment of weapons, diver navigational accuracy and situational awareness, thermal protection, and underwater communications."

This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:\n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Medium Mk 1 (CCM):  This sub-project is a semi-enclosed, low-observable, multi-mission combatant craft for platoon-size maritime mobility in maritime denied environments.  It is multi-mission capable, including Maritime Interdiction, Insert \/ Extract, and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) Operations.  CCM is Naval Special Warfare\u2019s (NSW) craft-of-choice for long-range, high-payload SOF mobility operations in denied environments up to high threat.  CCM has NSW\u2019s best Iron Triangle: 40 knot (kt) speed; 4 crew + 19 passengers (pax) \/ 10,000 pound (lb) payload; and 600 nautical miles (nm) range.  CCM Mk 1 payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 60 feet long, CCM is C-17 \/ C5 transportable and can launch\/recover by well deck or shore based trailer.  \n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH):  This sub-project represents a family of solutions that provides platoon-size maritime surface mobility.  The current CCH is the Sea, Air, Land Insertion, Observation, and Neutralization (SEALION) craft.  SEALION is a fully-enclosed, climate-controlled, low-observable, semi-submersible craft that operates in denied environments up to high-threat. SEALION is NSW\u2019s most versatile and survivable combatant craft and the craft-of-choice for sensitive maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and those missions requiring a prolonged presence in denied environments.  Its clandestine mobility capability is only exceeded by an undersea craft.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 7 crew + 12 pax \/ 3,300 lb payload; and 400 nm range.  SEALION payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 77+ feet long, SEALION is C-17\/C-5 transportable and can launch\/recover by well deck or shore based mobile travel lift or crane.  \n\n\u2022   Next Generation Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (NG CCFLIR):  The CCFLIR capability provides SOF with a multi-sensor, electro-optic system that enhances SOF effectiveness by improving their ability to detect, recognize, identify, range, track, and highlight objects of interest in a maritime environment.  The NG CCFLIR will use technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as operational range, image fusion, net-centric data sharing, information assurance, and seamless craft and combat systems integration.\n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Mission Equipment (CCME):  This sub-project (previously Next Generation Surface Systems) provides a rapid response capability to support SOF combatant craft systems, subsystems, and their emerging requirements.  CCME provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as, but not limited to, conformal antennas, identification friend-or-foe capabilities, enhanced communications, weapon integration, software refresh, and navigation subsystems in support of future missions.  Solutions to these emerging requirements may be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), leveraged from other Government agencies , or new solutions. \n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Assault (CCA):  This sub-project is a National-to-Theater transition.  The CCA is the theater version of the High Speed Assault Craft.  The CCA is a low-observable combatant craft for squad-size maritime mobility operations in maritime denied environments.  CCA is NSW\u2019s best craft for VBSS in maritime denied environments up to and including medium threat.  It is the craft-of-choice for maritime interdiction and boarding operations because of the open deck space, maneuverability, and interoperability with an Afloat Forward Staging Base.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 3 crew + 12 pax \/ 5,000 lb payload; and 300 nm range.  At 41 feet long, CCA is air transportable by C-130 \/ C-17 \/ C-5 and can launch\/recover by crane, davit, well deck, or shore based trailer.\n\n\u2022  Threat Awareness System (TAS):  This sub-project provides SOF with an Electronic Intelligence capability for enhanced force protection of SOF in Maritime denied environments by allowing them to identify and avoid enemy detection capabilities.  TAS will utilize technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as miniaturization and marinization to enable seamless craft integration."

Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistic support.  \n\n\u2022  CCH:  SEALION I & II were transitioned from U.S. Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I & II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity.  Based on market research completed in December 2015; currently pursuing a Sole Source award for SEALION III in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I & II.\n\n\u2022  NG CCFLIR:  Completed a full and open competition in September 2015.  An Engineering Manufacturing Development contract was awarded to FLIR Systems Incorporated, which included production and sustainment options.  The NG CCFLIR will be installed on the CCM, CCH, and CCA.\n\n\u2022  CCME acquisition strategy emphasizes on spearheading Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology for successful transition into SOF Combatant Crafts. CCME accomplishes this by using the full spectrum of contracting services, using existing contracts where appropriate, and leveraging from other Government agencies including the Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&L Science & Technology. CCME focuses on developing the technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility, to then transition to the craft. The integration and procurement piece is managed by the individual Combatant Craft Program.\n\n\u2022  CCA will use various contracting and better buying power practices to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the craft\u2019s current performance envelope.\n\n\u2022  TAS will conduct market research to determine feasibility and appropriateness of conducting a full and open competition. TAS will pursue existing Government-Off-The-Shelf technology in order to reduce acquisition timeline."

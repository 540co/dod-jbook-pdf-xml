The Joint Staff no longer supports experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R-2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&E Management Support.  As a result, this line was zeroed out and the remaining requirement was realigned to Joint Staff Analytical Support, PE 0204571J, BA6."

This includes the impact of technology advances in wireless devices, modem technology, and small secure digital capabilities on warfighter command and control capabilities to match emerging requirements with near-term technology solutions.  A comprehensive Joint Task Force (JTF) environment will support the integration and operational assessment process and support cyber training, capability development and assessments, separately and in coordination with the Department of Defense Cyber Range Environment (DECRE). This is achieved by maintaining a persistent C5 laboratory environment that allows for a rapidly reconfigurable joint, coalition, and inter-agency interoperability assessments, including participation in the Coalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) which supports on-going war efforts.  In a live setting, a deployable capability allows for range instrumentation and both the collection and analysis of decision quality data for cyber and command and control operations. This objective, joint analysis provides the data and analysis from which Director, Operational Testing and Evaluation decisions are made."

These activities measure capabilities and limitations, identify shortfalls and root cause, recommend and verify solutions, and validate joint capabilities. The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Policy; Joint Doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP); integration and interoperability of capabilities. JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability, informing acquisition decisions, and ensuring that Services and Agencies field integrated and interoperable systems.  The emphasis of JFIIT efforts is the analysis of C2 information systems and supporting procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability. Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event\/venue exercises.  In FY 2016, this legacy USJFCOM PE will be consolidated along with PE 0604787J (JSIC) and PE 0607828J (JII) into a single new Joint Staff PE 0604826J \u2013 Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber Integration (JC5I).\n\nIn FY2016 this program element will be consolidated with PE 0604826J - Joint C5 (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber) Capability Development, Integration, and Interoperability Assessments."

JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the US.  It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.

JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team and provides direct support to U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues."

The development of the Secretary of Defense's \"Forces for Unified Commands\" Memorandum Assignment Tables has historically been a labor intensive staffing process conducted annually.  The automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM Data Initiative (DI) effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment, and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency, and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  The Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.  Failure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, Joint Staff (JS) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to efficiently manage force structure resources."

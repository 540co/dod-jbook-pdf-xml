The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers as networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors (including Soldier's eyes) from battlefield laser threats; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios.  The work in this project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), Program Element (PE) 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).  The networked sensing and data fusion efforts performed in this project complement efforts funded in PE 0601104A\/Project H50 (Network Sciences CTA) and PE0601104A\/Project J22 (Network Science and Technology Research Center CTA).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this area is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)\/electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. \n\nWork in this PE is complementary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground Maneuver, Soldier\/Squad and Air portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)\/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power\/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.\n\nThis project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality and Soldier portfolios.\n\nThe work in this project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork on this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

The applied research shall support the demonstration of Army-relevant sensors on flexible substrates for robust monitoring of the human state. The flexible electronics programs efforts will extend physiological monitoring beyond the single-user, fitness-focused commercial perspective by supporting the Army goal to monitor the Soldier in training environments, determine soldier unique states, apply advance modeling to optimize the team performance based on individual uniqueness, and then apply resource distribution processes in real-time.   \n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is executed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to RF communications.  In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging.  To address these challenges, efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution.

Technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), processing, and electronics.   It also includes modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness of these technologies. Research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations. This project designs, fabricates and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume\/gun flash detection. This project also investigates and improves III-V materials, semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from Groups III and V of the periodic table. In addition, this project develops algorithms for multispectral and hyperspectral functionality, which provide the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets.  The reduction of size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 and 2016 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological advantage in IR sensors for the United States. \n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Program Element (PE) is performed by the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)\/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA."

In \"nBn\" technology an electron-barrier (\u201cB\u201d) layer is placed between two negatively charged (n-type or \u201cn\u201d) conductive layers, to reduce flow of charge through the material.  The reduction in charge flow reduces the noise intrinsic to the material, thus, increasing the material\u2019s sensitivity.  The objective of the effort is to make MWIR FPAs easier and more affordable to manufacture and to enable operation at higher temperatures, resulting in more affordable sensor systems with significant reductions in SWaP of system optics, housings and cryogenic coolers. In addition, the barrier detector approach allows for very small pixel pitch (8 micron) enabling FPAs of very large format, 5000x5000 pixel, for persistent surveillance applications that were not possible prior to emergence of this barrier FPA technology."

Specific focus is on maintaining regulatory compliance while limiting future Army liability in operations and training, and maintaining resilient and adaptive ranges. Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental\/health laws and to reduce the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army-unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution, and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations. Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling, and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nTechnologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide. To develop the required technologies, this project possesses a focus on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination, and other waste streams; a focus on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation, and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing missions; a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced, and cost effective technologies or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste; and a focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond. The resultant technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.\n\nThe work in this project supports the Army Science and technology (S&T) Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This research provides the basis for tools and methods to respond to regulatory constraints, and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis of all new Army materials and chemicals. The specific results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual Army-unique chemicals and materials of concern to minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. This includes development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down. Example areas of research include genomics analysis, cutting edge nanomaterial analysis, and computational\/molecular modeling. Interim projects are used by Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammo and PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare & Sensors (IEW&S) for use in life cycle analysis, risk assessment, and cleanup. Interim products are also US Environmental Protection Agency approved criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures and establishing regulatory limits. The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits on Army lands.\n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nTechnologies developed in this project are fully coordinated and complementary to Program Element (PE) 0603728A, Project 025. \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Huntsville, AL, and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, Warren, MI."

Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations. This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs\/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization, and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions, and also supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.  \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology) and PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism, Technology Development).  \n\nWork in this PE is led, managed, or performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging threats and enables maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated with local communities.      \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver, and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.

These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.

                        "val": "This Program Element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices\/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences. Research is funded in six projects.  \n\nProject 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighter's from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials.  Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e. the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into this project. Additionally, starting in FY17 the toxic substances research efforts will move from project VB4 to project 869.\n\nProject 870 designs and refines drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic assays\/tests devices, other preventive measures for protection and treatment against naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, and life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related traumatic injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction.  Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of combat trauma casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. In FY15 and 16 this project funds both Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts. In FY17 the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts will be funded in project ET4.\n\nProject ET4, which is a restructure of efforts funded elsewhere in this Program Element, starts in FY17 and the funding for the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program moves from project 874 to project ET4. Project ET4 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics, medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post-evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. \n\nProject FH2 conducts applied research focused on sustainment of a healthy Warfighters throughout the entire deployment life cycle. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into project 869.\n\nProject VB4 includes applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate biological tests and computer simulations in clinical trials and in animal studies. The PTSD and Coagulopathy exemplars have demonstrated the power of an iterative systems biology approach and are moving projects related to objective diagnostics and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies. Development of the SysBioCube (a data analysis, management and integration system) has provided an ability for complex collaborative efforts to share, process and evaluate data using innovative technologies. These concerted refinement efforts using systems biology are showing reduction of time and funding for solutions to intractable problems of critical military importance. Starting in FY17 the toxic substances efforts will move from project VB4 to project 869. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.\n\nWork funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A and the Defense Health Program.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment and the Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio, TX; Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD."

Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1) Prevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases\n(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n \nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nWork is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories."

This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nForce Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:\n(1) Millennium Cohort Research\n(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring\n(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries\n \nPromising efforts identified in this project are further matured under Program Element 0603002A, Project FH4.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n \nWork in this project is performed by the United States Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care."

Verified the pathway(s) (through tissues\/cells) that a toxic substance exerts its effects and validated biomarkers of that effect in the rodent model."

Evaluate and model molecular data from PTSD clinical studies to further define signatures within PTSD sufferers into distinct subgroups. Further refine and establish PTSD diagnostic biomarkers, to improve therapeutic drug effectiveness and support therapeutic drug discovery. Use PTSD biomarker in animal models to verify new therapeutic drug targeting. Construct a laboratory developed test (LDT) for PTSD using commercial off-the-shelf technology, and evaluate it in selected medical treatment facilities; continue to advance tests for identification of subgroups of PTSD to aid in informing appropriate therapeutic approaches and pursue FDA approval. Begin the design of tests for future diagnostic capabilities that would permit simultaneous measurement of multiple organ specific biomarkers indicative of exposure to a toxic substance."

For coagulopathy, will complete the collection of time-course samples from trauma patients and proceed to determine the molecular effects of various clinical treatments to improve (or not) the clinical status. Will conduct data analyses of findings with chronic pain, suicidality, infection and effects of microgravity (functions as a stressor) to integrate with clinical results. Will evaluate nutritional supplements in the mouse model simulating features of PTSD in order to assess improved resolution or recovery. Will integrate clinical and multi-molecular studies of PTSD in humans to confirm a candidate panel(s) to diagnose chronic PTSD for advancement to a LDT which will be confirmed by a commercial lab; will identify three to four DoD clinical sites which will have the facilities to evaluate the LDT as a precursor for moving forward with an FDA product. Will evaluate clinical trials using standard PTSD therapy regimens to determine which aspects of PTSD are improved (or not) and to begin to associate initial status of the patients in order to inform therapeutic strategies \u2018personalized\u2019 for the individual\u2019s condition."

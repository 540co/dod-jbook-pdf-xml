It provides for the discovery and development of basic knowledge by research performers comprised from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry. This investment helps motivate the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions, advancing the body of CWMD knowledge, and improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts. These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA\u2019s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a basic research program under DoD\u2019s Chemical and Biological Defense Program. \n\nEach year, program and technical managers conduct formal assessments of the portfolio, leveraging deep S&T expertise within DTRA, as well as from the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group, independent external panel reviews, and other CWMD-focused stakeholders. This coordination facilitates unique, CWMD-relevant basic research while eliminating unintended duplication of effort in the broader defense S&T community.\n\nDescriptions of the technical areas covered in DTRA\u2019s Basic Research Initiative portfolio are provided in the R-2a exhibit."

                                                                    "val": "The Basic Research for Countering WMD project as the nation\u2019s only basic research solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) CWMD mission areas. This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world class expertise in academia, government, and industry to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA\u2019s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.  This Initiative aligns with DTRA\u2019s strategic objectives that directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense, and the broader WMD threat reduction community.  The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for Department of Defense (DoD) applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  This project solicits, coordinates, and conducts basic research aligned to five Thrust Areas.  Each Thrust Area Manager coordinates an independently reviewed portfolio of research projects selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation. \n\nThrust Area 1: Science of WMD Sensing and Recognition. This thrust area explores novel methodologies to investigate physical properties of sensitive materials as they interact with phenomena associated with WMD, such as ionizing radiation. This research provides the basis for developing capabilities to discover the presence, identity, and quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant, in turn providing the means to develop advanced forensic applications that enable detection, characterization, and attribution, particularly in post-detonation radiative environments.\n\nThrust Area 2: Network Sciences. This thrust area explores analytical, numerical, computational and other mathematical approaches to model and simulate the behavior of layered, interdependent physical networks affected by WMD. This interdisciplinary, theoretical research provides the basis for developing advanced algorithms and analytical frameworks that accurately predict and depict WMD environments by characterizing impacts and vulnerabilities, representing root causes of cascading failures, and assessing robustness, resilience, restoration, and recovery in varying degrees of disruption.\n\nThrust Area 3: Science for Protection. This thrust area employs experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to explore and understand the causal mechanisms and deleterious characteristics of ionizing radiation and the tolerance, response, and resistance characteristics of affected sensitive electronic systems and microorganisms. This research provides the basis for engineering resilient systems and technologies, offering radical improvements to the survivability and performance of mission-critical electronic equipment and personnel in hostile radiative environments.\n\nThrust Area 4: Science to Defeat WMD. Through experimentation and computational modeling and simulation, this thrust area investigates phenomena associated with penetration physics, shock propagation and turbulence dynamics, and researches novel energetic and reactive materials for defeat of targets containing WMD. This research provides the scientific foundation necessary to develop advanced solutions for: (1) accessing WMD in hardened and deeply buried infrastructure, (2) defeating (non-nuclear) targets with minimal unintended collateral effects, and (3) predicting post-detonation (non-nuclear) weapon effects.\n\nThrust Area 5: Science to Secure WMD. This thrust area leverages a wide range of scientific and mathematical disciplines to explore phenomena related to physical, biological and chemical interactions with radioactive particles and waveforms. This research provides the technical basis for development of innovative, unconventional applications to improve security oversight and control of WMD materials and facilities and to improve monitoring and surveillance systems related to arms control and nonproliferation.\n \nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 maintains the investment in basic research to keep pace with inflation. The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 balances near term operational needs with future technical developments and capabilities. Reductions to the RDT&E portfolio impacted investment in efforts with lower return on investment, lower customer demand, or that were early in the development cycle."

This effort also provides management and support of the Threat Reduction Advisory Committee.  The committee is a senior-level Federal Advisory Committee, which provides independent expert advice on CWMD to the Secretary of Defense through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense4 for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Matters.  This effort also funds the Next Generation Nuclear Professionals (NextGen) activities.  This is an outreach effort that encourages collaboration between those currently in the nuclear field and those who are considering entering that field. The effort consists of conferences, working groups, a debate series, publications, international outreach, an online presence, and a Nuclear Scholars effort.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in advanced analytics and modeling and simulation. The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in hazard and effects characterization and technology-driven WMD threat Forecasting."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both. It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities. The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials. Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project. On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.\n\nThe decrease from FY2015 to FY2016 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration. This project also supports international collaboration, user groups, and case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The Human Survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of system vulnerabilities and assessment activities from Project RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects to Project RI.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the net effect of increased investment in system vulnerability and assessment and nuclear weapons effects experimentation and decreased investment in radiation hardening nano-electronics."

The test bed facility provides structured and systematic end-to-end test event planning, preparation, management, execution, and data analysis. The test bed offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article\/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management. The facility leverages fifty years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD. Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels. This capability does not exist anywhere else within the Department of Defense (DoD) and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in test and technology support and the national test bed.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in test and technology support to revitalize DTRA\u2019s CWMD test and evaluation capability."

The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.\n\nThe portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale."

This is part of an overall Agency rebalancing of near term operational needs with future technical developments and capabilities. Other reductions were in support of Departmental efficiencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and economic assumptions. Reductions to the RDT&E portfolio impacted investment in efforts with lower return on investment, lower customer demand, or that were early in the development cycle."

The project also supports international CWMD cooperation by developing technologies and concepts suitable for foreign release.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM to Project RA-Information Sciences and Applications.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the net effect of increased investment in hazard and effects characterization and decreased investment in technical reachback."

This project supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two research areas: (1) Countering WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation Research and Development is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development\/acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; (2) USSOCOM CWMD-T Support  develops concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize operations and activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the deferment of lower priority projects until further maturation in the technology readiness level.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability. Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the relative effect of the increased investment in FY 2015 as a result of the Congressional Add for Technology Solutions Supporting Operations in Subterranean Environments.  This investment was realigned during FY 2015 from Project RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies to better reflect the nature of the investment.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities."

The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The Radiation hardened nanoelectronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nanoelectronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  The Human Survivability supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments. The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in Nuclear Surety.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in radiation hardened nanoelectronics and nuclear weapons stockpile logistics."

The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities\/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.  Note: This is a new funding line established to rapidly transition capabilities to programs of record.\n\nThe increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the transition of nuclear effects modeling applied research efforts to advanced technology development."

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts. Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge. This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets and to (2) assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack). These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the continuing investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the projected completion of the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize, and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software."

This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.\n  \nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.\n \nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to investment in research on radionuclide sampling and analytical capabilities. The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to re-phasing of program activities to FY 2018 and FY 2019."

Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrated legacy capabilities and facilitated data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provided near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between the Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.  This toolset migrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) decision support capabilities. The framework was the only operational chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) framework in the world that provided capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by international, national, state, and local authorities.  \n\nThe decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments."

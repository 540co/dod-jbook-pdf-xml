                        "val": "The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     Approve component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).\n-     Approve component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversee Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Report results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     Review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).\n-     The approval of component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Reporting results of OT&E that support BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     The review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n( IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfighting capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for those capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises,  administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E.\n\nThe Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD\u2019s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG\/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG\/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. \n\nThis program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E, JASP and JTCG\/ME programs."

                        "val": "The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).\n\nJoint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.\n\nThreat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  Threat Systems provides DOT&E assessment officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.\n\nThe Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) T&E Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure\/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), weapon system developers, and the Services.  The Center\u2019s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM\/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The Center develops unique CM\/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines effectiveness of precision guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs.  Analysis and recommendations on CM\/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&E, DASD (DT&E), and the Services.  The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM\/CCM technology and capabilities.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds."

Joint Counter Low, Slow, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), closed in April 2015, developed and tested integrated air and missile defense operator procedures in order to increase an operator\u2019s ability to detect, track, and identify low, slow, and small UASs and provide timely notification to the air defense commander. The Unmanned Aircraft Systems Airspace Integration Joint Test, closed in July 2015, developed and tested DoD UAS procedures to support effective UAS flight operations in the National Airspace System.\n\nThree new feasibility studies were conducted in FY 2015, two of which were selected to conduct joint tests.\n\nThreat Systems\n\nThreat Systems continued test planning working group participation and performed technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conducted special studies and provided current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions; continued managing intelligence \u201cdeep dives\u201d to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets; operated and maintained the modeling and simulation configuration control board for threat models and simulation used in test facilities; and continued the development and implementation of a tri-Service and Allied threat M&S roadmap to ensure infrared countermeasure systems have sufficient threat test assets. Threat Systems proposed, managed, and oversaw threat test assets funded by the Test Resource Management Center that support DOT&E-identified threat shortfalls, identified candidate threat systems from the various intelligence agencies for possible development of models for use in test and evaluation. Threat Systems also continued efforts to maintain a standard set of threat performance models.\n\nThese activities help DOT&E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\n\nThe Center completed 35 T&E activities and analyzed and reported on more than 27 different systems, with special emphasis on aircraft survivability, CM\/CCM employment, warning systems, and PGWs. Most programs supported received an independent assessment of our data\/findings and test support for their CM\/CCM evaluations. Approximately 51% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) testing; with the majority of these efforts in support of rotary wing aircraft. About 22% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on PGW, foreign systems, and other types of field testing not related to ASE. Approximately 7% of the Center\u2019s efforts were dedicated to training support, with emphasis on CM\u2013based, pre-deployment training for rotary wing units. Seventeen percent of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on internal programs to improve test capabilities and to develop test methodologies for new types of T&E activities. The Center continued to develop multiple test tools for evaluating ASE infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems and Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) systems.  In addition, the Center is improving its electronic warfare capability with the development of the high-power Portable Range Threat Simulator (HPRTS) that will provide a more comprehensive integrated ASE T&E environment.  Our support was distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities. About 3% of the Center\u2019s efforts consisted of providing subject matter expertise and other support not directly related to scheduled test activities. \n\nThe Center expanded its test capability this year.  Two additional remote launchers were brought on board and used in testing.  All three remote launchers were upgraded to handle newer missile threats, one of the new launchers is capable of firing larger format missiles.  Multi-Spectral Sea and Land Target Simulator (MSALTS) and Joint Mobile Infrared Countermeasures Test System (JMITS) were upgraded to make their signatures more realistic.  A Portable Radar Threat System was procured and began undergoing Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) assessments.  The JSIS van vehicle was completed late in FY 2015.  \n\nThe Center provided expertise to many organizations and was actively involved in the following panels: Joint Expendable Countermeasures (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&E Subcommittee, Joint Countermeasures T&E Working Group (JCMT&E WG), and JCMT&E WG Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) subgroup lead."

Threat Systems will:\n- Continue to provide intelligence support to DOT&E staff to address specific questions on threat systems affecting programs on the OSD T&E Oversight list and provide briefings and special intelligence reports when necessary.\n- Continue identifying initiatives to improve cyberspace threat representation and prediction, cyber-economic threats to DoD systems, and scalable cyberspace threat test environments that can interface with cyber test networks.\n- Continue identifying initiatives to conduct offensive cyber operations (OCO) and defensive cyber operations (DCO) without significantly impacting critical operational capabilities.\n- Continue initiatives to improve satellite and space threat representations.\n- Support the US warfighter by providing threat intelligence to ensure operational and developmental testing occurs against realistic threat representations.\n- Sustain and manage threat M&S to support test and evaluation by overseeing and coordinating intelligence community developed threat models, performing threat model anomaly resolution resolving differences from live fire testing, integrating threat models into T&E facilities and distributing performance and signature models to T&E users.\n- Manage Integrated Technical Evaluation and Analysis of Multiple Sources (ITEAMS) efforts supporting programs on the OSD Oversight T&E List by conducting intelligence \u201cdeep dives\u201d to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets.\n- Represent DOT&E at foreign material exchanges, inter-agency coordinating groups, and non-proliferation groups to raise awareness of T&E needs for foreign material, coordinate service requirements, and de-conflict and prioritize foreign material requirements for T&E.\n- Review validation reports to independently ensure that correct threat data and critical parameters are presented in the report to assess the threat representation\u2019s capabilities to replicate a real world threat system.\n- Represent DOT&E at the Intelligence Mission Data Oversight Board responsible for development, production and sharing issues affecting the intelligence data supporting weapons systems acquisition.\n- Oversee legacy DOT&E investments and continue management and oversight of legacy and new Test Resource Management Center-funded threat system investments.\n- Continue ITEAMS leading to the development of new threat systems for T&E.\n\nThese activities help DOT&E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\n\nThe Center will test, analyze, and report on more than 30 systems, with special emphasis on aircraft survivability, CM\/CCM employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs. Each program supported will receive an independent assessment of our data\/findings and test support for CM\/ CCM evaluations. The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&E enterprise, with a clear focus on Title 10 weapons systems, aircraft survivability and hostile fire initiatives. Furthermore, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM\/CCM-focused TTP development. \n\nThe Center plans to complete an Integrated Aircraft Survivability Equipment Test Methodology assessment which will help define new T&E capabilities needed to meet future program T&E requirements.   The Center will continue Improvement and Modernization (I&M) efforts to improve our T&E capabilities. The Center will continue to work with the TSWG-sponsored HSIG model. Our support will be distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.\n\nThe Center will provide expertise to many organizations and will continue to be actively involved in the following panels: JECM Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), JASP, Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&E Subcommittee, JCMT&E WG, and JCMT&E WG HFI subgroup lead.\n\n5th Generation Aerial Target (5GAT)\n\nIn FY17, the 5th Generation Aerial Target program will complete the government owned air vehicle and subsystems layout.  The program will begin tooling and parts fabrication using carbon composite manufacturing methods.  In addition, the program will begin the electronic attack equipment integration."

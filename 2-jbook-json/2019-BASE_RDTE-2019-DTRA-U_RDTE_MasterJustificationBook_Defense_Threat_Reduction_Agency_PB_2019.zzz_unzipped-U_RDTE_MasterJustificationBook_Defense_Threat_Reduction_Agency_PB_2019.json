It provides for the discovery and development of basic knowledge by research performers from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry. This investment helps motivate the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions, advancing the body of CWMD knowledge, and improving knowledge of research efforts that support nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management. These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA\u2019s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a basic research portfolio under DoD\u2019s Chemical and Biological Defense Program. \n\nEach year, program and technical managers conduct formal assessments of the portfolio, leveraging deep Science and Technology (S&T) expertise within DTRA, as well as from the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group, independent external panel reviews, and other CWMD-focused stakeholders. This coordination facilitates unique, CWMD-relevant basic research while eliminating unintended duplication of effort in the broader defense S&T community."

This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA\u2019s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.  \n\nThis project aligns with DTRA\u2019s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.  The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  \n\nThis project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD.  The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation.  Each individual research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions.  This research will enable new capabilities to: better understand the environment, threats and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and\/or dispose of WMD threats; and safeguard the force by managing consequences.  Each program manager's portfolio leverages a wide range of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, information and network sciences and focuses basic research on the CWMD mission."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities.  The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project.  On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.\n\nDTRA\u2019s Counter - Improvised Explosive Device \/ Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED\/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED\/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED\/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED\/C-sUAS) efforts."

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD strategic deterrence system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment.  This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration.  These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group.  The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects."

Understanding the threat drives a DTRA-JIDO deliberate, structured, and proactive approach to identify and validate urgent or emergent capability gaps and requirements. JIDO's continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces enables early identification and understanding of C-IED and C-IT gaps, vulnerabilities, and risks and the timely validation, resourcing, development, and delivery of C-IED and C-IT material and non-material solutions. DTRA-JIDO technical integrators embedded with deployed forces further enables rapid adjustments to solutions as the threat\u2019s adaptation evolves.\n\nDTRA provides DoD up to an 18-month \u201chead start\u201d on addressing critical warfighter gaps, and enables DoD to deliver the most technologically advanced response to improvised threats.  These capabilities are developed from previous JIDO experience and in concert with OGAs, National Labs, Academia, Private Industry, and International Partners.\n\nThis project employs Technology Outreach as well as development of modeling-and-simulation and analysis support tools to identify and validate urgent and emergent capability requirements and associated gaps.  It provides rapid acquisition and delivery of C-IED and C-IT solutions to address these requirements and gaps."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability.  Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.\n\nDTRA\u2019s Counter- Improvised Explosive Device \/ Counter - Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED\/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED\/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED\/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED\/C-sUAS) efforts."

The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs."

This effort develops and integrates sensing technologies with multi-mission Unmanned Aerial System payloads.  (2) The Countering WMD (CWMD) weapons effects effort develops modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations.  (3)  The Innovative Technologies and Engineering effort takes promising technologies discovered under fundamental and basic research and further develops them to increase the effectiveness of weapons against blast doors and other underground structures for functional defeat of Underground Facilities (UGFs), WMD, and their delivery systems."

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and to (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries."

The IED and other disruptive improvised threats represent a continuing and irregular threat for deployed U.S. and coalition forces. In order to counter the threat, a deep understanding of IED and improvised threat use and facilitation is required. This DTRA capability is enabled by an advanced information technology infrastructure, analytical software tools, deployed and embedded DTRA operations integrators and intelligence analysts, and current and integrated operational data. Supported by CONUS-based reach-back linked to the intelligence community, the inter-agency, and coalition partners, analytics, when combined with production from the Defense Intelligence Enterprise, enables more complete threat awareness and understanding by deploying and deployed US forces to support their planning and targeting. This core function also informs research and development and threat-based rapid prototyping investment decisions, guides international and interagency coordination to enable counter threat-network support, and supplements U.S. Joint Force pre-deployment training to ensure the most recent threat is understood and new counter improvised threat systems can be properly utilized.\n\nEnable DoD Responses to Improvised Weapons (JR). DTRA builds counter-IED and improvised threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners. Through a robust communities of action approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments\/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop counter IED and improvised threat solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed U.S. Joint Forces. This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire U.S. Government and its partners to garner support for counter IED and improvised threat development and delivery.\n\nEnable Rapid Capability Delivery (JC). Understanding the threat drives a DTRA deliberate, structured, and proactive approach to identify and validate urgent or emergent capability gaps and requirements. DTRA's continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces enables early identification and understanding of C-IED and C-IT gaps, vulnerabilities, and risks and the timely validation, resourcing, development, and delivery of C-IED and C-IT material and non-material solutions. DTRA technical integrators embedded with deployed forces further enables rapid adjustments to solutions as the threat\u2019s adaptation evolves."

It is an Information Technology (IT) Operations  quick-reaction capability supported by the rapid collection, fusion, and dissemination of operational-intelligence, and technology in order to enable the defeat of threat networks that employ disruptive technologies.\n\nThe JIDO advanced Mission Information Technology (MIT) capability, its software Systems Integration Lab (SIL), and embedded CCMD-direct support and reachback staff, continuously create capabilities to ingest, fuse, analyze, and present mission relevant data and information that provides immediate assistance to DoD and the whole of government. This capability, called Catapult, is a fully accredited SIPR and JWICS based analytical cloud architecture.  The Catapult architecture pulls from over more than 850 SIPR and more than 170 JWICS data sources and allows for simple and open data access, system stability, scalability, and advanced analytics.  In addition to Catapult, the MIT created another significant capability called Voltron.  Voltron provides analysts access to SIGINT data within a secure and IC-accredited software developer environment. Voltron, give analysts access to continuously new models in support of \u201cAttack the Network\u201d analysis and operations.  Voltron provides analysts access to methodologies involving multi-INT fusion in an easy to use interface. These methods are based on years of experience supporting tactical targeting environment and built in collaboration with other teams across the Intelligence Community.  There are currently more than 75 models in Voltron available to the user community.\n\nDTRA's authorities and mission have enabled a unique \u201cPath-to-Production\u201d (PTP) for mission-driven IT solutions.  This unique development environment includes an integrated Cyber Security Assessment and Authorization (A&A) process, an in-house collateral Authorizing Official (AO), a strong partnership between technologists and intelligence analysts working real-world problems, and a collaborative and innovative culture that launches practical software solutions rapidly."

DTRA\u2019s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.\n  \nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.\n \nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies."

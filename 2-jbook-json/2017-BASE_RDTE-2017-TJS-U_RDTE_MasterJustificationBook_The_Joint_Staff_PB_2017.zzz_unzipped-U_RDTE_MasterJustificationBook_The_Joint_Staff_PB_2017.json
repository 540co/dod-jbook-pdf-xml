This includes the impact of technology advances in wireless devices, modem technology, and small secure digital capabilities on warfighter command and control capabilities to match emerging requirements with near-term technology solutions.  A comprehensive Joint Task Force (JTF) environment will support the integration and operational assessment process and support cyber training, capability development and assessments, separately and in coordination with the Department of Defense Cyber Range Environment (DECRE). This is achieved by maintaining a persistent C5 laboratory environment that allows for a rapidly reconfigurable joint, coalition, and inter-agency interoperability assessments, including participation in the Coalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) which supports on-going war efforts.  In a live setting, a deployable capability allows for range instrumentation and both the collection and analysis of decision quality data for cyber and command and control operations.

These activities measure capabilities and limitations, identify shortfalls and root cause, recommend and verify solutions, and validate joint capabilities. The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Policy; Joint Doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP); integration and interoperability of capabilities. JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability, informing acquisition decisions, and ensuring that Services and Agencies field integrated and interoperable systems.  The emphasis of JFIIT efforts is the analysis of C2 information systems and supporting procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability. Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event\/venue exercises. \n\nIn FY 2016 this program element will be consolidated with PE 0604826J - Joint C5 (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber) Capability Development, Integration, and Interoperability Assessments."

Assessed Joint-coalition capabilities relevant to the Joint Mission Threads (JMTs) of Coalition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (CISR), joint fires, IAMD and Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) in order to identify interoperability gaps and integration shortfalls. Identified twelve (12) interoperability discrepancies between US systems for joint fires (limited to digitally aided fire support, DAFS) with eleven (11) findings reported to acquisition program offices and one resolved for US Army fire support systems.  Analysis results inform US Government decisions to field interoperable and integrated US-Coalition capabilities. DoD stakeholders included Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Staff , USA, and USAF; international defense stake holders include Canada (Canadian Forces Warfare Center), Denmark (Defence Command Denmark), Norway (Norwegian Battle Lab & Experimentation), Italy, France, United Kingdom, as well as NATO (NATO Communications and Information Agency).  \n\n(2)  Assessed a Mission Partner Environment (MPE) during the scheduled BOLD QUEST event; applied the recently approved MPE capabilities definition packages (CDPs) to frame current and future assessments of MPEs and provide recommendations for improved MPE operations.  Effective analysis of  MPE performance through collaboration between DoD, Inter-Agency (IA) and Coalition partners inform capabilities development and subsequent decisions on mitigating gaps and shortfalls in the MPE capability.  \n\n(3) Collected data and provided analysis on the integration of counter-UAS (C-UAS) operational architectures, operational concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in support of broader air and missile defense requirements during BLACK DART event.  Evaluated existing combatant command plans for C-UAS operations; provided qualitative\/quantitative findings with recommendations that inform the Integrated Air & Missile Defense (IAMD) roadmap.  Effective analysis of C-UAS capabilities through collaboration within JS (J6 and J8) and among broader DoD, Inter-Agency (IA) and Industry partners informs Service decisions on the mitigation of adversary UAS capabilities.  Service and combatant command stakeholders included USN, USAF, USA, NORAD\/NORTHCOM, PACOM, and CENTCOM; IA stakeholders included Department of Homeland Security; and key foreign observers included UK\/JAP\/AUS\/ROK.  Also participating were select U.S. and foreign acquisition programs (both fielded and emerging technologies). \n\n\n(4)  Identified and evaluated over ten (10) specific cyber vulnerabilities during DoD Enterprise Cyberspace Range Environment (DECRE) events; provided qualitative\/quantitative findings with recommendations to  participating programs, and Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) to enhance planning for future cyber security events.  Analysis of Joint C2 information systems and procedures, with data collected through exercise of validated DoD scenarios in an operationally relevant multi-phased event, inform DoD mitigation of cyberattacks against command and control systems.  Service and combatant command stakeholders included NORTHCOM, DOT&E and JS."

As part of the Joint Staff (JS), JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues.  JIAMDO serves as the operational community\u2019s proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD\u2019s resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations, demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures, and provides advocacy for innovative, technically mature and affordable solutions.  \n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the development of the Air and Missile Defense Prioritized List and the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System.  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and technical oversight of homeland capability solutions.      \n\nThe Homeland program transitioned to a USAF-led Program of Record across the Future Year Defense Program in the beginning of FY 2016.  JIAMDO will retain operational and requirements oversight."

JIAMDO serves as the operational community\u2019s proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD\u2019s resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations, demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures, and provides advocacy for innovative, technically mature and affordable solutions.  \n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the development of the Air and Missile Defense Prioritized List and the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System.  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and technical oversight of homeland capability solutions."

Seven Joint Concepts were initiated and will be completed in FY16:  Joint Concept for Cyberspace, Joint Concept for Preventing the Use or Transfer of WMD, Joint Concept for Human Aspects in Military Operations, Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons, Joint Concept for Robotic and Autonomous Systems, Joint Concept for Operating in the Information Environment, and Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning.  The FY15 update of the Joint Operational Access Implementation Plan was completed and approved by the CJCS in August 2015 and work has begun on the FY16 update.  An update of two key joint force development documents were initiated:  the CJCS\u2019s Capstone Concept for Joint Operations that describes the vision for how joint forces will operate in the future and guides all joint force development; and the DJ-7\u2019s Joint Operating Environment that describes military joint force challenges based on the anticipated future security environment of 2035.  An update of the CJCSI 3010 began with expected completion in FY 2016.  Twelve joint concepts were archived after extensive staffing and approval by the DJS during Phase I of a legacy concept review.  Fourteen joint concepts are under review for archiving in FY 2016 as part of Phase II of a legacy concept review.\n\nThe draft Joint Concept for Robotics and Autonomous Systems was evaluated in an analytic workshop as part of the concept development process, and produced refined ideas to shape the Department\u2019s approach to the impact of robotics and autonomous systems to Joint Warfighting over the next 20 years.\nAs a result of concept assessment of the Chairman\u2019s Capstone Concept for Joint Operations, feedback was provided to inform DoD decision making on Goldwater-Nichols Act reviews including that Senior leaders require integrated processes to develop and implement global crisis-response options, anticipate cross-CCMD challenges, assess risk, make timely resource allocation decisions, integrate special capabilities, and communicate strategic priorities.      \n\nSpecific results:\n\n- recommended re-examining above CCMD C2 measures to support global decision-making during high-demand multi-AOR crises.  This TTX also developed ways to accelerate logistics planning and improve feasibility of CCDR estimates prior to the CJCS\/SECDEF review.  \n- suggest global synchronization is impacted at two levels: (1) above CCMD through strategic guidance, authorities, resource allocation, and risk assessment; and (2) across-CCMD through access, force sharing, information sharing, and the harmonizing of actions.  This SLS deliberated the challenges in force management, pre-conflict cross-CCMD coordination, shared battle rhythms, and supported\/supporting command relationships.  \n- identified ways to integrate Defense and National Intelligence systems for more effective collection management and more agile ISR and PED resource management.  Initiatives seek improved asset awareness across the globe, better management tools, and expanded force management authorities.  IB 15-3 results provide timely information to DoD leadership as they consider changes to the Unified Command Plan (UCP) and other ways to overcome global ISR challenges.\n\nIMPACTS:  The IRON CRUCIBLE Series influences senior leaders\u2019 perspectives on global synchronization and continues to expand DoD understanding of critical requirements for global agility and global synchronization.  Event reports and writings on global agility have impacted senior Department leaders and contribute to the narrative on innovation and efficiencies in the 2015 NMS.  The Series has produced 30 recommendations for force development in the areas of policy, doctrine, and training."

As a component of the overall Joint Force Development system, concept development and implementation products or processes are highly qualitative in nature; there are few strong quantitative performance measures in proposing new operational approaches, whether a concept is achievable, or if they inform decisions on joint capabilities. The follow metrics apply to the role of Joint Concepts in the Joint Strategic Planning System:\n\nPerformance measure 1 - Identify concepts that must be developed to support defense needs and priorities. Metrics: Process is complete. Product is on time. Analysis is thorough. \n\nPerformance measure 2 \u2013 Develop Joint Concepts assigned by CJCS and General Officer Steering Committee. Metric: Central idea and principles inform leadership and capability assessments.\n\nPerformance measure 3 \u2013 Conduct assessments that support implementation of approved Joint Concepts.

The automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM Data Initiative (DI) effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment, and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency, and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  The Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.  Failure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, Joint Staff (JS) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to efficiently manage force structure resources."

The Joint Staff Operations Directorate (J3) is the functional leader for GFM Allocation and GFM Mission Applications.  Accordingly, TJS will employ a joint strategy for efficiently fulfilling Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nThe DoD must quickly transition from legacy systems that promulgate data disparity across the Defense enterprise in order to meet the National Military Objectives that have evolved from large force scenarios to operations that include small-to-full scale activities.

Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to seamlessly exchange information in a manner that keeps pace with globally changing threats to rapidly and accurately accomplish force sourcing activities to support SecDef allocation decisions.

This will satisfy the Joint Allocation IPlan guidance for mapping Enterprise Force Structure capabilities to Force-Management modeled workflows uniting both user and technical functionality. The result is incremental development of enabling technologies designed to operationalize force structure data resident in each Service Organizational Server (Service OS) and meet Interim Operational Capability (IOC). This will be accomplished by first aggregating the Service OS into a Global Laydown Service that aggregates the Service OS data, then by linking the unique organization identifier (OUID) in the aggregate service to establish the C2 relationships habitual to the Allocation process (OPCON and TACON Links). The minimum capability to establish the OUID\/UIC linkages in JOPES TPFDDs, mapped to GFM allocation information (FTN, RFF and DEPORD\/LNR), and Transportation data (TTAN\/TTN) comprises the baseline IT functionality available to the DoD Enterprise.This is foundational for the success of GFM DI Next Steps implementation writ large and includes cyber security improvements required to meet the latest Information Assurance compliance standards."

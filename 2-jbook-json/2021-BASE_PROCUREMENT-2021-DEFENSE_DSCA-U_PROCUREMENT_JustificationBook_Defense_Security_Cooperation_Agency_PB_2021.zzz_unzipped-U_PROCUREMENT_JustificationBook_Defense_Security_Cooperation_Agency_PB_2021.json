These displays are a component of a newly installed system that is paramount to the College of International Security Studies and its method of lecture presentation, video documentation, video teleconferencing and live event production. The video displays are a key component of the audiovisual system that serves to not only display important information large enough for all to see, but also relays demonstrative video and video teleconferencing from within the room and from other conference rooms. Key benefits of this lifecycle replacement are a reduction of obsolete equipment for which spare parts can no longer be procured and the introduction of LED 4K high definition displays that are virtually maintenance free and have a typical lifecycle of 8-10 years."

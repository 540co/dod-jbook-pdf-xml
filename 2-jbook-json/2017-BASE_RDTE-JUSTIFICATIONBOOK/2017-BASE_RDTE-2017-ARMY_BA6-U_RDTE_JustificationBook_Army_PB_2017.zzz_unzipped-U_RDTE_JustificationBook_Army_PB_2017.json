This program encompasses a family of rotary and fixed-wing targets; full-scale, miniature, and subscale targets; virtual targets; ancillary devices; and their control systems.  These products are required to adequately stress weapon systems undergoing test and evaluation (T&E).  In order to stress systems during T&E, aerial targets must have flight characteristics, signatures, and other performance factors that emulate the modern threat.  This program includes long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirement documents; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation process; execution of the validation process to ensure that surrogate targets adequately represent the threat; development and acquisition of surrogate and acquired targets; and continuing maintenance, storage, and development\/enhancement\/update via engineering services of the developed and acquired threat targets to ensure availability for the T&E customer.

Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.\n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services.  These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.\n\nDirector Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army\u2019s abilities to create realistic operational environments.  The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&E.  ILTE will deliver a system of systems to provide ar Real-Time Casualty Assessment and instrumentation suite (RTCA) that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments.  ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.  ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future, weapon systems in a realistic operational environment.  ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), encryption components, and integrates operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools.  These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield.  Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles.  This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), M1, M2, Stryker, and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests."

The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army critical testing data essential for the development of complex next generation technology and advanced system capabilities.  RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability.  The anticipated solution for the program requirements is a modular open architecture system consisting of four primary items: a long range radar (LRR), a medium range radar (MRR), a short range radar (SRR), and a radar operations console (ROC).  The resulting system will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, RTC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers.\n\nFY 17 Base RDT&E dollars in the amount of $26.333 million funds the development, software engineering, and testing of replacement radars.\n\nPrior development effort was funded in APE 664759 984.

The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid\/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis."

The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid\/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis."

                        "val": "The U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll\/Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (USAKA\/RTS), located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational\/demonstration\/validation tests; , USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and space experiments.  USAKA\/RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation\/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  Funding is required to maintain O&M support, while accepting moderate risk of continued degradation of USAKA\/RTS infrastructure (housing, offices, and facilities), higher future repair costs, and reduced logistical support capability.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software and CONUS based mission control center.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world providing critical intelligence data.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and AEGIS weapon systems), and NASA's space experiments."

Space and Missile Defense Command-Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC-ARSTRAT) funding is for management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and DoD missile systems for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS). RTS began its funding under Project Element 665301.DX2 in FY14. RTS is a tenant on the US Army Garrison - Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), located within the Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (Space Situational Awareness; object tracking & identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs.  Programs supported include Army Missile Defense, Air Force, and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational\/demonstration\/validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA, ionospheric studies, space debris tracking, and data collection in support of space experiments.  RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts.  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for RTS instrumentation suites and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software and CONUS based mission control center.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world providing critical intelligence data.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and AEGIS weapon systems), and NASA's space experiments.\n\nNETCOM - The Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) funds Department of Army civilian pay, manpower service contracts, supporting IT equipment, and associated costs specifically identified and measurable to plan, manage, coordinate, and execute Information Technology Services Management.  Provides Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) services in accordance with the DA PAM 25-1-1 and the Army C4IM Services List.  Provides Base Communications Support (Service 701), Visual Information (Service 702), Information Assurance (Service 703), and Automation (Service 700).  Includes the delivery of services consisting of secure and non-secure fixed voice communications, wireless voice, data and video connectivity services, and studio video conferencing services.  Provides infrastructure support, including the design, installation, and maintenance of special circuits\/systems in support of life safety\/security systems and monitoring\/control systems.  Provides Collaboration and Messaging Services including services and tools for workforce to communicate and share information.  Provides Application and Web-hosting including operation and management services required to support web and application hosting.  Provides Desktop Management Support including management and support for end-user hardware and software services and tools.  Includes Service Desk Support, Continuity of Operations, and Disaster Recovery support.\nJustification: Each of the baseline services provided with this funding are priority zero, must fund, IT utility requirements.  Not funding or reducing the programmed funding will directly impact communications and mission command at all levels on Kwajalein Atoll.\nMemorandum of Agreement (MOA) between USASMDC\/ARSTRAT and NETCOM: The 16 August 2013 signed MOA between USASMDC\/ARSTRAT and NETCOM formally transfers baseline C4IM functional Areas of Responsibility (Base Communications Support, Information Assurance, and Automation) to NETCOM.  This MOA defines the roles and responsibilities between USASMDC\/NETCOM as well as transfers all USAKA Network Enterprise Center missions, functions, support functions, and programmed resources to support execution of the baseline C4IM Services.  Above baseline services will remain an SMDC responsibility to program and support."

Experiments and projects inform the Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  Due to significant reduction in funding, beginning in FY 2015, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding will on Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) to integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.\n\nEnables TRADOC Capability Development and Integration Directorates (CDID)\/TRADOC Capability Managers (TCM) Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development to support Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT) organizational community of PEOs\/PMs supplemented manpower shortfalls to TRADOC for many years. This was necessary to ensure work affecting their materiel development programs, specifically the mandated JCIDS process necessary for Milestone acquisition AROC\/JROC decisions, was executed in a timely manner.  During POM 14-18, the EE PEG funded a strategy for ASA(ALT) to drawdown support as TRADOC received funding in a phased approach, to maintain this workforce.  The strategy has been implemented in 25% increments beginning in FY14 with TRADOC being 100% responsible in FY17.  Funding ensures TRADOC acts independently as the voice of the warfighter, the user, in complement with the materiel developer in providing total capability management including integration of all doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF)consideration for warfighting functional areas.  Provides for TRADOC serves as the lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs enabling development and deployment\/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force.  Early Synthetic Prototyping enables wargaming, experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions.  Serve as TRADOC central coordinating organization for Headquarters Department of the Army (HDA) staff support requirements related to accelerated capabilities developments.  Integrate accelerated capabilities development activities between proponent force modernization domains to include Joint\/Service coordination.  Provides Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA), which will allow TRADOC to physically integrate, assess and evaluate the network, capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. Provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) that are used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration."

Experiments inform Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  Due to significant reduction in funding, beginning in FY 2015, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding will partially funds the Army's Simulated Experiment to integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs, and Capabilities.

Experiments and projects inform the Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  Due to significant reduction in funding, beginning in FY 2015, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding will on Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) to integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.\n\nEnables TRADOC Capability Development and Integration Directorates (CDID)\/TRADOC Capability Managers (TCM) Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development to support Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT) organizational community of PEOs\/PMs supplemented manpower shortfalls to TRADOC for many years. This was necessary to ensure work affecting their materiel development programs, specifically the mandated JCIDS process necessary for Milestone acquisition AROC\/JROC decisions, was executed in a timely manner.  During POM 14-18, the EE PEG funded a strategy for ASA(ALT) to drawdown support as TRADOC received funding in a phased approach, to maintain this workforce.  The strategy has been implemented in 25% increments beginning in FY14 with TRADOC being 100% responsible in FY17.  Funding ensures TRADOC acts independently as the voice of the warfighter, the user, in complement with the materiel developer in providing total capability management including integration of all doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF)consideration for warfighting functional areas.  Provides for TRADOC serves as the lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs enabling development and deployment\/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force.  Early Synthetic Prototyping enables wargaming, experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions.  Serve as TRADOC central coordinating organization for Headquarters Department of the Army (HDA) staff support requirements related to accelerated capabilities developments.  Integrate accelerated capabilities development activities between proponent force modernization domains to include Joint\/Service coordination.  Provides Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA), which will allow TRADOC to physically integrate, assess and evaluate the network, capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army.

Resources provided by this project operate seven elements of the DOD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB):  White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) Fort Greely, Alaska and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations. This project also funds the Army's test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. \n\nThis project finances the overhead (institutional) test operating costs not billable to DOD test customers per DODI 3200.18 and DODFMR 7000.14-R, which include recurring test infrastructure\/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization\/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances. The test capabilities at these ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.\n\nBeginning in FY17, this project will fund labor for physical security civilian guards and equipment, as well as the UH-60 helicopters. The UH-60 is part of the Aviation Restructure Initiative endorsed by the SECDEF.  \n\nThis project sustains the T&E capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies. Types of systems scheduled for testing include: Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Mission Command Network, and Tactical Command, Control, and Communication.\n\nSpecific systems supported in FY16 with continued support in FY17 include: Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Rifleman Radio, Joint Assault Bridge, Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T Inc 2\/3), AN\/TPQ53 Radar, Distributed Common Ground Sensor - Army (DCGS-A), missile defense (PAC-3), Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD), Nett Warrior, XM25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE), Gray Eagle, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Soldier Protective System M829E4, 120MM Advanced Kinetic Energy, Precision Guidance Kit (PGK), Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radios (MNVR).\n\nDirect costs are borne by materiel developers in accordance with DoD Directive 3200.11 and DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14R."

Resources provided by this project operate seven elements of the DOD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB):  White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) Fort Greely, Alaska and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations. This project also funds the Army's test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. \n\nThis project finances the overhead (institutional) test operating costs not billable to DOD test customers per DODI 3200.18 and DODFMR 7000.14-R, which include recurring test infrastructure\/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization\/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances. The test capabilities at these ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.\n\nBeginning in FY17, this project will fund labor for physical security civilian guards and equipment, as well as the UH-60 aircraft. The UH-60 is part of the Aviation Restructure Initiative endorsed by the SECDEF.    \n\nThis project sustains the T&E capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies. Types of systems scheduled for testing include: Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Mission Command Network, and Tactical Command, Control, and Communication.\n\nSpecific systems supported in FY16 with continued support in FY17 include: Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Rifleman Radio, Joint Assault Bridge, Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T Inc 2\/3), AN\/TPQ53 Radar, Distributed Common Ground Sensor - Army (DCGS-A), missile defense (PAC-3), Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD), Nett Warrior, XM25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE), Gray Eagle, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Soldier Protective System M829E4, 120MM Advanced Kinetic Energy, Precision Guidance Kit (PGK), Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radios (MNVR).\n\nDirect costs are borne by materiel developers in accordance with DoD Directive 3200.11 and DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14R."

Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing.  A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems, upgrades to existing radars to extend their economic life, common data collection and analysis tools, non-intrusive instrumentation to test Unmanned Ground Vehicles and sensors, high speed - high definition digital imaging systems to capture missile flight events, and automation software to improve data collection of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing."

Operational Test (OT) Instrumentation collects required data from both the systems being tested and the surrounding activities for real-time test control as well as for supporting effectiveness, survivability, and suitability analysis.  The Army's OPTEMPO has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making enhancement of live forces through simulation essential for testing in a realistic, operational environment by simulating tactical engagements, additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain.  ATEC OT Modeling, Simulation and Instrumentation (MS&I) funding is used to adapt capabilities from other organizations (including within ATEC), purchase off-the-shelf systems, and develop and sustain OT-unique simulation and instrumentation systems.  As required, the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development and integration of major simulation and instrumentation systems.  The MS&I (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding."

                        "val": "This project funds analytical products necessary for inherently-governmental Army Test & Evaluation Command\/Army Evaluation Center's (ATEC\/AEC) mission.  Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&S), the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Products concern Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command and communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.\n\nSurvivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; cybersecurity and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's Army Regulation (AR) 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the Army Test and Evaluation Command\/ Army Evaluation Center (ATEC\/AEC) and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability, to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement, and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the Headquarters\u2019 Department of the Army (HQDA) Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (G1) Human Systems Integration (HSI) program.  U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability\/lethality requirements, and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also, the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally, for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues, data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program\/production decisions.   \n \nThis project also supports cybersecurity survivability analysis of Army battle command\/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.  Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks, air defense and other systems.  In conjunction with PMs and Army intelligence agencies, analyzes technical vulnerabilities of foreign weapons, network related systems, and intelligence Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to U.S. Army EW systems.  Without the survivability products funded by this project, ATEC would not have a technically credible account of survivability issues at milestone decision points and systems could be fielded with unknown vulnerabilities leading to unnecessary US casualties.  PMs would make design choices that failed to properly optimize survivability, TRADOC would generate requirements that were not technically credible, and the Army studies process would rest on an inaccurate and inconsistent basis."

This program performs all engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations\/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems.  This program also provides management\/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management\/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support to the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEO AVN) and the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO, the Army's Special Operations Aircraft program office) in developing requirements for major development\/modification and for any future systems\/subsystems; and management of the test and evaluation process in support of the airworthiness qualification process.  The Airworthiness Certification program also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models.  Current ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification are PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems including Longbow Apache E-model; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model and; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and modified Shadow UAS.  Additionally the Airworthiness Certification program supports application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including Aircraft Survivability Equipment (e.g. Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband avionics and Tactical Radio Systems and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker.  The D092 funding profile partially funds the airworthiness certification program and therefore the effort will be limited to resourcing military use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects (e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other OSD initiatives."

Additionally the Airworthiness Certification program supports application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including Aircraft Survivability Equipment (e.g. Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband avionics and Tactical Radio Systems and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker.  The D092 funding profile partially funds the airworthiness certification program and therefore the effort will be limited to resourcing military use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects (e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other OSD initiatives."

Provides technical support to Army Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at: White Sands Test Center (WSTC) White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen  Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama;  Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This program develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army\/DoD RDT&E requirements.  It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers and replacement\/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems.  Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel\/weapons developers and project\/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R, October 1999.  This program enables more effective test scheduling and execution, and is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental and operational test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities."

                        "val": "This program element funds Department of the Army (DA) civilians at the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) to conduct responsive and effective materiel systems analysis in support of senior Army decision making for equipping the U.S. Army.  AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design, development, fielding, and sustaining of Army weapon\/materiel systems.  As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies systems performance data used in Army studies, and develops item-level performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&S).  \n\nAMSAA exercises Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) responsibility for verification, validation, and accreditation of item-level performance M&S for combat effects, including the development and maintenance of common data formats.  Similarly, AMSAA also exercises HQDA responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating and accrediting item-level performance data and M&S for combat effects and logistics.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, and probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, survivability, mobility and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost\/performance tradeoffs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons\/systems mix analyses; business case analyses and cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction, the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL).  These analyses are used by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Army Materiel Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers\/Project Managers; Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)\/Department of Defense (DoD) Leadership.  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier. \n\nAMSAA's M&S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems\/technologies for Current and Future Force efforts.  AMSAA is the Army's executive agent for the verification, validation, and accreditation of item\/system level performance models.  In this role, AMSAA assists model developers with the development and execution of verification and validation plans to ensure new models and simulations provide credible information\/results for decision making.\n\nAMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.  In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and lifecycle management.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprint, reducing life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical Physics of Failure (PoF) program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools\/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations resulting in improved reliability, reduced Operational and Support costs, and reduced logistics expenditures and footprint.  AMSAA, in conjunction with the Army Evaluation Center, has formed the Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), which is developing critical tools, methodology, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials needed to help acquisition programs to achieve their required reliability during the acquisition process.  The reliability improvements achieved for major weapon systems will translate into billions of dollars in operating and support cost savings across the life cycle.\n\nAMSAA's unique analytical capabilities are supporting the Army Evaluation Center to assess and determine the essential analytical requirements to enhance Army evaluations and reduce extensive testing.  AMSAA's support in this area improves evaluation products and result in better materiel solutions to the Warfighter.

AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design, development, fielding, and sustaining of Army weapon\/materiel systems.  As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies systems performance data used in Army studies, and develops item-level performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&S).  \n\nAMSAA exercises Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) responsibility for verification, validation, and accreditation of item-level performance M&S for combat effects, including the development and maintenance of common data formats.  Similarly, AMSAA also exercises HQDA responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating and accrediting item-level performance data and M&S for combat effects and logistics.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, and probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, survivability, mobility and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost\/performance tradeoffs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons\/systems mix analyses; business case analyses and cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction, the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL).  These analyses are used by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Army Materiel Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers\/Project Managers; Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)\/Department of Defense (DoD) Leadership.  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier. \n\nAMSAA's M&S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems\/technologies for Current and Future Force efforts.  AMSAA is the Army's executive agent for the verification, validation, and accreditation of item\/system level performance models.  In this role, AMSAA assists model developers with the development and execution of verification and validation plans to ensure new models and simulations provide credible information\/results for decision making.\n\nAMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.  In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and lifecycle management.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprint, reducing life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical Physics of Failure (PoF) program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools\/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations resulting in improved reliability, reduced Operational and Support costs, and reduced logistics expenditures and footprint.  AMSAA, in conjunction with the Army Evaluation Center, has formed the Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), which is developing critical tools, methodology, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials needed to help acquisition programs to achieve their required reliability during the acquisition process.  The reliability improvements achieved for major weapon systems will translate into billions of dollars in operating and support cost savings across the life cycle.\n\nAMSAA's unique analytical capabilities are supporting the Army Evaluation Center to assess and determine the essential analytical requirements to enhance Army evaluations and reduce extensive testing.  AMSAA's support in this area improves evaluation products and result in better materiel solutions to the Warfighter.  AMSAA assists in systems evaluations which support various Acquisition Category (ACAT) materiel system decisions, and provides quick response analyses in support of rapid initiatives for Current Operations.\n\nAs the Army's center for materiel systems analysis, AMSAA provides the technical capability to support Army and DoD decision makers throughout the entire acquisition process in responding to analytical requirements across the full spectrum of materiel.  AMSAA's unique in-house, consistent, integrated analytical capability is a critical asset that provides Army leadership with timely, independent, unbiased, reliable, and high quality analysis to support complex decisions required for Current Operations and the development of the Future Force (Long-Range Investment Requirements Analysis (LIRA), Force 2025 and beyond).

The primary aim of the program is to maximize the efficiency of research and development for force and materiel development by reducing the uncertainties associated with these threats.  The program also answers scientific and technical intelligence requirements, provides materiel for realistic testing and training, and aids in the development of countermeasures to threat systems, materiel, and technologies.  Operations have increased the amount of captured threat materiel that require immediate exploitation to develop countermeasures and force protection measures for US forces.  Acquisition and exploitation are executed according to Army Foreign Materiel Program (FMP) Plan prioritization and with the approval of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G2)."

This project finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.  These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.  \n\nOTC consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives.  The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE).  Funding is also used to support the planning, execution and reporting of Intelligence and Electronic Warfare operational testing.\n\nThis project (001) also provides funding for the Army Joint Test Element (JTE) which examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and DoD agencies mission gaps, tactics and doctrine resulting in the development of Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and assessment documents.  Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs), Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies (JFSs) and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to ATEC as the joint OTA.  The ATEC Commanding General serves as the Executive Steering Committee (ESG) member, while the Executive Director serves as the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) member.  DoDD 5010.41 provides policies and responsibilities for the JTE.  The DA G-8 is the agent for JTE for operations and DoD level Senior Advisory Council (SAC) responsibly.  Mission support also includes the support to two Joint Test Units (JTU) under the re-engineered Joint Test program.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, and Suffolk VA with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.  Additional support to Joint Tests remains a requirement until the OSD Chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM."

This program element finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.  These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.  \n\nOTC consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas.  These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives.  The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), Limited User Test (LUT), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE).  USAOTC conducts operational tests required by public law (Title 10 USC 2399) that provide significant data to the Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts.

CRG improves reliability by providing policy, guidance, standards, methods, tools, and training resulting in increased materiel\/operational availability, and initial operational testing success rates while decreasing support costs and logistics footprint.  The UBM initiative identifies vehicle improvements directly impacting Soldier survivability.\n\nAEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate, BMD Evaluation Directorate (funded by MDA), C4ISR Evaluation Directorate, Integrated Suitability & Methodology Directorate, Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate, Soldier & Support System Evaluation Directorate and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a headquarters element.  AEC receives staff services from ATEC HQ.  The primary competencies of these directorates is to evaluate effectiveness, suitability, survivability independently; determine if PM and user directed requirements are met, direct the test strategy and verify system safety."

PE 0605718A focuses on priorities 3 and 4.\n\nM&S Standards, Architectures, Networks and Environments: The consistent use of standards, architectures, networks and environments advances the goal of interoperability.  The Army coordinates with Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) partners along with industry and academia to develop\/employ standards that promote collaboration and facilitate the sharing of tools, data and information.  The Army oversees procedures and processes for the appropriate use of standards to foster common formats and increase M&S and data reuse.  The Army ensures these standards, architectures, networks and environments are readily accessible and can be reliably applied by users.\n\nM&S Tools and Simulation Technology: The Army must have credible M&S tools and data to support the full range of Army organizational missions and functional responsibilities.  M&S results that are timely and credible enhance decision making.  The Army must develop and accredit reliable M&S tools so that decision makers and senior leaders benefit from the results and thus support the continued development, integration and use of such tools.  To ensure credibility and reliability of results, M&S managers, developers and users must make the capabilities, constraints, limitations and assumptions of their M&S tools readily accessible.  PE 0605718A provides for the development and employment of tools in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making.  Moreover, these tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose in order to provide timely, credible results."

Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership.  Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues.  This program includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by DoDI 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (projects 720 and 727). This program addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers. By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the programs expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (project 729). The program includes funding for assessments in attitudes and opinions, longitudinal trends in Soldier and leader perceptions, and emerging issues to provide senior Army leaders with information on Soldiers' perceptions to inform personnel policy and program decision-making concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues (project 730).  The program includes funding for support for Army high performance computing centers (project 731).  The program includes funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process (project 733).  This program supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems (project C16).  Finally, this program funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (project C18).  Coordination of this program with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Ft.

In 1982, Congress, through the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) established the SBIR program to foster the involvement of U.S. based small businesses in federal research and development (R&D).  The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small, high-technology firms in the federal R&D endeavor and give driven businesses the opportunity to provide innovative R&D solutions in response to critical Army needs.  The STTR program expands the public\/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small business and the nation's premier nonprofit research institutions.  The most important role of the STTR program is to foster the innovation necessary to meet the nation's scientific and technological challenges in the 21st century.  The SBIR\/STTR support services include program and technical advisory support services on a broad level.  The Army SBIR\/STTR Program Management Office mission requires synergized, integrated business solutions that concentrates on small business technological advances, and eliminates redundancy in a codified and consistent method that reduces confusion and ambiguity for the thousands of small businesses that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs."

The FAST program provides Science Advisors, recruited from Army Materiel Command (AMC) headquarters and all AMC Major Subordinate Commands (MSC) to serve combatant commands and major commands worldwide.  FAST tours of duty provide significant professional growth opportunities for the Army's scientists and engineers and enable them to focus AMC resources on rapidly identifying and solving field technical problems that enable the improvement of readiness, safety, training, and reduce operations and support (O&S) costs.  The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers.  The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&S savings.  FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers an Annual Program Review to facilitate sharing of lessons learned between science advisors at combatant commands, assists COCOMS with their annual Science and Technology Conferences.  FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office).FAST supports warfighters in contingency operations with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Materiel Command (AMC), Redstone Arsenal, AL Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

It provides a coordinated tri-service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  It provides for Joint munition effectiveness manuals used by all services; development of standardization agreements (STANAGS) and associated Manuals of Proof and Inspection (MOPI); operation of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC); evaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional ammunition (F24); evaluation of useful shelf life, safety, reliability and producibility of pyrotechnic munitions; and improvement of explosives safety criteria for DOD munitions via the DOD Explosives Safety Board (857). Munitions Survivability and Logistics (297) will make Army units more survivable by applying technologies to reduce the sensitivity of munitions to unplanned stimuli (e.g. bullet impacts, fragment impacts, fast cook off, slow cook off, sympathetic detonation, shaped charge jets) and by testing and demonstrating munitions logistics system solutions that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Project 297 also supports the Army Insensitive Munitions (IM) Board's reviews.  The Army Explosives Safety Management Program (858) was established in FY01. The U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety uses the funds in this project to evaluate current explosives safety standards and develop new, scientific and risk-based standards to meet U. S. Army explosives requirements.  The Life Cycle Pilot Program (LCPP) (859) will assess production base capabilities and needs over the acquisition life cycle of various munitions and will address the producibility of ammunition including the transition to type classification and production, and the ability of the production base to cost effectively produce quality products on schedule.\n\nThe F21 Direct Fire Technology and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program funding is used to support small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. In addition, this program assures interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC)."

Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.  Loss of these munitions could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life.  This project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force."

Cost Reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP).  LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation.  In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)\/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF."

Additionally, environmental impacts of legacy propellants, explosives and metal parts will be studied. Replacement of hazardous materials such as Ammonium Perchlorate, Diphenylamine, Lead, etc. and addition of propellant anti-tubewear additives will remain a focus. This program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production ammunition to maximize munitions battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility between 52 and 39 caliber guns under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU) as well as rifled and smooth-bore mortars. Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will potentially increase FMS sales of US products to maintain domestic production and economies of scale.\n\nThis program will also identify, study, analyze and support fuzing and safe and arm devices. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities."

Funds required to support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects are included in this program element.  In addition, support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address environmental quality requirements are included under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Program.\n\nThe Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that both achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change in the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal.  It includes systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life.  It provides support to the system acquisition community, e.g., program and project managers, to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process.  The goal is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs and includes efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities and to ensure the availability of Halon 1301 to support weapon system fire suppression requirements.  \n\nThe Pollution Prevention Tech Support project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction and Airborne Lead Reduction environmental quality technology programs."

The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment has defined the functions of the ESAL project in coordination with the Army Acquisition Executive and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology).  This project provides direct support to the Army acquisition community to pursue environmental sustainability and comply with legal statutes, policies and regulations during the life cycle of Army materiel.  ESAL helps the Army achieve compliance with its weapon systems, industrial base, field and deployed activities directed by international treaties, Federal statutes, Executive Orders, Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policies and regulations."

ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, assessments and experiments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. \n\nThis project includes staff\/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information\/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range:  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC) at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of ~ 2,700 developmental tests; approximately ~70 operational events; and more than ~700 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs.  ATEC\u2019s FY15 total authorized workforce is 8,282 with a $1.8 billion program.\n\nThe Army Joint Test Element (JTE) examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and DOD agencies mission gaps, tactics and doctrine resulting in the development of Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and assessment documents.  Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs), Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies (JFSs) and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to ATEC as the joint OTA.  The ATEC Commanding General serves as the Executive Steering Committee (ESG) member, while the Executive Director serves as the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) member.  DoDD 5010.41 provides policies and responsibilities for the JTE.  The DA G-8 is the agent for JTE for operations and DOD level Senior Advisory Council (SAC) responsibly.  Mission support also includes the support to two Joint Test Units (JTU) under the re-engineered Joint Test program.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, and Suffolk VA with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.  Additional support to Joint Tests remains a requirement until the OSD Chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM.\n\nThis project does not finance test facility operations, test instrumentation or test equipment."

ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, assessments and experiments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. \n\nThis project includes staff\/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information\/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range:  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WSTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC), at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of ~ 2,700 developmental tests; approximately ~70 operational events; and more than ~700 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs. ATEC\u2019s FY15 total authorized workforce is 8,282 with a $1.8 billion program.\n\nThe Army Joint Test Element (JTE) examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and DOD agencies mission gaps, tactics and doctrine resulting in the development of Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and assessment documents.  Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs), Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies (JFSs) and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to ATEC as the joint OTA.  The ATEC Commanding General serves as the Executive Steering Committee (ESG) member, while the Executive Director serves as the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) member.  DoDD 5010.41 provides policies and responsibilities for the JTE.  The DA G-8 is the agent for JTE for operations and DOD level Senior Advisory Council (SAC) responsibly.  Mission support also includes the support to two Joint Test Units (JTU) under the re-engineered Joint Test program.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, and Suffolk VA with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.  Additional support to Joint Tests remains a requirement until the OSD Chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM."

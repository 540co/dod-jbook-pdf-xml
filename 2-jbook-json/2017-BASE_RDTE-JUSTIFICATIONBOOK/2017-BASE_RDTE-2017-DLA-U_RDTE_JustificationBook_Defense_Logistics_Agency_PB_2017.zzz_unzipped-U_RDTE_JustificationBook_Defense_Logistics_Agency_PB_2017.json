                        "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters\u2019 needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  \n\nBeginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  \n\u2022\tThe Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  \n\u2022\tMaintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. \n\u2022\tThe Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.    \n\nOver the FY 17- FY 21 Planning Period, $9.606M per year was realigned within the ManTech PE, from the DLA Log R&D PE (0603712S) and DLA Procurement Defense-Wide Fund.  These funds will address critical shortfalls in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes and Maintaining Viable Supply Sources.  The largest requirement was in the Maintaining Viable Supply Sources to develop a long-term, reliable source of linear microcircuits.  These devices are critical to maintaining the readiness of front line weapon system electronics.  High priority requirements in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA included additional funding for battery technology, castings and forging manufacturing technology."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  \n\nThis SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Subsistence Network, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  \n\nThe Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nThe 'Subsistence Supply Chain' which consists of the supply chain for military subsistence including combat rations, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and 'market fresh.'  The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) Program is a Manufacturing Technology Program and is the successor to the CORANET R&D program. SUBNET will form a community of practice to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies.\n\nThe Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.

These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler."

SUBNET plans to improve process capabilities by identifying targets for product, automation and business operation changes, and implementing solutions in the Subsistence Supply Chain to produce such improvements as shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead cost, and improved quality. The STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as return on investment where applicable to ensure that all SUBNET STPs are fully documented, all projects have the potential for implementation in industry; and all projects address a specific DoD\/DLA need.  \n\nThe Castings program will receive a significant increase in funding starting in FY17 to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR 17 process. Projects identified will investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter.  Contracts will be competitively awarded in FY17.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success.\n\nThe Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.\n\nThe Battery Network funding will be applied to pursue additional projects including production readiness of lithium conformable soldier batteries, military ground vehicle batteries, and aviation batteries; manufacturing transition of legacy and obsolete lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries to advanced lithium-ion batteries; and battery manufacturing automation and optimization technologies. These projects will address pressing supply chain issues by migrating from declining manufacturing to a high growth industrial base, and will achieve cost reduction by optimizing the manufacturing design, assembly, and test processes.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.\n\nFY 16 \u2013 FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust."

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as \u201cnon-procurable.\u201d This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  \n\nThe Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM\/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD\u2019s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  \n\nThe Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements."

MAE will also complete development and transition Advanced Schottky TTL Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA\u2019s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also continue development of additional emulation capabilities including TTL-Compatible CMOS. MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of a 1 million gate Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and 512K Read-Only and Random-Access Memory Emulation Capabilities. It will complete prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.\n\nStrategic Materials: A request for white paper proposals was recently added to DLA\u2019s Emerging R&D Requirements BAA for critical initial manufacturing technology requirements in domestic high strength carbon fibers.  Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.  Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials.

This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.\n\nThe MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a \u201cknowledge-based approach\u201d to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.\n\nThe DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   \n\nThe Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models."

DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate \u2013 including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLAs Research and Development (R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources and applying most effective business processes. The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs than would be otherwise attainable. The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits. \n\nIn December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&D program in support of the agency\u2019s efforts to achieve its mission. As a result, the R&D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs). The SFAs will support DLA\u2019s efforts to make the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness rates in a constrained budget environment. \n\nThe three Strategic Focus Areas were renamed in FY 17-FY 21 to more clearly capture their focus and scope:  \n\n1. Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (formerly Analytic and Decision Support): R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.\n2. Improving Logistics Processes (formerly Logistics Processes): R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n3. Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements (formerly Innovative Products and Services for Customers): R&D Efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  The SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes."

This realignment was needed to accommodate high priority requirements within DLA to improve the industrial base that supports critical weapon systems. In FY17, $4.646M was realigned from LOG R&D to MANTECH for these high priority requirements. \n\nThe consequences to the realignment include: The Medical On-Demand Business Analytics (ODBA) capability will be delayed depriving DLA end-users the ability to easily access and navigate the data from a single interface without requiring the knowledge of database access language (SQL). The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available. Modeling and Simulation tools will not be available for DLA to optimize operations and logistics processes."

Substantial cost reductions and improved performance are being realized.  Transition to other Aviation weapon systems is on hold until DLA J6 resources are available to move forward with the implementation of the SIO automated workflow. The FINISIM, Returns and Peak\/Next Gen enhancements projects were completed and transition efforts started by J343.  Peak\/Next Gen is being used to set inventory levels for more than 500,000  items, and continues to allow PLFAs to meet stringent Material Availability goals.  A project was initiated to improve the accuracy of PLT estimates which will improve support to warfighters and reduce overstocking. A project was initiated to pilot the use of Vendor Owned Inventory, a commercial practice known to reduce costs through more effective inventory management. A new project will develop techniques to link parts in indentured bills of materials to Service maintenance and parts usage data, and use modeling and simulation to provide a better estimate of demand for those parts.  A Weapon System Demand Mapping project was established to link sales, orders and requisition information to the weapon system the ordered items are used on, which will enable improved collaboration among DLA, its suppliers and its customers. Collaborative efforts were continued with the Planning team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards. \n\nTechnical\/Quality Process Improvements: Three new projects were started in FY 2015. Technical Data Availability will initiate an  attack on the problem of lengthy delays in determining if technical data is current by assessing Services\u2019 systems for configuration          management could be automatically accessed by EBS or some other method. As part of DLA\u2019s initiative in Additive Manufacturing\n(AM), a project was awarded to take parts from identification of applicability through final approval by the appropriate Service, which will clarify the issues associated with obtaining Service approvals and identify some approaches to resolving those issues. The Cost of Quality in Procurement project will identify and document the specific contractor\/bidder characteristics that distinguish the need for oversight, the appropriate oversight actions, and the associated cost of performing the actions. Collaborative efforts were continued with the Technical\/Quality team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards.\n\nProcurement Process Improvements: The Performance-Based Logistics (PBL) Process Improvement project provided recommendations to DLA senior leadership for how to improve DLA\u2019s use of PBL in its operations. A project was initiated to determine the issues and potential benefits of moving PBL storage and distribution functions from commercial sites to DLA Distribution Centers. A project was awarded to develop improvements to the automated bid evaluation process to reduce the number of manual reviews in order to reduce cost of DLA\u2019s operations and reduce the time to award purchase orders.  Collaborative efforts were continued with the Procurement Process Owner and his team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards."

The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems.\n\nThe Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products. The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the DLA strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available to support the nation\u2019s warfighter. The technical areas of interest is the development of Logistics Data Interoperability & Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.\n\nDLIR is working several short term projects in the area of interest. These efforts are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support."

Planning processes model and simulate item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories, acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items).  Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies.

To qualify for R&D funding, the R&D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. \nThis strategic focus area has 4 thrusts: Technical\/Quality Process Improvements, Selected Process Improvements, Medical Processes, and Distribution\/Disposition Processes.  \n\nT\/Q process improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters.  Services have engineering responsibility for most Class IX parts. Many T\/Q sub-processes involve interactions with Service engineering functions, which often are time-consuming and costly.  Other key T\/Q sub-processes are essential to the procurement function, such as analysis of parts content, source capabilities and problem resolution.\n\nSelected process improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical\/Quality (T\/Q) function. Although all DLA processes are in scope, the focus for FY 2016 is on the Procurement process, especially aspects driving internal costs and delays in awards.\n\nMedical Processes will expand work in critical mechanisms to guarantee product quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel distributed to our customers, and identify the most efficient and cost-effective means to deliver those medical products in accordance with FDA-labeled and other regulatory requirements.  \n\nDistribution and Disposition logistics processes deal with improving distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency. While numerous technologies and applications have been developed and exploited, DLA has not kept pace with the commercial industry in regards to modernizing its technology systems infrastructure, processes, or mobilizing information for personnel, customers, and processes."

Unpredictable\/extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access\/area denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information, invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success, ensure the viability of our capabilities, and implement a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes as well as the ability to effectively collaborate\/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote the effective\/efficient\/responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources."

                        "val": "The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks that include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities increases.\n\nMicroelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department\u2019s particular needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. To meet these requirements, DMEA procures commercial licenses to organically produce semiconductor technologies that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department\u2019s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source.\n\nDMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication expertise to ensure that the Department can field systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA\u2019s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions\u2014along with its unique technical perspective\u2014allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.\n\nWorking alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA\u2019s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry\u2019s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production order. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners\u2019 valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence necessary in an industry partner to ensure them that their IP is protected from potential competitors.

These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department\u2019s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department\u2019s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, and the incorporation of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands.\n\nToday\u2019s weapon systems experience extended field operations and are required to remain in service beyond planned replacement schedules, driving the need for growth in DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing many systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset."

Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical\/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities that might be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies as illustrated by the recent acquisition of IBM\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing capability by GlobalFoundries. This acquisition, caused by economic pressures, has again highlighted the fact that commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. This trend is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other areas of defense interest, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.\n\nThe Trusted Microelectronics program provides the Department with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. DMEA will focus on fostering all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted and assured microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Microelectronics access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies."

The goals of BEIS are to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports\/statements based on standardized data.  BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:\n- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.\n- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.\n- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.\n- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).\nThe BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business, four of which have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The remaining two services, Financial Reporting Services and Cash Accountability Reporting Services, will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility and will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports, as well as Treasury Reporting.  The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  These modernization efforts will complete deployment\/implementation of BEIS capabilities and will serve the Department Auditability goals and objectives."

BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems (FoS) concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database\/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD\/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components\/services: DCD\/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center."

The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRPTA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and GAO recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce.  \n\nAs a secure, end-to-end IT system, the DISS will be the authoritative source for the management, storage, and timely dissemination of and access to personnel security, HSPD-12, and suitability information and will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DOD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies.  \n\nThe DISS family of systems is comprised of two components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS).  Once fully deployed, the DISS family of systems will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System, which contains approximately six million active security clearance records and supports over 80,000 users.

The July 11, 2014 \u201cDISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum\u201d revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The  JVS Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed in FY15 Q2 and this initiated the Engineering Development phase in which the program will refine system requirements, configure the software, build functionality, conduct developmental testing, and plan for operational testing.  These activities will continue until a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) is made in Q2 FY16.\n\nThe DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities.

DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login\/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user\u2019s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document\u2019s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.\n\nDTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011."

Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.  In FY2015, DRAS 2 has it's own PE 0605090S separate from the PE referenced in this submission."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  \n\nWithin the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and  undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."

It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD\u2019s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting. As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer. Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nToday, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets. These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies. These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information. Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant. Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information. The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices. They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw\nconclusions. Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.\n\nThere is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements. The Comptroller\u2019s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.\n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress."

These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.\n\nThe DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies\u2019 financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.  The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\nThe DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.3 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).\n\nDAI supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, \u201cReform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise\u201d. DAI is also aligned to the  DOD Agency Strategic Fiscal Years 2015-2018, Goal 5: Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, Key Strategic Initiative - Improving competitiveness through accountability and efficiency and SO 5.2: Improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness. The objective of the DAI system is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data.\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)\/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay (P2P); Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Release (Rel) 1 provided an application upgrade to Oracle R12 along with (P2P) enhancements facilitating SFIS\/SLOA compliance and automated Time and Labor absence management.  Rel 2 introduced Grants Financial Management accounting and the start of a phased implementation of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) capabilities. Future capabilities will support Rel 3 Direct Treasury Disbursing and Budget Formulation as well as Rel 4 Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).\n\n\nDAI is currently implemented at 18 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 24,922 users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE 16) assertion packages.\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n\u2022\tCommon business processes and Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS and SLOA);\n\u2022\tAccess to real-time financial data transactions;\n\u2022\tSignificantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n\u2022\tEnhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; and\n\u2022\tUse of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\n\nThe DAI PMO completed the Oracle R12 application upgrade.  The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition\/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security\/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.  \n\nDLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  While the DAI PMO serves as systems integrator, niche activities; i.e. P2P, development, are contracted."

The DAI PMO completed development of Rel 1 Oracle Release 12 Upgrade providing P2P enhancements.  Automated absence management was implemented in two follow-on smaller releases: Rel 1.1 for DoD Educational Activity, Defense Acquisition University and Defense Security Cooperation Agency; and Rel 1.2 for Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Microelectronics Activity.  DAI PMO also procured new user licenses and technology software licenses. DAI was granted Authority to Operate (ATO) from the Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA). The PMO developed a Rel 2 Workforce Preparation Strategy; Rel 1 associated Analysis\/ Planning and Reporting Strategy; and a study of hardware hosting options. A plan for a Test & Development (T&D) environment at DISA DECC Mechanicsburg, PA was initiated and later discarded as the center did not have capacity. The PMO conducted Rels 1 and 2 pre- deployment planning and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) with current and prospective agencies and completed Rels 1 and 2 Systems Engineering (SE) Technical Reviews including five Rel 1 simulation mocks with the agencies.  DAI PMO was awarded DAI Inc 2 Rel 1 Interim Joint Interoperability Certification, a Rel 1 limited fielding decision by Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) April 21, 2015 and an Acquisition Program Baseline on February 8, 2015.  DAI PMO migrated all existing users and their data to the DAI Increment 2 Rel 1 production baseline on May 4, 2015.  After Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) revised the DoD\u2019s Federal Financial Management Requirements (FFMRs) in DFAS Blue Book (August 2014), DAI successfully completed an independent review of a regression test of a sample the revised basket of FFMRs (95% compliant).  Later, DAI PMO began an assessment against all 797 applicable Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) requirements (91% complete as of September 8, 2015).  DAI PMO successfully completed an independent Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) Test of Design\/Test of Effectiveness. The PMO deployed Rel 2 to existing users and to additional users within these agencies.  DCMA. DAU, DODEA and DMEA began using DAI for financial management. Also in FY15, Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) completed an operational assessment of with several using agencies.  JITC found that DAI is making satisfactory progress towards meeting Operational Effectiveness, Suitability, Interoperability, and Cybersecurity (OESIS).  For Usability, Training, Sustainment, and Auditability, users reported no major issues or discrepancies during the OA. Survey comments were generally favorable in the areas of system Usability, Training, Help Desk, Configuration Management, Audit Trails, and Business Process accomplishment. Users demonstrated interoperability through successful completion of all mission tasks in all Business Process areas. Reliability and Operational Availability metrics were favorable; however, the prevalent issue reported by users was excessive system response time.  PMO also conducted system tuning during Q1 to address this issue and reduced Rel 2 average response time from just over 5 seconds to 2.04 seconds as of December 3, 2015."

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.\n\nThe Defense Logistics Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within several DLA Elements:\n\nJ3 R&D\n- Advanced Battery Manufacturing (BATTNET): Manufacturing Improvements for DLA Lithium Batteries\n- Advanced Castings and Forgings (PRO-Fast):\n- Anti Counterfeiting:\n- Aircraft Alternative Braking System for Reduced Cost of Sustainment\n- Economically Recovering Rare Earth Materials\n- Advanced Technologies for Smart Connected Logistics\n\nJ6 R&D\n- TBD\n\nDMEA\n- TBD"

The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  \n\nBeginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  \n\u2022\tThe Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  \n\u2022\tMaintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. \n\u2022\tThe Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected."

Rations processed through MATS should offer substantial cost benefits over current retorted or thermally processed rations due to fast heating rate, high energy efficiency, increased production, reduced labor, improved quality, and a flexibility of differential heating for multi-components trays or pouches to preserve the optimal quality of individual components.  MATS will also produce products with better taste and texture, higher nutrient retention, longer shelf life, greater menu variety, and ultimately greater consumption of rations and less food waste.  \n\nSpecific technical achievements of the MRE Alternate Chemical Resistant Pouch Laminate will include evaluating various alternate sealant layers and test them for acid resistance, as well as overall performance in the MRE ration ultimately leading to the identification and production of alternate sealant layers for high acidic foods. The project will mitigate current risks in the material supply chain and establish reliable production for advanced pouch materials. Additionally, through this project the use of glass bottles for hot sauce and eliminating pouches for more viscous products such as ketchup and mustard that might not have a three-year shelf life.  \n\nSpecific technical achievements of the Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring will include achieving a level of new regulatory compliance via monitoring temperature variations in the San Joaquin, CA warehouse where subsistence is being stored and assembled into Unitized Group Rations. The results will identify a range of cost effective device solutions and storage mediation practices. The solution sets will determine shelf life (food quality and safety) degradation to ration components (pre and post assembly) and improve information to the customer.\n\nSpecific technical achievements of the Optimize Combat Rations Inspection Costs will include reducing inspection cost performed by two government agencies and ration producer through the elimination of duplicate tests for the same quality attribute that is performed.  Based on internal reviews and assessments, proposed solutions will be identified and further evaluated for optimal inspection frequencies and sample sizes in order to minimize cost while maintaining quality and safety goals. The optimized inspection methods that show the most promising strategies and solutions (biggest cost impacts) and quickest return on investment without sacrificing overall product quality for the customer will be verified.\n\nAt least 50% of the completed short-term projects will transition in 2016, and OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved."

The lead-time is up to 15 months for these items. The CDUM program concluded in October 2014, and the results have been implemented DOD wide for recruit items. Residual CDUM projects have been transitioned into the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) Program. The MUST Program was initiated in 4th quarter 2014. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain."

Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metal casting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems. The increase in funding will help develop new technology for casting suppliers, including inspection, materials, modeling, and design."

Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed, these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.  The increase in funding will help develop new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and most expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die)."

Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying\/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices."

MAE also made significant progress in the development of higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities which, when transitioned into full-scale production, will further increase DLA\u2019s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE also initiated new implementations including development of an Advanced Schottky TTL Capability. It will continue prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs"

The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&D groups, is informed of general R&D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.  Additional projects were awarded to BATTNET partners from FY12 Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF)."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  \n\nThis SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Subsistence Network, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  \n\nThe Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nThe Subsistence Supply Chain consists of military subsistence, which includes combat rations, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and market fresh products. The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is a manufacturing technology program and is the successor to the Combat Rations R&D program. SUBNET\u2019s community of practice will research and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. The desired outcomes of the current short-term projects Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate, Optimize Combat Ration Inspection Costs, and Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project  include testing of low risk, high-impact technology and process improvements that will improve the quality of individual and group combat rations, reduce cost, and provide efficiencies, then transitioning these improvements to industrial base suppliers and government suppliers.   \n\nThe Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler."

The government plans to invest up to $18 million during Fiscal Years 2016-2021 for funding research in response to this BAA.  Through the SUBNET STPs, research and development projects will be conducted and directed toward improving existing DLA processes and to improve manufacturing and delivery of combat rations and other subsistence products. Two of the STPs will be completed and transitioned in FY16. That is, the Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS) and the MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate Project. The Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS) goal is to reduce the cost of current combat ration entrees using MATS versus Retort, which is projected to be a 40% reduction in cost based on the energy savings per pouch of 50% MATS versus Retort. The cost reduction is projected to be higher when ration waste is considered as a result of poor reception of retorted ration entrees by the warfighters.  For the project optimize combat rations inspection costs, the objective is to establish an inspection system that captures the cost of quality that includes inspection of incoming material, in-process and end item inspections. The baseline for inspection was established for two retort products and one assembled meal. Analytical testing protocols have been reassessed for two products leading to a 58% reduction in cost. The combat ration shelf life temperature monitoring through data loggers provided a method to monitor the temperature distribution in the warehouse where unitized group rations are stored. The project includes tasks to develop solution sets for an optimal method of determining the rate of the shelf life degradation of rations and contents and a method to convey information to the receiver of the product at time of shipment. A 9 F degree reduction in temperature was achieved during the summer of 2015 as compared to 2014, leading to significant shelf life retention. The MRE Alternate Chemical Resistant Pouch Laminate will mitigate the risks in the material supply chain and establish reliable production for advanced pouch materials.  Investments in these projects and future short-term projects will improve quality of individual and group combat rations, reduce costs, increase production, and provide efficiencies. \n\nThe Castings consortium plan is to complete some existing projects towards the end of FY16 and into FY17. The new BAA will be released in FY16, with award(s) planned for 1st quarter FY17.  Plan to complete new welding procedures and post-weld heat treatments to restore mechanical properties of the welded areas of Eglin Steel, a high strength steel, and hence its strength and integrity.\n\nThe Forgings consortium plan is to continue working projects recently awarded in FY15.  The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014 using additional funds planned to begin in FY16.\n\nThe Battery Network plan is to identify and award new Short Term Projects (STP) with an expected duration of 18-24 months and an average annual funding of $200K-$500K. Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Battery Network will also pursue additional battery manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.  \n\nThe Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.\n\nFY 16 \u2013 FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust."

A Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&D groups will inform general R&D requirements for supply chain and technology improvement. The plan also includes awarding Phase 2 and 3 projects from DLA\u2019s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) in advanced battery manufacturing technology. \n\nThe Subsistence Network acquisition strategy is delivery orders against competitively awarded IDIQ R&D contracts via the forthcoming BAA.  The current contracts will reach the end of their base period of performance by December 2016.  A new BAA has been drafted and will be released in January 2016 with award of contracts in FY16 and FY17. A Joint Steering Group made up of government representatives from the Military Services, DLA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Center, and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center will review ongoing projects, identify new areas for investment, assess proposed projects, examine procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA and DoD subsistence needs and requirements.\n\nThe Castings involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations were completed and two contracts were awarded competitively September 2011.  The current contracts reached the end of their base period of performance on September 30, 2016.  A new BAA has been drafted and will be released in FY16 with award of contracts(s) in FY17.\n\nThe Forgings involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations were completed and a contract awarded September 2014.  \n\nThe Additive Manufacturing plan will partner with the Military Services and use organic and commercial AM parts production capabilities."

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as \u201cnon-procurable.\u201d This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  \n\nThe Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM\/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD\u2019s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  \n\nThe Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements."

This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.\n\nThe MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a \u201cknowledge-based approach\u201d to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.\n\nThe DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   \n\nThe Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models."

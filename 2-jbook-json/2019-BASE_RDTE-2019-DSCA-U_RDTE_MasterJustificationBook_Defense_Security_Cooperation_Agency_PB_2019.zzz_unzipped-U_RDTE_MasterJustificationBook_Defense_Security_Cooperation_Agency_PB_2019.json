The goal of the program is to provide a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment \u2013 characterized by the capacity of Department of Defense (DoD) institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, Partnership for Peace (PfP) and international partners, and other DoD educational institutions and communities. GlobalNET currently supports over 80,000 users. The program uses spiral methodology to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.\n\nThe GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), the DSCA, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD(P)), North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners an unclassified secure platform to share information, communicate and collaborate globally 24\/7, and supports administrative activities. It provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. POCS implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure, and provides allies and partner countries the ability to team in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program. The program supports PfP coalition Initiatives through the development of distributive collaboration tools to assist U.S.\/NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities. This support is important to achieve the interoperability\/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force. POCS additionally supports internet-based education, collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements."

The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.5 system, which contains more than 16,000 active projects (7,000 of which have been completed) valued at more than $2.3 billion, with a community of over 6,000 users. The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, manage, and evaluate projects intended to assist the COCOMs in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests."

G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). \n\nG-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines\/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.\n\nG-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in four major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY2012-FY2020."

G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and     releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF).\n\nG-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines\/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments,\nU.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.\n\nG-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in four major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY2012-FY2020."

Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G- TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2, and fair and open competition for the Release 3 contract. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards. Release 4 will be completed by a separate contract which will be competed for under fair and open competition."

Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program. The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational. Additional statistics-based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&V and Developmental tests validate system performance.

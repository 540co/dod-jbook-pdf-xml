Applying small incremental amounts of investments to DoD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives."

Small incremental co-investments with DoD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Requirements in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via broad area announcements and calls for white papers.  Sub-projects within the Special Operations Technology Demonstration effort include:  \n\n     \u2022  Rapid Exploitation of Innovative Technologies (REITS).  Beginning in FY 2012, funds were moved to PE 1160402BB, Special Operations Advanced Technology Development, to more accurately reflect the correct budget activity for projects in this subproject.  REITS provides USSOCOM the ability to identify, assess and exploit emerging innovative technologies for SOF capability deficiencies and expedite technology transitions from the laboratory to operational use.  These technologies provide new transformational capabilities and immediate operational impacts, while providing a compass for the direction of future SOF procurement.  \n\n    \u2022  REITS C4, ISR, and Sensors Capability Area.  Develop technologies that provide SOF with improved situational awareness and communications and computer resources in all environments. Develop and discover technologies offering significant improvements in areas such as: enhanced sensors; enhanced command and control architectures and solutions; information consolidation, dissemination, and coordination; improved man-machine interface; covert secure communications; and effective antenna solutions.          \n\n     \u2022  REITS Mobility, Power and Energy Capability Area.  Exploit and develop technologies to improve the performance and survivability, and reduce the detectability of SOF mobility assets.  Develop and discover technologies offering significant improvements in ground, sea, and air mobility areas such as: increased range\/operational environment; improved durability; power\/propulsion systems including new fuel sources, and reduced signature.\n\n    \u2022  REITS Warrior Systems and Bio-Medical Capability Area.  Exploit and develop technologies to increase the SOF warrior's survivability and performance.  Develop and discover technologies offering significant improvements in areas such as:  improved target identification and engagement, human identification, electro-optical vision systems, sensor fusion, human endurance, SOF medical equipment, operator safety, and improved weapons and accessories.\n\n    \u2022  Special Operations Technology Development Sub-Project:  This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.\n\n                 \u2022  Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Sub-Project:  TTL technologies are a key element in the ability of SOF to find, fix, and finish targets in overseas contingency operations (OCO).  This sub-project invests in critical science and technology efforts to improve operational capabilities for TTL high value individuals and objects in support of the OCO.  \n\n       \u2022  Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).   \n\n       \u2022  The following technology activity was added by congress in FY 2011:  \n\n       \u2022  Congressional add:  Unfunded Requirement - Increased development of multi-spectral optics which will address night vision capability gaps; concentrated on power requirements for SOF mobility platforms; and initiated efforts to address biometric and non-lethal engagement needs.

It is a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in operationally relevant environments with Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the Special Operations Special Technology Development effort include:  \n\n   \u2022  Rapid Exploitation of Innovative Technologies (REITS).  This sub-project supports both top-down and bottom-up approaches for USSOCOM Components, Theater Special Operations Commands and Special Operations Task Forces to articulate innovative technology recommendations.  Concepts, ideas, and needs will be submitted to HQ USSOCOM for review and\/or approval as appropriate.  The tenets promote speed, evolution, collaboration, and engagement between the SOF user and the technical problem solver.   Individual projects or ideas can be submitted from every echelon of command.  Initial evaluation clears new ideas for distribution to industry, academia, laboratories or SOF in-country mobile technology repair complexes that have the capability to augment or build solutions in-place.  The USSOCOM directive, \"Rapid Technology Support to Special Operations\" outlines the processes to identify, assess and exploit emerging innovative technologies for SOF in the following Capability Areas:  1) Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Sensors; 2) Mobility, Power, and Energy; 3) SOF Warrior Systems and 4) Weapons and Munitions.  Technical activities in these areas will provide new operational capabilities and will mature technologies to better shape future SOF procurements.  \n\n     \u2022 REITS C4, ISR, and Sensors Capability Area.  Exploit emerging technologies to conduct ATDs that provide SOF with robust C4 and intelligence capabilities such as, but not limited to, ensuring uninterrupted information exchange, influencing situations to support mission accomplishments, reducing an adversary's ability to use information, increasing sensory performance, improving antenna technologies, and achieving near real-time data fusion for sensor systems.  \n\n     \u2022 REITS Mobility, Power, and Energy Capability Area.

It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media & Product Selection, Distribution & Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increase the efficiency and shorten the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.

This initiative will initiate and continue development of emergent technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize MISO planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by ATDs and ACTDs to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended MISO systems, especially in denied areas; focused\/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) radio transmitters and antenna; television (TV) transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of disseminating MISO products to reach target audiences across a wide variety of media into denied areas; and technologies that automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities."

USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This project addresses the primary areas of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and target acquisition."

Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as:  SOF specific avionics; low probability of intercept\/low probability of detection (LPI\/LPD), terrain following\/terrain avoidance (TF\/TA) radar; Precision Strike Package (PSP) for MC-130W Multi-Mission Modification, AC-130H replacement aircraft, and other SOF platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation, target detection and identification technologies; digital broadcast capability; and aerial refueling.     \n\n\u2022   SOF C-130 Avionics Modifications.  Provides for development necessary to maintain current SOF-unique capabilities for SOF C-130 aircraft.  Includes the fit\/function\/interface replacement of the mission computers on the MC-130H and AC-130U aircraft due to obsolescence issues with the current AP-102 mission computer.    \n\n\u2022   EC-130J Commando Solo Upgrades.  Provides for integration of SOF-unique implementation of the C-130J block cycle upgrade as installed on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft and development of digital broadcast capabilities.  \n\n\u2022   Enhanced Situational Awareness for MC-130H.  Provides for near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection, identification, and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification.  This program is a new start in FY 2013.\n \n\u2022   PSP MC-130W Multi-Mission Modification.  Fulfills an urgent combat requirement to rapidly arm and field multi-mission precision strike platforms.  Provides an armed over-watch capability including sensors, communication systems, precision guided munitions, and a single medium-caliber gun.  An interim kit was fielded and funded under a Combat Mission Needs Statement. \n\n\u2022   PSP for SOF.  Supports systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP for later integration and installation onto host MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force for the AC-130H replacement aircraft, as well as other SOF platforms.  Missions for the AC-130H aircraft include, but are not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Air Interdiction, Armed Reconnaissance, Escort, and Force Protection - Integrated Base Defense.  PSP is modular, scalable, and platform neutral, and includes mission management, sensors, and weapons.  \n\n\u2022   C-130 Terrain Following Radar System.  Integrates a TF\/TA radar with an on-board processor to provide a multi-mode terrain following capability. This system is targeted for the MC-130J, MC-130W, and MC-130H platforms. \n\n \u2022   Acquisition Development Support.  This funding is required to support systems engineering, analysis, and integration.  Primary use of funds is to examine commonality and interoperability across systems.  Funding will be used in a multitude of avenues across systems to support cost-benefit analysis; provide additional test support; and further reduce cost, schedule, and technical risk.  As required, funds will support manpower costs for experts needed to meet certification, safety, reliability, and other requirements required by Office of the Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, as well as commitments for joint programs.  \n \n\u2022   SOF Common terrain following\/terrain avoidance (TF\/TA) (Silent Knight) Radar.

Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success."

Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.\n\n- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced automated data processing and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces.  The program consists of suites, mission planning kits and field computing devices."

Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments."

Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Counter-Proliferation Analysis and Planning System (CAPS); and Special Operations Command Research, Analysis and Threat Evaluation System (SOCRATES).  \n\nUSSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    \n\nOPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    \n\n\u2022   NSSS is a research and development rapid prototyping program which functions as HQSOCOM's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) by leveraging National Agency and Service development efforts focused on improving space-based intelligence products and communications and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units, to include geographic intelligence (GEOINT), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and Intelligence Fusion, Reporting, Dissemination and Processing.  The Research and Development (R&D) efforts pursued by NSSS are of a rapid development, fielding and deployment character and focus on USSOCOM's man-hunting mission.  Though not exclusive, they are usually adjunct support efforts to USSOCOM's existing Military Intelligence Programs (MIP), to include SOCRATES, Global Video Surveillance, Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL) , JTWS, Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF), Friendly Force Tracking, and Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN).  \n\n\u2022   JTWS is an evolutionary acquisition (EA) program that provides threat warning, force protection, enhanced situational awareness, and target identification\/acquisition information to SOF via signal intercept, direction finding and SIGINT.  JTWS will employ continuing technology updates to address the changing threat environment.  SOF SIGINT operators are globally deployed and fully embedded within Special Operations (SO) teams and aircrews in every operational environment.  This state-of-the-art technology enables SOF operators to provide critical time sensitive targeting and actionable intelligence to the operational commander during mission execution.  Intelligence derived from operations supports campaign objectives and the National Military Strategy.  This system has variants that utilize common technologies and interfaces allowing operators to task, organize, and scale equipment based on anticipated signal environments and areas of operation.  Variants will be modular; lightweight with minimal power requirements; and configurable to support body worn\/mobile or static, air, maritime and precision geo-location operations in support of all SOF missions.  Each variant, except static, will be capable of operation by a single trained operator.  The four variants are Ground SIGINT Kit (GSK) Bodyworn\/Mobile, Team Transportable GSK static, Air, Maritime, and Precision Geo-Location (Ground and Air).    \n\nABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON)  \n\n\u2022   CAPS.  Department of Defense (DoD) has a planning mission for counter-proliferation (CP) contingency operations.  CAPS has been identified by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as the standard CP planning tool set for DoD, and the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense Program has consolidated RDT&E funding at USSOCOM for overall program management. U.S. Strategic Command serves as the coordinator for CAPS production requirements and provides O&M funding.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DITRA) provides science and technology expertise and integration support to enhance CAPS capabilities.  CAPS provides tools and assessments to DoD and SOF mission planners to aid in worldwide identification and analysis of suspected weapons of mass destruction and potential targets; assesses the associated effectiveness, costs and risks of various CP options and their collateral effects; and develops alternative plans.  CAPS is a primary source of CP mission planning information for Combatant Commanders who are the principal customers.  CAPS requires ongoing development, integration and testing of leading edge technology for operational planning and processes in order to provide the best possible engineering analysis and to support consequence engineering to meet changing threats.   CAPS program funding and responsibility transfers to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for consolidation and interface with DIA's Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Analysis Cell (CWAC) beginning in FY 2014.\n\n\u2022   SOCRATES is an umbrella program that acquires and supports the network and computing infrastructure for SOF intelligence information up to and including the Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) level. SOCRATES integrates intelligence information from national, theater, Service and SOF-specific databases; provides news service and message traffic; automated imagery processing, dissemination, and archival; analyst-to-analyst electronic mail and collaborative tools; web interfaces\/search capabilities and browse-down capability to Secret web servers; and secure voice and facsimile. It provides a seamless and interoperable interface enabling SOF-unique intelligence support to mission planning and intelligence preparation of the battle space. \n\n\u2022   Classified.  Provided under separate cover.  \n\n\u2022    This project includes the following Congressional add:   \n\n\u2022    National Systems Support to SOF Single Card Solution effort was to redesign the L-band Single Card Solution (SCS) radio circuits to increase the frequency range to be compatible with USAF and Civil Aviation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) bands.  The resulting design, with further work, will be integrated into the cooperative updating identification aid for dismounted operations (CUIDADO) handset to provide ground forces the capability to respond to air-to-ground\/surface\/UAS IFF interrogations from USAF assets to establish their friendly status.  This unprecedented capability will be an advancement in preventing air-to-ground fratricides and assist in recovery\/extraction operations."

The CV-22 will provide long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas.  This is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft.  The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments.  The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support.  The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008. \nBlock 10:  Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.  \nBlock 20:  Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  Initial risk reduction and trade studies were initiated in FY 2006, and System Design and Development started in FY 2008.  FY 2011 RDT&E activities continued on Block 20 Increment 1 and 2, including Terrain Following Logic, Terrain Following less than 50 knots, Multi Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal, and Improved Crew Interface of Integrated Broadcast Service Data. Block 20 Increment 3 efforts were also initiated in FY2011, including Helmet Mounted Display and Digital Map Upgrade.  FY 2012 RDT&E activities continue and complete on Block 20 Increment 1, 2 & 3 efforts.  FY 2013 RDT&E activities continue on improvements to the Enhanced Situational Awareness package providing enhanced, correlated, fusion and display, threat response, training and simulation capabilities."

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification:  The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft.  The CV-22 will provide long range, high speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas.  This is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid prototyping.  The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support.  The Block 10 increment completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008. \nBlock 10:  Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.  \nBlock 20:  Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  Initial risk reduction and trade studies were initiated in FY 2006, and System Development and Demonstration started in FY 2008.  FY 2011 RDT&E activities continue on Block 20, initiating Block 20 Increment 3 and continuing Increment 1 and 2 efforts.  FY 2012 RDT&E activities continue on Block 20 Increment 1, 2 and 3 efforts.  FY 2013 RDT&E activities continue on improvements to the Enhanced Situational Awareness package providing enhanced, correlated, fusion and display, threat response, training and simulation capabilities."

Block 10 RDT&E funding was sent from USSOCOM to NAVAIRSYSCOM to be placed on contract with the V-22 prime contractor.  Block 10 capability is required for compliance with the Joint Operational Requirements Document and associated Milestone III Capabilities Production Document.  Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV 22."

The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.  \n\nSub-projects include:\n\n\u2022  Special Operations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE): Develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time critical.  The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution.  SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command & control.  This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan.  SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms\n\n\u2022  MC\/AC-130J Simulator (MC\/AC-130J): Conducts integration, assembly, test and checkout of SOF-unique MC-130J and AC-130J simulator development efforts modifications along with AC-130J to include all efforts of technical and functional activities associated with the design, development, and production of mating surfaces, structures, equipment, parts, materiels, and software required to assemble equipment (hardware\/software) elements into training mission equipment as a whole and not directly part of any other individual element. \n\n\u2022  Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance Silent Knight Radar Simulator (TF\/TA  SKR): This program will integrate Silent Knight Radar (SKR) into the MH-47G and MH-60 simulators.  It will design, develop, integrate, test, and field a SOF common multi-mode radar characterized by a Low Probability of Intercept, Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) capability. This program is a FY 2013 new start."

Former name was-  SOF Tanker Recapitalization.\n\nThe AC\/MC-130J program element funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, and AC-130H Spectre airframes. The 8 AC-130H Spectre airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and provide close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense.  Additional capabilities include low-light navigation and in-flight refueling as a receiver. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft."

Former name was SOF Tanker Recapitalization.\n\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique modifications to replace aging MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, and AC-130H Spectre airframes.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense.  Additional capabilities include low-light navigation and in-flight refueling as a receiver. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  USSOCOM will then employ an incremental upgrade approach to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the Air Force-provided aircraft. \n\nConducts development, integration, and testing of aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements.  Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, aircraft performance enhancements, electron warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits. Provides Precision Strike Package aircraft infrastructure development."

The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  Therefore, SOF Communications Advanced Development is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   \n\nUnited States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that C4 systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. \n\n \u2022  SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of satellite communications assemblages that includes the following subprograms:  heavy, medium, light, and Evolutionary Technology Insertions (ETI).  The SDN provides new technology for the next generation antenna capability for all systems: heavy, medium, and light.  This program consists of a family of deployable super high frequency, multi-band, satellite communications assemblages capable of supporting high-capacity, voice, data, video teleconferencing and video at all levels of classification.  ETIs include Satellite on the Move version A (float and ground variants)."

The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.   SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, and Communication (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments."

The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their war-fighting capability without degrading their mobility.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.   Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments."

SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success."

SOF often deploys as small, independent, quick reaction, foot-mobile teams independent of primary logistics support. Existing weapons and combat equipment are frequently unsuited to these conditions.  Sub-projects include:\n\n  \u2022  Family of Sniper Weapon Systems (FSWS). This program includes next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I) to current sniper systems.  Next-generation systems include two variants: a Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) as a life cycle replacement of the current .300 Winchester Magnum rifle (MK13) that is intended to provide SOF with a highly accurate weapon system capable of engaging targets at ranges equal to or better than the MK13, and an anti-materiel rifle that will pursue heavy sniper system technology to provide SOF with precision engagement capabilities on materiel targets.\n\n  \u2022  Weapons Accessories (WPNAC).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions\/capabilities) such as day scopes, clip-on night scopes, active aiming laser module, visible lights, grenade launchers, suppressors, hand grips, and close quarters battle sights. Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for Crew-served Weapons enhances all SOF weapons, by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), Clip-on Night Vision Devices (CNVD), and Family of Muzzle Breaks and Suppressors (FMBS).  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors to develop suppressors and flashhiders for select SOF weapon systems. These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator. This program was increased by FY 2001, FY 2002, FY 2004, FY 2006, FY 2007 and FY2010 Congressional Adds."

Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment and load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\u2022\tSOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) program provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system (VAS) mounts.  NOTE: In compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, resources to support ballistic protection efforts were moved from SPEAR to a separate project (S385A) beginning in FY 2012.\n\u2022\tTactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) Set provides the capability for the extraction, movement, sustainment and transportation of wounded.  The set contains a variety of medical items and equipment approved by the Food and Drug Administration to include intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, and devices that support patient management and en-route care capabilities for the far forward treatment of SOF casualties in remote and austere environments.  Research, development, testing, and evaluation efforts will be aimed at maintaining the CASEVAC Set capabilities by performing equipment upgrades and additions as obsolescence surfaces and new and enhanced equipment becomes available.  Product improvement and replacement will require: additional functional testing, air worthiness testing as applicable, miniaturization and \/or hardening, and packaging enhancements.    \n\u2022\tCounter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future improvised explosive devices threats used by terrorist networks.  NOTE: The C-IED efforts were conducted in the program element 1160408BB.  The resources for these efforts were split beginning in FY2013 to support the SOF theater force requirements."

Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions. These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\nThis budget line enhances the SPEAR program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment. Creation of a separate project for ballistic protection efforts was directed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010."

This program develops, buys prototypes, and fields operator-borne night vision devices for SOF.  These devices provide the SOF operator the ability to maneuver, conduct fire control operations, and perform surveillance and reconnaissance.  Research and Development efforts will develop, test, and evaluate prototype systems of the next generation fusion system.\n\n\u2022  These Visual Augmentation Systems will provide an all-weather, low-light capability for SOF personnel by employing a Block approach.  This Block approach produces a family of VAS systems which will utilize a variety of different sensor technologies to satisfy the capabilities defined by individual Block requirement.  Some examples of the types of sensor technologies that these systems may utilize include:  Image Intensification, Thermal, Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) and\/or multi-spectral.  To date the Target Engagement Portfolio has utilized several Block system approaches that have been fielded by the VAS program.  These VAS programs will be a developmental effort to produce and field the next generation systems for SOF personnel.  Some of the capability shortfalls identified by the SOF community are the following: (1) ability to detect, classify, and engage targets out to 800 m without the use of an infra-red illuminator; (2) ability to determine wind speed at ranges out to 500 m or greater and (3) ability to observe bullet trace at ranges of 800 m or greater."

Sub-projects include:    \n\n  \u2022  Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FSOV).  This initiative provides for product improvements in the areas of suspension, power management, armor protection and unique vehicle design for all SOF tactical vehicle configurations.  Designs must be standardized across all SOF Components that utilize a tactical vehicle.   Improvements include, but are not limited to, new engineering change proposals (ECPs), field safety issues and theater endorsed requirements that make it essential to keep up with the increased weight and minimize the impact to mobility on the basic vehicle.  Develop, integrate and test C4ISR systems in order to reduce space and power claim on vehicles.  Develop safety and engineering improvements that specifically address the enemy\u2019s changing tactics on the battlefield which typically focuses on survivability, force protection, or mobility.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n   \u2022  Medium Mobility Vehicle Version 1.1.  This effort provides for a projected multi-vendor award to acquire product samples for a medium vehicle variant capable of meeting specific requirements of internal aircraft transport on the C\/MH47.  The effort also provides for engineering costs related to performance, endurance, safety testing, integration and logistical analysis of product samples. \n   \u2022  Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle Kits.  This effort provides design, prototyping, testing and installation manual development of SOF peculiar   integration kits for multiple models of Service-common MRAPs employed by SOF.  Kits will enable SOF unique C4ISR installation and Common Remote Operator Weapons Station integration to Service-common MRAPs."

These aircraft provide aviation support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters."

Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60L\/M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts, and they must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022    A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade includes development of an integrated digital moving map, upgraded multifunctional displays, improved communication\/navigation suites, lightweight mission processor, structural upgrades, and next generation main\/tail rotor systems. This upgrade modification will increase safety margins and increase operational capabilities at higher altitude and temperature conditions.\n\n\u2022   The A\/MH-6 Improved Seat system will provide a crash-worthy ballistic protection, crash attenuation, and restraint system upgrades to prevent severe injury to Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) pilots.  The Center for Army Lessons Learned reported that over a three year period, 50 ARSOA pilots suffered serious back injuries and were grounded due to hard landings.     \n\n\u2022    Hostile Fire Indicating System (HFIS) detects, classifies, and alerts the aircrew to the presence of small caliber weapons fire for SOF MH-47\/60 platforms.  By providing detection and angle of arrival information, the HFIS will allow the aircrew to perform evasive and counter-fire actions significantly increasing the aircraft's probability of survival.  The Helicopter Survivability Task Force (HSTF) additional funds will incorporate Hostile Fire Indication in the Infrared Spectrum as well as providing sensor fusion of Infrared, Ultra-Violet, and acoustic sensors in order to reduce false alarms and increase probability of detection.  \n\n\u2022   The MH-47 Engine Automatic Re-Light (EARL) system will detect the presence of an impending or an in-progress engine flame-out event and re-establish combustion within the engine to avoid an actual engine flame-out.  EARL will recognize the event much faster than a pilot and then proceed to reignite\/restart the engine while monitoring and adjusting engine parameters including the ignition system and fuel flow scheduling.  EARL is required to address safety issues in the MH-47 fleet where engine flame-out has been cited as one of the probable causes of the loss of an MH-47G with loss of life in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\n\u2022   MH-47 Low Cost Modifications program is an effort to integrate an improved Common Rotor Blade (CRB) being developed by the Army into the MH-47G.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.   \n\n\u2022    Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared Radar (NGFLIR) develops and qualifies a laser rangefinder\/designator (LRF\/D) for the AN\/ZSQ-3 Electro Optical Sighting System (EOSS). \n\n\u2022   Reduced Optical Signature Emissions Solution (ROSES) program reduces the optical signature output of the current infrared expendable decoys for purposes of reducing Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) aircraft vulnerabilities.  This flare solution will have the capability to decoy currently fielded infrared missiles and more sophisticated emerging threats, and is an interim solution pending flare technology advancements.\n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60\/6 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  Additional funding is provided to enhance the maturity of the rotor-craft and begin software development.\n\n\u2022   Aircraft Occupant Ballistic Protection System (AOBPS) is a follow-on procurement for ship-sets of Multiple Impact Transparent Armor System (MITAS) panels that were developed with Helicopter Survivability Task Force (HSTF) FY 2010 RDT&E funds.  These components will replace panels and windows to increase aircrew and passenger safety and survivability."

NGFLIR will be installed on the MH-47\/60 and AH-6M platforms within the ARSOA fleet.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.\n\n\u2022   ROSES - This effort develops and qualifies a flare solution that discharges fewer expendables per dispense and emits less visible light to improve aircrew's ability to survive in sophisticated threat environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the ROSES to the extent possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.\n\n\u2022   DVE - This effort integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source process will be conducted for the DVE solution to the extent possible while capitalizing on Science and Technology initiatives and other Service DVE investments.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. Additional funds will be employed to begin the development of the software\/firmware for the Synthetic Vision Backbone which uses Digital Terrain Elevation Data or High Resolution digital elevation maps, Threat Data, and Blue Force Tracker combined with Q2 Electro-Optic Sighting System overlay and Silent Knight Radar or DVE sensors (not yet defined) to provide a synthetic vision scene to aid the aircrew in degraded visual environments. The Synthetic Vision Backbone is sensor agnostic, maximizing the use of a priori data with sensors used for change detection.\n\n\u2022   AOBPS -This is a follow-on procurement for shipsets of Multiple Impact Transparent Armor System panels that were developed with HSTF FY 2010 RDT&E funds.  These components will replace panels and windows to increase aircrew and passenger safety and survivability."

Also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, systems, and equipment are used by Special Operations Forces (SOF) in the conduct of infiltration\/extraction, hydrographic\/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:   \n\n\u2022   Combat Submersibles:  Includes incorporating obsolescence solutions and conducting product improvement efforts for the in-service SEAL Delivery Vehicle MK 8 and conducting technology development and engineering and manufacturing development for the follow-on combat submersibles such as the various types of shallow water combat submersibles.  The shallow water combat submersibles use an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop a family of submersibles, to include a new wet submersible capable of operating from existing Dry Deck Shelters, and more capable wet and\/or dry submersibles that will operate from future large submarine shelters\/systems and\/or surface ships.  The combat submersible sub-project leverages existing SEAL Delivery Vehicle components, develops new state-of-the-art components where appropriate, and leases or purchases commercial-off-the-shelf components and vehicles for test and evaluation and operational assessment.    \n\n\u2022   Underwater Support Systems and Equipment:  Includes conducting product improvement efforts for in-service submarine support systems such as the Dry Deck Shelters, unmanned underwater vehicles such as the Semi-autonomous Hydrographic Reconnaissance Vehicle, and diver equipment such as the Hydrographic Mapping Unit, Non-gasoline Burning Outboard Engines and Diver Propulsion Devices.   Also provides for technology development and engineering and manufacturing development, and studies and analysis for follow-on underwater systems and support equipment."

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. The MISO sub-projects funded are grouped by the level of organization they support.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022   The MISO Broadcast System consists of fixed and deployable multi-media production facilities for radio and television programming, distribution systems, and dissemination systems to provide MISO support to theater commanders. This program is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or interoperate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements. This program includes the fixed site media production center; a lightweight, deployable media production capability; a distribution system that provides a product distribution link to systems worldwide; a media system; a transit case fly-away broadcast systems that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio\/TV production systems; software defined radio and a long range broadcast system which transmits analog and digital broadcasts. The long range broadcast system will include unmanned aerial vehicle payloads, scatterable media, telephony, and Internet broadcast. MISO media displays will consist of easily transportable, state of the art, electronic media displays designed to disseminate and direct broadcast electronic messages, which will influence foreign target audiences, and will support the MISO direct broadcast mission requirements. The Special Operations Media System-B is a tactical deployable radio and television broadcast system. It is designed to act as the forward deployed broadcast platform of products. It has limited production capabilities and consists of two independent systems: a mobile radio broadcast system (AM, FM, SW) and a mobile television broadcast system (VHF, UHF) capable of receiving audio and video products for broadcasting.  Additionally, lightweight and tactical media development work stations will allow soldiers to produce MISO products in deployed locations.   \n\n\u2022  Commando Solo:  Commando Solo supports combat operations by flying broadcast missions for the purpose of broadcasting analog and digital radio and\/or television signals deep into denied territory.  These broadcasts are made from EC-130J aircraft that are equipped with high powered transmitters and large antenna arrays that operate in the 0.45 - 1,000 MHz frequency range.  The Commando Solo program acquisition strategy includes conducting engineering analyses to develop digital broadcast capabilities for the EC-130J and C-130J aircraft.  Commando SOLO will leverage development and hardware from the Fly-Away Broadcast System."

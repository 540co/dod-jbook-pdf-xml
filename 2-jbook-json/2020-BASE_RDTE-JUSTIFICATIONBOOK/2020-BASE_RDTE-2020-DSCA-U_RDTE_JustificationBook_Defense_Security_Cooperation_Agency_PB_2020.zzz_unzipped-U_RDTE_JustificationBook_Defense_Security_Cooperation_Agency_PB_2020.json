To that end, the System will support the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of security cooperation by: (1) providing enterprise-wide access to authoritative Title 10 and Title 22 data that supports Security Cooperation (SC) oversight, management, and decision-making; (2) providing automated and configurable workflow management and reporting tools; and (3) incorporating functionality that enhances users\u2019 situational awareness and ability to effectively plan. \nThe development of this System will create a common operating picture for billions of dollars of security cooperation activities and a disparate workforce of more than 18,000 people.  It will combine and standardize data and work processes for more than 20 security cooperation authorities that currently rely on dozens of different systems and business practices.  \n\nThe System will increase efficiencies in the Department by: (1) promoting standardization of data and processes to increase efficiency without compromising user requirements; (2) minimizing duplicative data entry; and (3) reducing duplication in DoD systems wherever possible."

To that end, the System will support the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of security cooperation by: (1) providing enterprise-wide access to authoritative Title 10 and Title 22 data that supports Security Cooperation (SC) oversight, management, and decision-making; (2) providing automated and configurable workflow management and reporting tools; and (3) incorporating functionality that enhances users\u2019 situational awareness and ability to effectively plan. \nThe development of this System will create a common operating picture for billions of dollars of security cooperation activities and a disparate workforce of more than 18,000 people.  It will combine and standardize data and work processes for more than 20 security cooperation authorities that currently rely on dozens of different systems and business practices.  \n\nThe System will increase efficiencies in the Department by: (1) promoting standardization of data and processes to increase efficiency without compromising user requirements; (2) minimizing duplicative data entry; and (3) reducing duplication in DoD systems wherever possible."

User stories and scenarios will be developed to support testing.  Design reviews and planning efforts of new capabilities will be very technical and required full understanding of requirements.

Further improvements will be accomplished on the Cross-Domain Solution (CDS), which will allow the transfer of data\/documents from Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) to the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet); the addition of four Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes.\n\nAn increase of $6.589M from FY2017 to FY2018 is due to the required development contract award of the fourth release, Release 4.

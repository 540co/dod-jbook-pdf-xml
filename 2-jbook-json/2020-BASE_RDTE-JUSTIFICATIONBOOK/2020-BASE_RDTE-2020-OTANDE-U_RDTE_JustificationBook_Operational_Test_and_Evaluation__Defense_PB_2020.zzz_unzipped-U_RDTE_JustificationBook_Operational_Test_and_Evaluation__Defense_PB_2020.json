                        "val": "The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     Approve component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS). \n-     Approve component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversee Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Report results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     Review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).\n-     The approval of component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Reporting results of OT&E that support BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     The review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n( IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfighting capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for those capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises,  administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

                        "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  \n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives. JLF was initiated in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets. Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command, and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to increase the affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of Tri-Service aircraft through joint coordination and development of survivability technologies, design tools and assessment methodologies.  The JASP coordinates and conducts RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability, and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) and is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E.\n\nThe Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered 50 years ago to serve as Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) focal point for munitions effectiveness information. The JTCG\/ME produces Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) that are the sole source for all Joint Service Authenticated non-nuclear weapons effectiveness data and methodology for DoD. The JMEMs are the \u201chow to\u201d manuals for putting ordnance on target and as such, directly impacts combat readiness, effectiveness, and survivability. JMEMs are used by the Warfighters in operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training; by the DoD, Joint, and Service planners in force-on-force modeling, mission area analysis, requirements studies and weapon procurement planning; and by the service acquisition community in performance assessment, analysis of alternatives and survivability enhancement studies. The JTCG\/ME continually evolves weapons effectiveness and target vulnerability data, standards, methodologies, and processes based on the strategic environment for better munitions effectiveness evaluation and support to a more lethal force. JTCG\/ME also increases efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department\u2019s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners. The JMEM requirements and development processes are driven by operational lessons learned (Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support and Freedom Sentinel), Joint Staff Data Call and the needs of Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Military Targeting Committee (MTC) guided by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5140.01, Munitions Requirements Process (MRP) - DoD Instruction (DoDI) 3000.04 and Operational Users Working Groups (OUWGs) input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. Considerable effort goes into these User forums to establish Warfighter requirements for current and future JTCG\/ME products, as well as continued training events and day-to-day support -- all with the goal of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources.\n\nThis program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E, JASP and JTCG\/ME programs."

Specifically, JTCG\/ME will support approximately 30 JWS training sessions with about 500 students. The training sessions allow users to optimize use of JWS capabilities, while providing JTCG\/ME with critical input on Warfighter use for future development. OUWGs are critical venues for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regard to needed software enhancements and capabilities in support of air\u2011to\u2011surface and surface-to-surface weaponeering. In addition, direct forward support to Combatant Commanders\/Task Forces will be provided to enable target materiel development, weaponeering, and CDE solution development. JTCG\/ME will continue to chair OUWGs, with participation from USCENTCOM, USAFRICOM, USSTRATCOM, USPACOM, USSOCOM, the Services, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Fires Center of Excellence, Service School Houses, the Marine Aviation Weapons\/Tactics Squadron, Operations Support Squadrons, Intelligence Squadrons, and numerous other operational units.\n-Facilitate coalition interoperability and information exchange forums. JTCG\/ME will deliver JWS version releases and standalone Pk Lookup tools to key coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales agreements. These deliveries increase efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department\u2019s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners, as well as improve the effectiveness of U.S. fires and targeting personnel working in combined environments. JTCG\/ME will also hold information exchange forums via information exchange agreements (IEAs) with the United  Kingdom and Republic of Korea. These exchanges facilitate collaboration on methodologies and efforts of mutual interest in the area of weapons effectiveness\/collateral damage estimation. \n-Develop and enhance processes to supply target vulnerability data to operational and acquisition communities. The JTCG\/ME conducts detailed vulnerability analysis to produce tri-service approved target vulnerability information (i.e., Target Geometric Model (TGM) development, Failure Analysis Logic Tree (FALT), Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), etc). These data are used to feed the approved vulnerability models to generate the target data used on JMEMs. In addition, acquisition programs leverage JTCG\/ME target vulnerability data to conduct detailed analysis of their new capabilities against threat targets. The leveraging of this information saves programs valuable time and resources, and ensures the acquisition community is using consistent and valid threat representation.\n-Support urgent operational needs for target vulnerability data with rapid response surrogation and development of Pk Lookup data for high priority weapons and targets. These specialized products directly assist CCMDs to meet the operational requirements of a dynamic environment as formal products are developed.\n-Continue to collect, approve, and supply weapons characteristics data and standards for the tri-service community to include soon to be fielded systems. These weapons are:  Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) II; Small Guide Munition (SGM) GBU-69; Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) GBU-39; Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM); Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System (JMEWS); Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM); and High speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM).\n-Enhance weapons characterization processes and communication through the JTCG\/ME Test Assistance Group (TAG). The TAG provides a forum that fuses science and art of weapon testing with subject matter experts from all the services and test ranges to review, adopt technologies and methods that reduce expense, time, anomalies, and expanded data collection. JTCG\/ME archives and publishes these weapon characterization standards in updates to the JTCG\/ME Weapon Test Procedures Manual (TPM) used by weapon test ranges. The TAG also facilitates partnerships and leveraging. These technologies and partnerships have the potential to reduce the number of weapon test articles required and remove labor-intensive activities from weapon testing.\n-Update and execute strategic roadmaps for underlying vulnerability and lethality models used as standards by the tri-service community to better support JWS 3.x development and Live Fire Testing and Evaluation (LFT&E). These roadmaps align JTCG\/ME funded and related tasks by other services and programs to facilitate leveraging. In addition, the roadmaps provide a tool for future investment planning to support modeling and simulation validation and resolution of capability gaps. A key roadmap component included several interconnected model sensitivity studies. The goal of these studies is to understand the range of potential model outputs, including stochastic variations in penetration and other processes, so that differences between test data and predictive models can be better understood. This will be used to guide live fire testing requirements for validation of the models for a program office's specific operational envelope. These studies will also provide data to support several model reaccreditations.\n-Develop and accredit Collateral Effects Radii (CER) Reference Tables in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01C, \u201cNo-Strike and the Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Methodology\u201d  for air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weapons, which are the basic data that support the CDE methodology. The JTCG\/ME CER tables and CDE methodology are used in every planned kinetic strike in all Areas of Responsibility Operation (AORs) to meet Commanders\u2019 intent and to minimize civilian casualties. As such, it is critical to the Warfighters\u2019 ability to meet urgent operational needs. JTCG\/ME implements the CER and CDE methodology within the DCiDE tool. DCiDE is an accredited and automated CDE tool that expedites and simplifies the CDE process. DCiDE enables JTCG\/ME to continuously support the CJCSI 3160.01 series, DCiDE was the only automated CDE tool authorized for use in the USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM AORs.\n-Maintain and support DIEE v2.1, DIEE is an enterprise targeting solution that provides both seamless planning and linkage to various mission planning systems and tools in operational units. It is a \u201cGovernment off the shelf\u201d (GOTS) product for advanced target development that integrates Target Coordinate Mensuration (TCM), Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE), Weaponeering, and data basing functions. DIEE was selected as the preferred operational solution of a 2018 Air Force Advanced Target Development (ATD) Software Fly-off based on 135 hours of hands-on time and 451 scored line items. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued guidance stating that,\u201dThe Services, Combatant Commands, and Combat Support Agencies will upload and use DIEE v2.1 for automated CDE to comply with the updated methodology and reporting requirement.\u201d DIEE v2.1 includes user requested enhancements, more advanced JWS interface for weaponeering capability, CJCSI 3160.01C compliant CER Reference Tables and DCiDE for CDE capability, and updated Common Geopositioning Services (CGS) for Precision Point Mensuration (PPM) capability.\n-Continue to develop future DIEE versions that will include CGS updates, 3-D viewer capability, direct Collateral Effects Library (CEL) interfacing, route tool user requested enhancements, battle damage assessment graphic production, and initial android tablet capabilities, while maintaining Warfighter support and future requirements through training and User forums.\n-Leverage CEL and other high fidelity techniques to deliver analysis packages for collateral damage mitigation, post-forensic, and force protect analyses packages to operational Users for high value targets in current operations (i.e., Operations Inherent Resolve, Operation Resolute Support, and Operation Freedom Sentinel). These efforts directly assist Combatant Commands to meet commander\u2019s intent and minimize collateral damage.\n-Continue the Enhanced Weaponeering and Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Program, a multi-year test program focused on enhancing and validating JTCG\/ME CDE tools. This program will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces while not increasing risk of collateral damage by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools. Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering\/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities to make their strike decision calls. FY 2019 efforts leverage seven FY 2018 testing events and multiple collaboration forums. FY 2019 tests will include four buried ordnance tests to evaluate the effects of burial and weapon class on warhead performance, crater ejecta, and collateral damage, and five building debris characterization tests. \n-Initiate the \u201cBattle Damage Assessment (BDA) of Deliberate and Dynamic Strikes\u201canalysis to directly support the solution offered by the Munition Strategic Portfolio Review to address the current state of the Department's munitions stockpile. The effort is a multi-year task to analyze ongoing strikes required to update JWS to: (1) ensure effective and efficient munition expenditure rates and (2) mitigate the stockpile stress. The analysis approach will include: (1) establishing an analytical cell to provide a detailed and usable Department-level combat assessment of past, current, and future strikes\/weapons employments, (2) establishing an archival database that captures the pre- and post-strike assessments of these engagements, in a format that will be called upon by the JWS to select strike packages with optimal and efficient munition expenditures, and (3) guiding tactics improvement for evolving environments and methodology development to improve weaponeering tools.

                        "val": "The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).\n\nJoint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  New projects are also encouraged to align their efforts to supporting the 2018 National Defense Strategy.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.\n\nThreat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  As DOT&E\u2019s agent, Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates, and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD (A&S)).  Threat Systems provides DOT&E action officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and the actual development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.\n\nThe Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) Test & Evaluation (T&E) Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure\/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), weapon system developers, and the Services. The Center\u2019s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM\/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft. The Center develops unique CM\/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines the effectiveness of precision-guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs. Analysis and recommendations on CM\/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&E, DASD (DT&E), and the Services. The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM\/CCM technology and capabilities.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds."

Survivability enables mission success. The Center expects to conduct, analyze, and report on more than 40 tests, with 31 requests for test support already under consideration or planned. Most testing will focus on aircraft survivability, with a focus on Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) and Urgent Universal Needs Statement (UUNS), warning and targeting systems, warfighter training events, and precision guided weapons. The Center will provide the programs with an independent assessment of our data\/findings for CM\/CCM evaluations. The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&E enterprise, with a clear focus on Title 10 oversight, aircraft survivability, and warfighter training events. Furthermore, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM\/CCM-focused training, tactics and procedures (TTP) development. Our support will be distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities. These activities will help to enhance and support the survivability of equipment, aircraft and personnel.  \n\nThe Center will continue to build upon Improvement and Modernization (I&M) efforts from FY 2018 to improve T&E capabilities. Specifically the emitters for the missile plume simulators will be upgraded to increase threat fidelity. The Center is undertaking the Joint Standard Instrumentation Suite (JSIS) project to collect threat signature and fly out data to improve infrared-guided threat models.  These models form the basis for a significant portion of ASE T&E.  JSIS reached initial operational capability this year to start initial data collection at threat live fire events. The JSIS full operational capability development will begin this fiscal year.\n\nIn addition, the Center supports each Service\u2019s ASE programs with its unique test equipment, which reduces duplicate T&E capabilities.  This benefit, along with the transportability of the Center\u2019s unique test equipment, provides DoD a cost savings that results in \u2018greater performance and affordability\u2019.

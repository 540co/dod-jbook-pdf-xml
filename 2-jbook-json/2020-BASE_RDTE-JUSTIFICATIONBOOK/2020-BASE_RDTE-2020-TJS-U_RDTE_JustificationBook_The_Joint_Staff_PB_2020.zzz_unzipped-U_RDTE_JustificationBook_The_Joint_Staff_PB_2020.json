As such, the Joint Staff will establish an experimentation capability to analyze and validate priority joint concept required capabilities. \n\nConcept analysis and validation will have a multi-faceted nature to meet the Chairmen\u2019s Title 10 responsibility of, \u201cidentifying new joint military capabilities based on advances in technology and concepts of operation, and recommending investments and experiments in such capabilities.\u201d Wargames will assess baseline mission and campaign level outcomes of the concepts as well as identify a tradespace of potential new capabilities. This tradespace of capabilities is further explored with quantitative models and software that identify the most efficient cost and capability tradeoffs to help meet the Title 10 responsibility of \u201cadvising the Secretary on new and alternative joint military capabilities, and alternative program recommendations and budget proposals, within projected resource levels.\u201d \n\nThe National Defense Strategy directs \u201cearly design tradeoffs in the requirements process to increase the speed of delivery.\u201d The Joint Staff approach to tradespace exploration follows that guidance by providing a cost conscious and operationally relevant prioritization tradeoff technique early in the portfolio design process. Using this rigorous prioritization approach, the capability development cycle can efficiently focus resources on more detailed experimentation of specific capabilities to inform the requirements process. The analysis from the experimentation program will be used to provide foundational evidence to directly inform the Joint Military Net Assessment (JMNA), the Chairman\u2019s Program Recommendation (CPR), and ultimately the Defense Planning Guidance for Joint Force development and design."

The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's statutory responsibility to provide \u201cbest military advice\u201d to the SECDEF and POTUS by expressing his vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20 year horizon; identifying joint force development implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The overarching goal is to enable investment decisions between near and far term. Concepts drive horizontal integration for force development across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. An intent of the Joint Concepts program is to support senior leader decisions in balancing today\u2019s requirements and future force requirements. Key deliverables include:  \n\nCapstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) that provides the Chairman's vision for the future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations. \n\nFamily of Joint Concepts, based on National Military Strategy (NMS), provides operational approaches to future challenges or opportunities with respect to Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations in order to guide current and future Joint Force development. \n\nJoint Concept Transition Plans, developed for each joint concept, document approaches for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) changes in the future Joint Force and identifies conceptual ideas that may require further exploration.  \n\nJoint Operating Environment (JOE) describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force so it can anticipate and prepare for potential conflicts. The JOE articulates the circumstances that are likely to alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. Finally, the JOE provides a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time.\n\nThe International Force Development Division\u2019s (IFDD) mission is to ensure collaboration and integration throughout the spectrum of joint force development.  This ensures both the Joint Staff, its allies, and partners can invest in initiatives and conduct interoperable and seamless operations to meet the objectives in the NMS. The Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC) is an initiative led by the United States Joint Staff, J-7, and partners with 22 countries and international organizations.  It is designed to develop and assess non-materiel force development solutions and close capability gaps within multi-national operations."

Also, the revised CCJO will identify force development implications and required capabilities to maintain U.S. competitive advantage against emerging threats out to 2035. In partnership with selected Combatant Commands and the Services, development of the Joint Operating Concepts to address strategic challenges has begun. Prospectuses were developed to initiate Supporting Joint Concepts in the areas of space, intelligence, deterrence, and operating in a CBRN environment. Study of the 2035 operating environment continues and informs understanding of military challenges associated with the common view of the future operating environment.  Work with Five Eyes (FVEY) countries is focused on developing a FVEY common view of the future operating environment culminating in a report due by the end of 2018.  Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning and the Joint Concept for Operating in the Information Environment completed development and were approved by the VCJCS.

This complex task requires technologies that provide integrated information obtained by linking force structure quantitative data (derived from the GFM organizational servers) to qualitative data of Capability, Readiness, Availability and Employment\/Location data (C.R.A.E.) resident in GFM mission applications and associated data bases. The Joint Staff is responsible for GFM allocation and will employ a strategy for efficiently providing Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nDoD must meet national military objectives that range from large force scenarios to small-scale activities. Our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic effects. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that rapidly and accurately enables force sourcing activities to support SecDef decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service\u2019s organizational server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the health and worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces. Key deliverables include incrementally developed, operationally realistic capability enhancements focused on resource-informed planning and GFM sourcing functionality required by numerous Joint Staff requirements documents.\n\nThe Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) enterprise force structure data integration efforts enables Project ORION: a Global Laydown Server and a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog along with functional applications that support a global visibility capability. This capability enhances resource-informed planning, global force management and joint deployment. Global visibility capability also supports future force integration and concept implementation needed to support timely and dynamic response to Combatant Commanders\u2019 contingency requirements. Project ORION creates a technical environment that enables rapid integration of the JOPES replacement with remaining GFM data that supports planning and execution of U.S. Military Operations. Project Orion provides operational force structure and the means to allocate and attach units. This capability is the cornerstone for fulfilling the CJCS-directed requirement to integrate force planning, support planning, and deployment planning and execution of military operations. The ORION environment supports all variants of planning and execution processes by providing portal access to authoritative data aggregated in the Global Laydown Servers and associated display of force capabilities, readiness, employment, and availability of the force. This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management."

These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n\n- Air Force JNTC\n\n- Navy JNTC\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training that improves interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and creating a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System, consisting of the Joint Theater Level Simulation and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation, provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO, and multinational partners. The joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners by continuing limited investments ensuring Joint Theater Level Simulation and Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation remain relevant providing reliable, low-cost, small footprint, distributed, and deployable joint training solutions. \n \nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based joint operations core curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training (externally funded); and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 program goals and objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment. Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard."

These capabilities enhance the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  RDT&E funding supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  The resulting capabilities enable selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command headquarter levels.  The funding increases warfighter access to semi-automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment through web-based, modular cloud capabilities. \n\nThe Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the joint force to be responsive to the warfighters\u2019 changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed joint live, virtual, and constructive enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and high interest training issues identified in the Chairman\u2019s annual training guidance."

Develop, test and deliver two JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS) releases resulting in improved cybersecurity, and a more effective and efficient online training management application that is interoperable with DoD personnel management systems.  Requirements will be derived from CCMD user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness and the Chairman\u2019s training guidance. The objectives are to provide a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit, and develop content for pre-exercise training and support (as required by the Services) and support individual and unit training for Special Purpose - Marine Air Ground Task Force missions.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and the ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~550,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by providing them global 24\/7 access to mandatory joint training as they prepare to participate in CCMD exercises and real world missions. JKO will also focus on enhancements to improve the management of individuals\u2019 training records and readiness reporting by extending information sharing and web services with DoD personnel management systems.  \n\n2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS).  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for CCMD exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations.  The SGST will be used as part of the OSD-endorsed blended learning training component in approximately eight CCMD collective training exercises to prepare individuals serving on CCMD required small functional teams and C\/JTF \"battle staffs.\"  \n\n3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing its comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile application and mobile training products. JKO\u2019s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO mobile application. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide."

                        "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a joint training environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n\n- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Interoperability Division (JID)\n\n- Marine Corps Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training to improve interoperability and create realistic tactical and operational joint training.  JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support Services and USSOCOM requirements to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training; and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment.  Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.\n\nJID: Joint Interoperability Division (JID) supports 35 annual schoolhouse interoperability courses and up to six CAPSTONE Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) courses tied to various Combatant Command (CCMD) joint exercises. JID trains CCMD, Services and partner nations' operations center personnel on interoperability planning tasks required during contingencies and exercises in emerging mission areas such as joint fires, net enabled weapons, remotely piloted aircraft, integrated air and missile defense, and contested operations including secure internet with Link-16\/TDL equipped major weapon systems and smart bombs.\n\nMarine Corps JNTC:  These funds provide USMC stability and risk reduction to a variety of ongoing joint efforts focused on improving the fidelity and realism of training simulation systems that prepare Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for deployment in support of CCMD operations.  In support of the Commandant\u2019s planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance and support of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF) Bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  It also provides a single source training environment capability enabling users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, it also enhances pattern of life and indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers' ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into training scenarios. \n\nADL: The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver training and education more efficiently and cost effectively. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. This oversight supports interagency interoperability and promotes personnel readiness, ensuring the right people receive the right training at the right time."

Based on the Commandant's planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-multi-resolution federation bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  The MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also provides a single source training environment capability that enables users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems easing the burden of requesting terrain, 3D models, and other geographic layers into a single source. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also enhances pattern of life (PoL) \/ indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers the ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into the training scenarios."

All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. \n\nThis PE provides Soldiers and Small Combat Units with the most effective personal clothing, equipment, combat rations, shelters, and logistical support items with the least weight and sustainment burden. This PE supports the maturation and demonstration of technologies associated with aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, rapid ammunition\/munitions deployability and resupply, combat rations and combat feeding equipment, combat clothing and personal equipment (including protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear), and expeditionary base camps with an emphasis on emerging operating environments and missions that require expeditionary maneuver. The Projects focus on the challenge of integrating clothing and individual equipment on the Soldier to effectively bridge the gap between humans, technology, and equipment design. The Projects in this PE adhere to Tri-Service Agreements on clothing, textiles, and food with coordination provided through the Cross-Service Warfighter Equipment Board, the Soldier as a System Integrated Concepts Development Team, and the Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board.\n\nWork in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602787A (Medical Technology), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology), PE 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0603015A (Next Generation Training and Simulation Systems), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603008A (Electronic Warfare Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.\n\nWork in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602786A (Warfighter Technology) and supports Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) operational concepts by demonstrating precision aerial delivery and airdrop from non-traditional platforms.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers, which are rapidly deployable\/re-locatable, require no Military Construction, and need limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and assesses the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under Program Element (PE) 0602786A \/ Project VT4. Demonstrated EBC equipment is transitioned to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).\n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.\n\nPromising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for human medical products, and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides). The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and\/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small group human study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct safety and effectiveness clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large pivotal trials in diverse populations will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and small safety and effectiveness studies involving humans according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA or EPA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.\n\nBlast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by: the U.S. Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD."

The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nResearch conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1)\tPrevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2)\tBacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3)\tViral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4)\tDiagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n\nResearch is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).\n\nWork is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.\n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A (Medical Systems - Adv Dev), Project 808 (DoD Drug & Vacc Ad).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY20 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by USAMRMC at Fort Detrick, MD.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases."

Studies have shown that the malaria parasite can become resistant to existing drugs, which makes it necessary to continually develop new and more effective and safe treatments. This effort selects candidate vaccines for various types of malaria, including the severe form of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (Plasmodium vivax), prepares technical data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans, and conducts testing of promising malaria vaccine candidates in humans. A malaria vaccine would minimize the progression and impact of drug resistance and eliminate the need to take preventive anti-malarial drugs."

These efforts will support initial and sustained integrated theater health care and trauma care delivery in future dispersed operations characterized by delayed evacuation, prolonged care, and reduced\/denied communications. AI and machine learning technologies developed in this Project aim to reduce military combat casualties by enabling autonomous evacuation utilizing future Army Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and ground platforms. Pursuant to these aims, this Project will research and design a tele-monitored and remote-controlled medical module to support medical resupply and casualty evacuation. The medical module will be developed to be self-contained, providing a \"roll-on, roll-off\" medical capability to future multi-purpose UAS and ground platforms.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by: the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD."

The major effort under this Project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon. SSL technology has demonstrated the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges. HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance. This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor\/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nWork is performed by the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces.\nOvercoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

Mature technologies are incorporated onto existing, Army owned UGV technology demonstrators so that performance of the enabling technologies can be evaluated.\n\nThe approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office. Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio. Ground Maneuver Portfolio investments are greatly improving logistics throughput and surge capability supporting maneuver forces (Leader Follower technology) and allow experimentation with manned and unmanned teams to develop the advantages that inform\/protect the maneuver force (Robotic Wingman JCTD).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This Project evaluates new selection measures, assignment methods, and performance metrics for individuals and units, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Work in this Project will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering  priority focus areas, the Army Vision, the Army's Talent Management Strategy, and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.

This PE matures Soldier weapons and enabling components\/subsystems, demonstrates lethal weapons systems with potential to provide greater lethality, target acquisition, fire control, and range at a significantly reduced weight for optimized Soldier and Small Unit system performance. The major focus areas for Soldier Lethality S&T are Soldier weapons and ammunition technologies, protection technologies, cognitive and physical performance measures, training in synthetic training environments, and mission support capabilities such as situational awareness sensors and displays, dismounted power and energy technologies, and Soldier and Small Unit sustainment capabilities. This technology diverse PE also matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage all targets and threats at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day\/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments), and for advancing live training technologies that accurately replicate and realistically represent the effects of current and future weapons systems during force-on-force and force-on-target training. This PE matures and demonstrates effective technology in personal combat clothing, protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear, combat rations, shelters, logistical support items for aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, and energy systems to power current and emerging Soldier-born ISR, sensor, optical, and communication systems with the least weight and sustainment burden on the Soldiers and Small Combat Units. This PE matures and demonstrates technologies supporting the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE), a single, interconnected synthetic training system that will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon \/ multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. A specific research thrust area is applying systems-based practices to mature and demonstrate scientific and tailored knowledge of Soldiers' physical and cognitive architecture to facilitate rapid and efficient designs, assessments and trade-off analyses of technology insertions on the Soldier. Significant S&T investments are directed to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes while reducing the size and weight of the form factor of the equipment. \n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602143A-Soldier Lethality Technology.\n\nAll FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in Support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command."

Efforts in this Project support early application of Human Systems Integration (HSI) by translating research findings into performance-based design criteria for use in the Army's requirements definition process and materiel acquisition process for Army Modernization. Application of this work will yield reduced workload, fewer errors, reduced task times, enhanced Soldier protection, user acceptance, and allow the Soldier to extract maximum performance from the equipment. Major efforts address Soldier cognitive load and cognitive fusion research, advanced aircraft design to include flight in degraded visual environments, and development of human performance measures and methods to address current and future human system integration challenges. Individual efforts exploit adaptive learning methods and strategies, applied methods to accelerate expertise development, integration of displays for ease of use and optimized situational awareness, and development of technical frameworks for crew automation integration in Command and Control Systems (C2). Efforts also support flight crew decision-aiding and autonomy, advanced crew station design for aircraft, full mission operations in degraded visual environments, and advanced manned-unmanned teaming concepts.\n\nResults of these efforts are transitioned to the Program Executive Offices (PEO), Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). This effort complements work done in PE 0602143A Soldier Lethality Technology, Project BC3 Soldier Decision Making & Communications Performance Technology.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

The STE will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon \/ Multi-Domain Operations, combined arms maneuver, and mission command training at the point of need anywhere in the world, increasing Soldier and Small Unit proficiency through repetition. Units can then master collective training tasks in the live environment. The Project leverages the capabilities of industry and the research and development community, to include work at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). This project matures and demonstrates a distributed modeling and simulation (M&S) environment that integrates a collection of multi-fidelity models and simulations and tools that map to an evolving architecture and M&S activities to support decisions throughout the acquisition life-cycle; and provides a unifying M&S architecture that synchronizes and integrates multi-resolution modeling applications such as Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) experimentation utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled attributes. This Project  focuses on researching cutting-edge M&S methods to enable the Army and the Department of Defense (DoD) to perform critical System of Systems (SoS) analysis, experimentation, technology tradeoffs, capability assessments, concept development, and training that saves time and resources while increasing the effectiveness of acquisition and training activities.\n\nThis effort complements work done in 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ Project BE8 (Synthetic Training Environment (STE) Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Exercises covered broader time and space conditions than are possible in live field experiments. Implemented team challenge experiments to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks for developing concepts or systems; and, based on previous year evaluations, modified analysis methodologies, structured assessments, and frameworks to improve data captured for analysis and feedback, with the goal of providing insight and data to enable risk mitigation, informing current or future acquisition programs early in the development lifecycle. Technical areas of interest included force protection, interoperability, internet of things, autonomous systems, and electronic warfare."

All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThis PE matures and demonstrates electronic warfare (EW) sensors and software intended to deny, disrupt, locate or destroy the enemy's command, control and communications (C3) systems and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. This PE matures both countermeasures (CM) and counter-countermeasures (CCM) to deny the enemy the use of their systems while protecting United States (U.S.) assets from enemy deception and jamming. Project CY3 matures and demonstrates architecture, sensor and software techniques to provide operationally relevant capabilities for cyber support at Corps level and below and enables cyber situational awareness, command and control, mission rehearsal, observable reporting, and framework to incrementally advance cyber tool development. Project K15 matures and demonstrates capabilities to locate and exploit enemy communication systems including computer networks. Project K16 matures and demonstrates multifunctional EW capabilities (jamming) to enhance platform survivability and provide near real-time situational awareness to the Commander through the detection, identification and geo-location of emitters of interest.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology), and is coordinated with PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The computational expertise and resources enable Department of Defense (DoD) personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state-of-the-art computer network technologies. The Software Application effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The effort will equip existing military ground vehicles with scalable robotic technology through the integration of modular kits, common interfaces, and a common architecture to improve inter-node supply movement. Further, the system will modernize and optimize the operations within the supply nodes to improve accountability and throughput. The objective of AGR is to integrate new and emerging technologies into the Army's sustainment system to improve throughput, accountability, and safety and provide the Warfighter with the flexibility needed to meet future needs. \n\nThe work under this Project will transition to the Leader Follower Program of Record (PoR). The architecture and safety work under this Project also lays the groundwork for the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV).\n\nThis Project matures and demonstrates simulation tools that predict autonomous vehicle performance. This Project matures and demonstrates a real-time simulator that provides the ability to design and assess ground vehicle autonomous behaviors in adverse environmental conditions, reducing the need for field testing. These simulation technologies can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command and the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center. \n\nWork is also coordinated with PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology), and transitions to PE 0604017A (Robotics Development)."

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), that provides an open architecture to allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Data collection will involve both simulation and live collection. Simulation will provide a baseline to correctly collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for improving algorithms for both formation control and unmanned aerial vehicle map input for unmanned ground vehicle mobility. Live data will start with Surrogate platforms in local areas. This will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligent methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI\/ML techniques to mature and demonstrate intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for GPS. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to improve algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI\/ML techniques to optimize intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAV mapped areas. Data collected from air vehicle will be converted to maneuverable information for unmanned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go\/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command.\n\nThis Project is coordinated with PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology)."

Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day\/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots\/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day\/night\/adverse weather conditions.\n\nWork in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).\n\nAll FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Integration of improved sensors, signal processing algorithms, and data fusion will maintain mission capabilities in DVE (e.g. smoke, dust, fog). Demonstration of scalable, multi-functional (360 degree SA, Hostile Fire Detection (HFD), Aided Driving), low cost SA systems with in-vehicle displays that can be tailored to the ground platform and mission requirements will bring timely and useful information to the vehicle crew and squad.

Project 002 demonstrates tools and methods for compliance with environmental laws relevant to conservation of natural and cultural resources while providing a flexible realistic training environment for mission activities. The Army also requires the ability to assess, establish, upgrade, and secure infrastructure while in theatre to enable deployed force operations. This project matures and demonstrates tools for robotic and autonomous agile infrastructure modification and custom designed construction for expeditionary structures on demand. Project 025 demonstrates pollution prevention tools and methods to minimize the Army's use and generation of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes. Project 03E focuses on technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and technologies to empower rapid fielding of next generation energetics, propellants and munitions.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nFY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThis PE is fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology).\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Futures Command (AFC)."

This Project will shape and protect Army investments in next generation fires by delivering proactive, scientifically sound risk and environmental impact management strategies. Efforts in this Project assess environmental factors in mission planning activities that impact the battlefield landscape of future threats while also identifying opportunities and impacts to mission success in sparse data environments. These efforts will enable mission planners to identify the industrial\/commercial resources used as components of weapons development. Technologies matured within this Project: inform the Army of potential environmental threats, opportunities, and mission impacts; help decision makers understand environmental threats in urban and industrial contested environments; and provide rapid sensing and assessment of the presence and extent of dangerous compounds in battlefield environments. \n\nA key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies. Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with myriad federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water. This Project includes pilot-scale field studies to demonstrate technological feasibility and optimize performance and productivity of risk mitigation techniques.\n\nFY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi."

Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops and critical fixed and semi-fixed assets. Protection measures support force projection in areas such as air and sea ports of debarkation, dispersed small units, and units operating in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations and future vertical lift. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. Force protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating in disbursed small units over complex and urban terrain and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and nonline-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blast and weapon effects from advanced and emerging threats. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply and manned-unmanned teaming and demonstrates infrastructure health monitoring assessment technologies to support emerging projection challenges in complex, contested environments such as distributed sustainment over large distances. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for \"upfront engineering\" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. \n\nThis work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832\/Project D8Z.\n\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology).

The gaps exist in several categories including threat density, type of threat and representation of specific threat systems and, if not mitigated, will prevent an effective OT for JSF.   The requested funding will procure 12 systems, in four categories, that increase the threat density, threat type and specific threat representation and upgrade an additional two systems to provide a higher fidelity representation of several threat types.   Additionally,  funding supports the initiation of site preparation and integration for radar signal emulators and the requirement to purchase additional materials for the open air radio frequency beam measurement capability.\n\nThe funding increase in the ENEWS program from FY17 to FY18 reflects the addition of one hardware simulator to the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems (ENEWS) hardware simulators to support the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 3. \n\nTechnical: Not applicable.\n\nSchedule: Not applicable."

The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.\n\nThe Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&E).\n\nThis project directly supports the T&E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: ALR-67(v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, ALQ-144A, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.\n\nThis project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD."

The gaps exist in several categories including threat density, type of threat and representation of specific threat systems and, if not mitigated, will prevent an effective OT for JSF.   The requested funding will procure 12 systems, in four categories, that increase the threat density, threat type and specific threat representation and upgrade an additional two systems to provide a higher fidelity representation of several threat types.   Additionally,  funding supports the initiation of site preparation and integration for radar signal emulators and the requirement to purchase additional materials for the open air radio frequency beam measurement capability."

The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Force, Special Operations, and other Electronic Warfare Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for Electronic Warfare system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield\/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems modeling tool that was developed to support Testing and Evaluation.  Simulation Display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) Testing and Evaluation and training ranges to provide visualization of Testing and Evaluation and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is unique in that it is the only project within the Department of Defense dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard Electronic Warfare systems and tactics against these type threats.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  Development Test, Operational Test and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation support includes AN\/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship InfraRed signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and Patrol Craft class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including Test and Evaluation of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' Electronic Warfare systems in joint allied exercises. Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets also support Joint Electronic Warfare exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations."

In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA\/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets and auxiliary payloads are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment.  As to specific hardware development, this project includes:\n\n - Supersonic Targets: GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) and GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) program.  Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats.  The design and development of GQM-163A capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and, to a lesser degree, support fleet training.  Critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events are supported for AEGIS, DDG-1000, LHA-6, CVN-78, LCS, and LSD-41\/49 (SM-6, SM-2, RAM, SSDS, and ESSM).  GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 13.0 to 66 ft.  The GQM-163A has also demonstrated a capability to perform a higher altitude diving threat profile.  Funding was also provided for closing out the GQM-173A (MSST) program.  MSST was a supersonic development effort that was terminated on September 25, 2015.  Remaining funds are planned to cover settlement costs.\n\n - Subsonic Targets: BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-74E targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities.  The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational test & evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events.  Specifically, the BQM-177A SSAT provides critical live-fire test and evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.\n\n - Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems(TMSS), and Target Control and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TC\/TA\/AS) development: The TTSP provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial targets to provide threat representative radio frequency signatures, specifically the electronic attack and threat radar emissions (active emitters).  TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various TMSS including but not limited to: scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification, friend or foe, and associated test sets.  TA\/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide high fidelity simulation of foreign threats.  TA\/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA\/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems.\n\n In addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development.  For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach."

These development efforts will continue to be rolled into the production baseline. Production efforts are expected to continue at higher quantities in order to meet projected MDAP T&E requirements.\n\nCongress was notified on September 25, 2015 that the Department of the Navy made the decision to terminate the Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) development program. Termination settlement efforts are ongoing with DCMA.\n\nSubsonics: The BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target program is an Acquisition Category IVM program. It is currently undergoing developmental testing with Critical Design Review, Test Readiness Review \/ Flight Readiness Review completed in FY16 and Milestone C completed in 1st Quarter FY17. A Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 option contract is scheduled to be awarded in 3rd Quarter FY17. IOC is scheduled for 4th Quarter FY18. After exercising a second prenegotiated option for LRIP 2 in FY18, the program will transition to Full Rate Production in FY19.\n\nTarget Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control, and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems: TTSP will continue to award contracts to support the development of electronic attack & threat radar simulations, ensuring the fleet requirement for simulations of emerging threats is met. Additional contracts will be awarded to support the development and design of TMSS upgrades, including but not limited to the current and next generation Target Control Systems, Scalar Scorers, Scoring Ground Station, Telemetry Antennas, Radar and Locator Beacons, Identification Friend or Foe and associated test sets."

MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability."

MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability."

This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development\/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment\/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on Portfolio Management Decision Support System by capturing and mapping issues\/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk."

This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower & Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions."

CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP)."

Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  \n\nOther evaluation processes are as follows: \nA) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nB) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance."

The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. \nOther evaluation processes: \n\nA) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. \n\nB) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO\/N8 for final review and acceptance. \n\nC) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&L).\n\nD) Navy-CNA Integration Board.  DON 3-stars and CNA leadership meet quarterly to review the annual research program, discuss priorities and related implications for current and future work, and address issues impacting CNA's ability to execute its mission as an FFRDC.  CNA research highlights are also briefed and discussed.  The board meetings are chaired by the Director, Navy Staff."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III Commercialization:\nIn Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters."

                        "val": "International Cooperative RDT&E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.\n\nNaval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  \n\nAssessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.\n\nMid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test & Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.\n\nOperations Integration Group:  Classified\n\nCHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS\/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource\/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.\n\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.\n\nThe Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.\n\nMTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:\n\nThis project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations. Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009). Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States). This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with \"Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations\" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.\n\nThe MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations. This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats.\n\nThis project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:\n\n(1) Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.\n(2) Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.\n(3) Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.\n(4) Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.\n(5) Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.\n(6) Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.\n(7) Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations."

In addition, it develops coherent approaches in coordination with combatant commanders (COCOMs), and appropriate partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative.\n\nThe project scope supports the strategic shift to the Pacific Region with emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Coalition Interoperability.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and Coalition Interoperability requirements. \n\nOngoing cooperative RDT&E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US\/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:\n1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;\n2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;\n3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);\n4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). \n5. Represent the US Navy in Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed Armaments Cooperation Forums, including the Conference of NATO Armaments Directors' groups {NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG)}, and Senior National Representative-Maritime (SNR-M);\n6.  Funding of various international RDT&E support databases including Technical Project Officer (TPO), International Agreement Generators, Information\/Data Exchange Agreements, and Project Agreements\/Memorandums of Understanding;\n7.  Leading the Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP)."

The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Warfare); warfare systems (Expeditionary Warfare & Combat Logistics, Sea Control, and Power Projection) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both warfighting and warfighting-support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, this project also includes funding for Concept Formulation (CONFORM)  \/ Concept Development and Experimentation (CDE) efforts.  This is a shift of funding from PE 0605152N, Studies and Analysis Support, Project 2092, Naval Warfare Studies.  CONFORM\/CDE for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Commands (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  \n-\tThe majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.\n-\tThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.\n-\tOutputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.\nCapabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)\/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and interoperability gaps of both current and future Navy platforms and systems capabilities."

METRIC:  Risks are balanced across capability that delivers the right capabilities within the resources available to Navy.  Navy Assessment Program supports the development of platform specific studies and Capabilities Based Assessments, an analytical effort resulting in Functional Area Analysis, Functional Needs Analysis, and Functional Solution Analysis.  Efforts provide added analytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and support warfare integration initiatives. \n\n-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics, capabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material. METRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling\/methodology to support analysis. Models\/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints. \n\n-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not limited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of large-scale architecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine ability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category Program Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research performance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned systems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations and uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results. \n\n-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy that work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model\/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21 to include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.\n\n-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or support capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in warfighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems and technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program planning to determine the warfighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities. Determine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy. \n\n-World Class Modeling, Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements process that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support analyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation plans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.\nThe May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a CBA to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy."

These on-site assessments of DCI are required to meet annual policy requirements and to ensure assets nominated as Defense Critical Asset (DCA) are fully vetted and validated. Assessment teams will normally consist of a mission analyst and four infrastructure analysts, but team composition may be modified based on the site and assessment requirements. The assessments include pre-site work, on-site work, and post-site report writing. The final assessment report will include collected research such as Baseline Elements of Information (BEI), Benchmarks and Standards, characterizing infrastructure \/ identifying vulnerabilities to missions, and completing the vulnerability portion of the Risk Decision Package. A40 will work with other service and agency teams to supplement data evaluation for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) offices as negotiated between OASD HD's MA Director, the Joint Staff J34 and Service CIP offices"

They will continue to work with OASD HD to refine and mature the Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP), including working with DCIP community members to document suggested improvements and identify interdependency trends and remediation opportunities. They will work with CCMDs, Services, Sectors, and Agencies to conduct deep-dive infrastructure research and develop web services to transfer data between DCIP Systems. A40 will provide reach back desktop analysis support of regions and\/or specific countries across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs), with focus in U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), and U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) AORs in the upcoming period. \n\nIn addition, A40 will provide analytical and on-site assistance, as required, to look at the defense continuity aspects of MA. Additional tasks can include on-site analysis based on OASD HD and CCMD prioritization of needs \/ requirements. Tasks can range between full infrastructure analysis across particular countries for operational planning, to specific infrastructure analysis involving telecommunication assets, the Global Information Grid (GIG), and electric power infrastructure security. A40 will assist Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Policy, Acquisition Technology and Logistics Installations and Environment (AT&L I&E) and AT&L Operational Energy in developing and refining Energy Security documents, presentations, plans, and procedures, and refining lists of potential mitigation options for energy-related vulnerabilities. They will serve as an integrating function by providing a source for historical and ongoing DCIP analysis information \/ assessment research data and feedback, geospatial information, and threat and hazard mapping. They will update and revise MA benchmark standards in conjunction with Joint Staff, Defense Thread Reduction Agency (DTRA), and selected assessment service teams. They will continue to update the DCIP benchmarks and standards data \/ information to support MA program execution requirements."

They will develop inputs and provide the Global Situational Awareness Facility (GSAF) \/ National Military Command Center (NMCC) \/ Joint Staff J33 personnel and senior leaders with actionable analytic products and value-added strategic risk management recommendations for critical decision making during events. They will provide quick response infrastructure research and analysis to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security (OASD(HD&GS)), CCMDs, Services, Sectors, and Agencies in the form of technical analysis and recommendations to the OASD (HD&GS) and the DCIP Community on infrastructure networks and points of service related to pre-event and post-event analysis for manmade or natural disaster incidents and intelligence relating to threats. The crisis response \/ preparation of infrastructure analysis to the DCIP Community will also be utilized during planned exercises.\nThrough this support, A40s infrastructure analysis will help identify the potential crisis impact and will support risk management recommendations during and after the exercises. They will support emergent requirements for DoD and National initiatives at the direction of the OASD (HD&GS). This support may include infrastructure research and subject matter expertise (SME) analysis, participation in DoD or interagency working groups, and infrastructure-related inquiries by congress. They will identify emerging threat vectors and CIP-related gaps in coordination with CCMDs and DoD agencies related to MA and Critical Infrastructure Sectors, and their impacts via white papers and briefings. U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) submissions and on-site liaisons provided per request and approval; participation in USNORTHCOM outreach sessions is anticipated as part of this tasking."

Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with \"Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations\" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.\n\nThe MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. \n\nThis project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:\n\n(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.\n(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.\n(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.\n(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.\n(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.\n(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.\n(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.\n\nStarting in FY17, funding for MTMD is realigned from Program Element 0603582N Combat System Integration."

This PE directly supports the China Strategic Initiative's (CSI) Strategic Emulations LOE, expanding those outputs to the operational level, making insights timely and relevant to USPACOM (and other Combatant Commands), Functional Component Force Commanders across all strategic domains (e.g. cyber, air and space, sea etc.) in support of national-level mandated operational and strategic-level contingency planning.  \n\nOperational Decision Analysis (ODA). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on ODA sub Line of Effort support effort with at least 80% of initial objectives being achieved by 3QTR FY18.\n\nThis PE provides funding to support continuing requirement for studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). The PE directly support CSI's Strategic Emulation LOE and will provide critical technical inputs and strategic insights that complement the program's OE output database, which is still under development. ODA outputs will significantly enhance Combatant Component Command staffs with their operational and intelligence planning and global synchronization across multiple domains amongst all geographic and functional combatant commands.  \n\nDecision Support Elements to Operational Emulation Modeling and Simulation (DSEOMS). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on this major LOE with at least 80% of initial objectives being met by 3QTR FY19.\n\nThis PE provides funding to support all four major LOEs for the CSI program?and all its sub-LOEs. This effort will provide a comprehensive and campaign-quality decision support toolset to decision makers across the entire CSI enterprise: OSD, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Intelligence Community, and the Whole of US Government (Interagency). This PE will create a set of enhanced automated and doctrinal decision- making tools to assist key policy- and strategic leaders on a full spectrum of contingencies related to competitor nations. DSEOMS will provide analytic modeling and simulation tools that take inputs from all major CSI program LOEs; the goal being to present decision- and policy-makers and their planning staffs with a rich dataset of information that is relevant, timely, and substantive for their respective problem sets. The current scope and focus across all LOE's is to support emerging near-term and longer-term planning to both significantly enhance war planning orientation and force posture considerations but also to significantly enhance more informed strategic choices regarding future joint\/service capability investments and joint\/service operational concepts across all strategic domains.   Ultimately, fully integrated program deliverables will guide a deliberative process for identifying efficiencies in major service platform decisions to ensure they are optimized for the full-spectrum of projected adversary capabilities in the future."

Within that report, the NRC detailed four critical issue areas that needed to be addressed in the interest of national security.  Those issue areas included; Trust, Supply Chain, Organic (DoD) Capability Sustainment, and Technology Development.  \n\nIntense global competition in the Printed Circuit Board (PrCB) industry has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of United States PrCB companies, leaving the domestic PrCB industrial base \"fragile\" and progressively declining in capability and health.  Implementation of the strategies developed by the EA for PrCB Technologies will proactively ensure that the U.S. PrCB industry is capable of supporting future DoD electronics requirements.  The strategic plan is expected to indentify technology gaps and research and development needs, as well as identify and recommend policy changes.\n\nIn addition to benefiting DoD by ensuring access to leading edge PrCB technology, it is expected that the EA program will help the struggling domestic PrCB industry by indentifying future technology research and development needs and securing the domestic military market."

This project funds ONR HQ Non-Management Headquarters Activities (Non-MHA) salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  In FY16 and out, the Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plan effort will be transferred into this project from PE 0605853N Project 3025 to support ONR's goal of attaining a clean and auditable financial statement. ONR sponsors scientific advances, which lead to Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs), supporting the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority. Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation\/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD\/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances. This project also supports ONR Non-MHA management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs:  Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities\/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program. \n\nAdditionally, this project funds ONR field salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  Functions performed support ONR's Navy-wide responsibilities in the negotiation and establishment of indirect cost rates for DoD-assigned universities and performance of contract administration for all DoD contracts\/grants at all colleges and universities."

This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft\/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Aircraft Structure Periodic Adjustments (ASPA), Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, Aviation Climate Assessment Survey System (ACASS) and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&E requirements.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead\/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN\/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.\n\nEnterprise Cost elements:\na) SDTS Acquisition includes the direct procurement costs of major Combat Systems (CS) elements which will be installed on the SDTS.\n\nb) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nc) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, DDG 1000, LCS 7, LCS 8 and CVN 78.\n\nd) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, LCS 7, LCS 8 and CVN 78.\n\ne) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).\n\nf) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.\n\ng) Maintenance of CS includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nThe T&E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&S) data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test."

Project Unit 3386, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Marine Vessels, is a new start FY17 program which will provide the overhauls and preventative maintenance of the 23 MRTFB marine vessels located at NAWCWD, Point Mugu, CA, PMRF, Honolulu, HI, NUWC Keyport Nanoose and Dabob Bay Ranges, Keyport, WA, NAWCAD, Patuxent River, MD, and NUWC Detachment (AUTEC).  The T&E activities make up the Navy portion of the Department of Defense's MRTFB. These activities are chartered to perform T&E for the development and acquisition of technology advanced weapons systems. Core T&E capabilities and capacity are operated to obtain weapons system performance documentation for acquisition program milestone decisions to provide operational forces with effective weapons systems. This program provides Navy Acquisition Program Managers required test capabilities; lowers cost of T&E; removes cost and scheduling impact of providing their own T&E resources; and retains the physical airspace, land space and sea space needed to conduct testing."

The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  \n\nAUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  \n\nMajor test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 \/Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.\n\nAUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier\/marine area include fully equipped machine \/fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track."

These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and T&E aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.

The funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD.\n\nThe cyber manpower increase is offset by the realignment of 14 Management Headquarters Activity (MHA) FTE from this program element into 0902498N Management Headquarters (Departmental Support Accounts).\n\n\nTechnical: N\/A\n\nSchedule: N\/A"

This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop \"minimum, adequate\" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources."

The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&S costs for day to day operations of the staff\/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&S costs typical of military field commands\/activities). Within this project, over 1\/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead\/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV\/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned\/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&E offices\/activities, and miscellaneous other customers\/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint\/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            \n                              \nNumber of Tests Conducted - FY16 = 103; FY17 = 104; FY18 = 108\nNumber of Programs Supported - FY16 = 422; FY17 = 424; FY18 = 424"

This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. \n\n(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar\/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.  It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems.\n\n(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.\n\n(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system\/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.\n\n(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program.  The program investigates Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental effects between shipboard transmitters\/receivers and develops EM and spectrum techniques with Commercial off the shelf (COTS)  technologies to provide the ability to monitor EM spectrum usage and system EM degradation on all ships in a given strike group.  The program will investigate technologies to build an EM Spectrum Common Operational Picture (COP) to detect and assess operational capabilities in real-time.  Additional investigations will be performed to develop processes and procedures to predict the EM environment for planning purposes.  In the out-years, these capabilities will be used to build the next generation combat system with inherent spectrum agility and self-awareness capability, further enhancing the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain."

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF). \n\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development. Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).\n  \n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.\n  \n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

In compliance with Executive Order #13589 OAD's major focus is achieving greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation through operations research methodologies such as: statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations. Division analysts are credited with innovations in analysis of amphibious operations and Irregular Warfare (IW) that have expanded state-of-the-art operations research methods across DOD. OAD quantifies resource allocation decisions pertaining to weapon systems, strategic personnel, training management, and equipment acquisition. Efforts are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan and Planning Guidance. \n\nFuture studies support Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF's) and Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU's) with research analysis and modeling and simulation focused on aviation, amphibious, and ground operations enhancing the ability of the Marine Corps to increase operational, logistical and equipment efficiencies and capabilities and provide a unique, well trained, equipped and educated force.  \n\nThis program element has been revised into two specialized analytical divisions: (1) External Analysis Division (EAD) - responsible for providing joint external analysis is the Marine Corps' sole representative in the joint modeling arenas.  Provides deployed on site professional operations analysis support to Special Purpose MAGTFs in CENTCOM and AFRICOM.  (2) Combat Development Analysis Division responsible for executing a select portfolio of studies for senior leadership, Capabilities Based Assessment (CAB) and Marine Corps Enterprise Integration Plan (MCEIP)."

The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n\nMarine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations."

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements.

The FLEX program considers warfighting gaps identified in: Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL) generated by Warfighting Development Centers (WDC); USFF\/CPF's Integrated Priorities Letter (IPL) delivered annually to the CNO; USFF\/CPF's Commanders' FLEX Guidance; and Navy and Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statements. In addition, FLEX addresses innovative concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps as defined by annual FLEX guidance. Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war simulations, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Naval-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&T), academia, and industry partners.\n\n\tExperimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities. As such, the FLEX program directly supports four of the five elements outlined in the Secretary of the Navy's Innovation Vision: Build the Naval Innovation Network, Improve the Use of DON Information, Accelerate Emerging Operational Capabilities to the Fleet, and Develop Game-Changing Warfighting Concepts.\n\nExpeditionary SFOC Communications (Classified Project) will transfer from Project 3319 (FLEX) to Project 3420 (Expeditionary SFOC Communications) in FY18."

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection\/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

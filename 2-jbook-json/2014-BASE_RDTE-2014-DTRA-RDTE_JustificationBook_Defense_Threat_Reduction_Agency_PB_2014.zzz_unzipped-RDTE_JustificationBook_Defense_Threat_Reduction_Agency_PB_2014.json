                            "val": "The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) safeguards America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, counter the threat, and mitigate its effects.  The Basic Research Initiative program provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers drawn primarily from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry.  This leverages Department of Defense\u2019s $2 billion annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting Weapons of Mass Destruction-related defense missions and by improving Agency knowledge of other research efforts of potential benefit to DTRA nonproliferation, counter proliferation and consequence management efforts.  \n\nThese efforts are closely coordinated with the Chem-Bio Technology portfolio, which executes a basic research program under the joint Chem-Bio Defense Program.  Agency research interests are coordinated with those of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Service basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.\n\nThe DTRA\u2019s Basic Research Initiative program element supports several National and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD.  The 2010 QDR directs capability enhancements, including: accelerate the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; and prevent proliferation and counter weapons of mass destruction with specific initiatives to: 1) Research countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents, 2) Enhance nuclear forensics, 3) Secure vulnerable materials, 4) Develop new verification technologies, and 5) Develop an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are individuals, networks, or states.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under projects RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.   Additionally, it supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities.  This strategy spells out four focus areas:  1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events, 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences, 3) Expand of our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (capability expansion), and 4) Leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).   Again all four focus areas are supported in this program element under Project RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.  In the general sense, these efforts are relevant for biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications, including passive and\/or remote sensing; and expand- our capability to apprehend those engaged in bio-weapons proliferation and terrorism by supporting basic research on bio-agent neutralization and bio-agent defeat employing combustion or deflagration.

This leverages the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) $2 billion annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting Weapons of Mass Destruction-related defense missions and by improving Agency knowledge of other research efforts of potential benefit to Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) nonproliferation, counter proliferation and consequence management efforts. \n\nThese efforts are closely coordinated with the Chem-Bio Technology Portfolio, which executes a basic research program under the joint Chem-Bio Defense Program.  Agency research interests are coordinated with those of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Service basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.\n\nProject RU (Fundamental Research for Combating WWD) supports several National and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD.  The 2010 QDR directs capability enhancements, including: accelerate the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; and prevent proliferation and counter weapons of mass destruction with specific initiatives to: 1) Research countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents, 2) Enhance nuclear forensics, 3) Secure vulnerable materials, 4) Develop new verification technologies, and 5) Develop an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are individuals, networks, or states.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under projects RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.   Additionally, this Project supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 1) Global Health Security, 2) Life Sciences, 3) Capability Expansion, and 4) Leveraging Science.  The DTRA Basic Research program accomplishes research in the life sciences, which has cross-cutting applicability and thus is relevant to a variety of DoD mission spaces, within and outside of those related to countering biological threats.  In the general sense, these efforts are relevant for biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications, including passive and\/or remote sensing; and they expand our capability to apprehend those engaged in bio-weapons proliferation and terrorism by supporting basic research on bio-agent neutralization and bio-agent defeat employing combustion or deflagration.  Finally, this project supports and administers the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program \"Cooperative C-WMD research with global partners program\", for which the core goals are to secure dangerous pathogens, promote open and active disease reporting and response, and advance transparent research to understand pathogens and develop potential countermeasures.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to a reduction in the number of grants awarded and the elimination of dedicated support to transition discoveries to DTRA applied research.\n\nThe increase in FY 2014 is due to increased investment in Fundamental Research to maintain zero real growth in funding per the Defense Planning Guidance for activities related to the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge for the benefit of Counter WMD related defense missions."

                            "val": "The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense level guidance\/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy, Unified Command Plan, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Counterproliferation Interdiction, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Military Strategy, Global Development of Forces, Global Employment of Forces, National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  Three of these objectives are to deter the use of WMD, reduce the present threat, and to prepare for the future threat.  A focused and strong threat reduction technology base is critical to achieving these objectives and is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up its combat support mission.  DTRA has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.\n\nActivities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support strengthening nonproliferation, through the development of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) and development of Arms Control inspection training and operational capabilities.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental CWMD research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund development and operation of the STRATCOM-DTRA SCC-WMD Technical Reachback center, which supports all GCC, US and Allied Forces, and civil authorities with 24\/7 analysis support, enabling force and civilian population protection against WMD attack.\n\nThe DTRA\u2019s WMD Defeat Technologies program element also supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities. The strategy spells out four focus areas:  1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events, 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences, 3) Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (Capability Expansion), and 4) Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capabilities to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).   There are two of the four focus areas (3 and 4) supported in this program element under projects RA-Information Science and Applications, RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RR-Test Infrastructure.  Details are provided in the R-2a exhibits.\n\nProject RA (Information Science and Application) develops innovative technologies and modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities and provides Technical Reachback support to create decision advantage for the U.S. and our Allies through improved situational understanding across the complete CWMD mission space.\n\nProject RE (Counter-Terrorism Technologies) provides research and development support to Joint U.S. Military Forces, specifically U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Device Defeat; counter-WMD technologies for warfighters; the USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP); and oversight of counterproliferation (CP) research and development resources sent directly to USSOCOM for warfighter-unique CP technologies.  \n\nProject RF (Detection and Forensics Technologies) develops technologies, systems and procedures for post detonation nuclear forensics, and to detect, identify, track, tag, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, materials, or infrastructure in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  \n\nProject RG (Defeat Technologies) develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.\n\nProject RI (Nuclear Survivability) provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  \n\nProject RL (Nuclear & Radiological Effects) develops nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions.  \n\nProject RM (WMD Counterforce Technologies) provides (1) full-scale testing of counter WMD weapon effects, sensor performance, and weapon delivery optimization, (2) weapon effects modeling, and (3) the DTRA Experimentation Lab.  \n   \nProject RR (Test Infrastructure) provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated WMD facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the DoD, the Services, the Combatant Commanders and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets. \n\nProject RU (Fundamental Research for Combating WMD) provides (1) strategic studies to support DoD, (2) decision support tools and analysis to support combating WMD research and development investments, and (3) early applied research for technology development."

The systems engineering effort provides research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capability necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  It also conducts the development, validation and fielding of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) as a part of the U.S. commitment under arms control treaties.  The innovative counterproliferation effort conducts research and development to investigate, identify, develop and transition short term, high payoff technologies from Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), other government agencies, industry, academia and international Science and Technology partners into the respective DTRA and other research and development programs and to end user organizations.  The technical reachback effort provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This project also provides support to international Counter-WMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts.\n\nProgram RA supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  DTRA\u2019s integration of the Chemical-Biological Simulation Suite into the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) Tactical Training System (CTTS) toolset to represent the threat delivery, hazard environment, and real-time sensors will be utilized for training and passive defense within the battlespace.  Particularly in support of Leveraging Science, DTRA continues comprehensive information exchanges with Chief of Science and Technology (S&T) Offices across various agencies responsible for countering biological threats in response to SecDef S&T Priorities Memorandum.   This program also targets development of a common picture of biological threats, clarification of lead on specific counter bio mission areas, and collaboration on common technology development.  \n\t\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominantly due to reduced investment in systems engineering collaboration with external partners and customers and the slowing development and fielding of innovative technologies to the warfighter.  The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in research and development analysis support to fund increased investment in RU-Fundamental Research for Combatting WMD and RG-Defeat Technologies."

This project researches, develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced technologies to improve operational capabilities to detect and identify nuclear and radiological weapons.  It supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) operational capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics and materials analysis, and prompt diagnostics and device reconstruction.  Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on-site and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring and confidence-building requirements.\n\nThe Detection and Forensics Technologies project under Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation Prevention and Defeat emphasizes the advanced technology development and engineering portion of the overall effort.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the redirection of the nuclear detection portfolio toward a more holistic Nuclear Threat Detection portfolio that integrates both passive and active radiation detection into a comprehensive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) solution. This resulted in a decreased investment in advanced detector technology to fund increased investment in nuclear weapons effects in Project RI - Nuclear Survivability and system vulnerability and assessment capabilities in Project RL - Nuclear and Radiological Effects. \n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in Detection Technology to fund increased investment in nuclear weapons effects research for survivability in Project RL - Nuclear & Radiological Effects."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the COCOM's WMD Defeat CONOPS and their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  This program includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal C-WMD capability.\n\nThe investment approach is based on a strategic top-down analysis of threat vulnerabilities and aligned with stated organizational core competencies and lines of operations aimed at the defeat of (1) the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) the ability to deliver the same, and (3) the support networks, both physical and non-physical, enabling both.  The program places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within some mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Our end-state is to provide COCOMs with accurate and timely WMD defeat expertise, tailored technologies, and customized solutions that provide offensive weapons and capabilities to combat WMD in any target while mitigating collateral contamination effects.  Without these capabilities our nation cannot effectively hold at risk our adversaries\u2019 WMD capabilities thus giving them strategic advantage.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 represents an efficiency reduction to contract support services as part of Departmental efficiency initiatives to reduce reliance on service support contractors.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in Counter-WMD hard target defeat weapons development."

Emphasis is on ionizing radiation effects. The Nuclear Survivability project provides Radiation Hardened (RadHard) Microelectronics and Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation research.  Funding in this project also supports the expanding role of the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) program into Science & Technology development for human survivability.\n\nThe NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct research in radiation effects, and validate computational models.  The Nuclear Survivability Experimental Capabilities program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration and the United Kingdom Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new, enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays and neutrons.\n \nThe Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides support for the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group (JAIEG) and the international Weapon Effects Steering Committee (WESC) that was called the NWE Users\u2019 Group.  The WESC establishes standards for U.S. and U.K. nuclear weapons effects simulation codes and models as defined and prioritized by the nuclear community, and serves as a forum for sharing information on nuclear technologies, gaps and plans.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 was predominately due to decreased in investment in nuclear weapons effects relative to a nonrecurring increase for a Short Pulse Gamma (SPG) simulation capability in FY 2012 and decreased investment in human survivability beginning in FY 2013.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in nuclear weapons effects experimental capabilities."

The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology (WEP) tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates\/modifies software to more accurately model cratering effects, fragmentation (both primary & secondary), internal air blast, equipment\/container damage, structural response, and penetration.  These efforts will lead to advanced modeling and simulation capability in the countering WMD planning tools, to include the Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) planning tool used for weaponeering and the Vulnerability Assessment and Protection Option (VAPO) planning tools used for force\/structure protection.  The Advanced Energetics & Counter WMD Weapons Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD\/HDBTs. The Advanced Energetics Program also develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast\/frag warhead technology.\n  \nThe DTRA Experimentation Lab Capability is an Agency-wide capability that assures the timely acquisition, synchronization, correlation and delivery of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) consequence management and mitigation data necessary in combating WMD.  The DTRA Experimentation Lab will be the \u201ckey enabler\u201d allowing the Agency to transform successfully into an interoperable DoD Science and Technology environment.  Using the DTRA Experimentation Lab, DTRA will be able to shape and improve military situational awareness independent of time or location, effectively shorten decision cycles in a CBRNE event, and extend DTRA\u2019s knowledge base externally through collaborative technologies.\n\nProgram RM supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion.  DTRA is developing blast explosives technologies such as the EG Hybridized Enhanced Blast Explosive (HEBX) as well as reactive cases for explosives used for countering special targets including biological weapons. The approach is to develop an enhanced explosive fill that will envelop the target with a high temperature caustic environment that will kill any bio-agents released during the strike.\n\nDTRA initiated efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced material science solutions to support WMD Counterforce missions.  This effort investigates the relationship between the structure of materials at atomic or molecular scales and their macroscopic properties.  The goal of this program is to provide a practical mechanism to develop, demonstrate and deliver novel materials for several WMD counterforce missions. Materials developed under this auspice will have use in these areas; Energetic Materials, Non-Kinetic defeat, Agent Defeat (Biological) and Interfacial materials for WMD Sensors\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the reallocation of funds from infrastructure development in Project RR - Test Infrastructure to weapons effects and planning tools in Project RM \u2013 WMD Counterforce Technologies to properly align mission responsibilities.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in Advanced Energetics and DTRA Wargaming to fund increased investment in WMD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance activities."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.\n\nThis project supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  DTRA conducts an intergovernmental test program with the Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) for Biological Agent Defeat testing.  In FY 2014 DTRA will continue research for Biological Re-aerosolization in conjunction with DoD\/DHS\/EPA to help develop precise measurement technologies for residual biological pathogens reentering air after settling\u2014Canceled by DHS.  In addition, DTRA supports the development and demonstration of Transatlantic Collaboration Biological Resiliency Demo (TACBRD), a DoD capability to shape interagency approach to counter a wide area biological event impacting U.S. and partner nations\u2019 key civilian\/military infrastructure.  Particularly in support of capability expansion, DTRA conducts Interagency Biological Restoration Demonstration (IBRD) testing in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reduce the time and resources necessary to recover and restore wide urban areas, military installations, and critical infrastructure, following a biological incident, but is transitioning into TaCBRD.  Additionally, DTRA is funding an internal Research program (Innovative Research Program) which examines the novel use of \u201cMicroNeedles\u201d for use in physiological monitoring and\/or drug delivery; This project is being conducted by Sandia National Labs and the first phase will be completed by February 28, 2013.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the reallocation of funds from infrastructure development in Project RR - Test Infrastructure to weapons effects and Planning tools in Project RM - Counterforce Technologies, and reduced investment in test infrastructure environment restoration support and the WMD National Test Bed (TB).  \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the realignment of test bed facilities from RT-Target Assessment Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to RR-Test Infrastructure in PE 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of those activities."

It may be possible, however, to achieve target defeat objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires more information and more detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available weapons, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets located in underground facilities and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support either physical or functional defeat.  Extending this activity and applying these processes to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) target characterization and threat analysis presents the next technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project now consists of three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technology Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technology Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technology Support.  Follow-on funding for this project can be found in the Proliferation Prevention and Defeat; 0603160BR, budget exhibit."

To accomplish this objective, seven project areas were developed: RA - Information Science and Applications, RE - Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF \u2013 Detection and Forensics Technologies, RG - Defeat Technologies, RI - Nuclear Survivability, RM - WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT - Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01).  The missions and plans of these projects are described below and in the R-2a Budget Exhibits.  \n\nThe DTRA\u2019s Proliferation, Prevention and Defeat program element supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities. The strategy spells out four focus areas: 1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events, 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences, 3) Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (Capability Expansion), and 4) Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).  There are three of the four focus areas (1, 3, and 4) supported in this program element under projects RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  Details are provided in the R-2a exhibits."

The systems engineering effort provides research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capability necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  This includes analysis of National, Department of Defense (DoD) and other Federal agencies' strategic guidance and plans in the combating WMD, Combating Terrorism and Homeland Defense arenas through analytical political-military and technical studies, workshops and conferences.  The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This project also provides support to international CWMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts. Further, this project provides the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on-site support to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) with a current primary focus on support to U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), NATO, and SHAPE in combating WMD and maintaining the NATO nuclear deterrent.  A significant element of this project includes support to Command Elements and the warfighting Combatant Commands (COCOMs) on strategies for reducing\/countering the WMD threat in the COCOMs Areas of Responsibility.  This project also provides for the solution to the Secretary of Defense mandate for DTRA to account, maintain, report, and track the National Nuclear Weapons Stockpile & Nuclear Weapon-Related Materiel during peacetime, crisis, and wartime.  In support of national requirements necessary to maintain a viable nuclear deterrent, the Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services provides a platform to ensure continued sustainability and viability of the nuclear weapon stockpile. Finally, it conducts the development, validation and fielding of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) as a part of the U.S. commitment under arms control treaties\n\nThe FY 2012 to FY 2013 decrease is predominately due to the net effect of a one-time increased investment for the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) in FY 2012 and a realignment of funding from Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to PE 0602718BR for the information technology test and engineering program for Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) 3.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the net effect of the consolidation of Reachback Support operations in Project RM - WMD Counterforce Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR and increased investment in research and development analysis support funded by a transfer from PE 0602718BR."

This project supports Joint U.S. Military Forces, and in particular, the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  This research and development support directly enhances USSOCOM, the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy, to Combat WMD, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force, and therefore a high priority for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The following efforts are included in this project:\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation (CP) research and development program is a collaborative effort with US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) where the DTRA manages and sub-allocates funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM\u2019s Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CT\/CP) mission.  New CT\/CP technologies are developed under USSOCOM management that provides warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers along multiple nodes concurrently or simultaneously within the terrorist pathway to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces in support of CT\/CP offensive operations.\n\nThe USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) addresses Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Unified Command Plan (UCP) for integrating and synchronizing operations and activities to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD.\n\nFurther, Program RE supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus areas 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  One example is Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation (CP) research and development, which funds rapid technology development to provide warfighters with the operational capability to prevent employment of biological weapons.  Further details are classified.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment for CWMD-T testing and defeat programs. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in CWMD-T support to USSOCOM."

This project researches, develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced technologies to improve operational capabilities to detect and identify nuclear and radiological weapons.  It supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics and materials analysis, and prompt diagnostics and device reconstruction.  Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on- and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring and confidence-building requirements.\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to added emphasis on the new Nuclear Threats mission area, and additional resources that were added to determining the military utility of Integrated Stand-off Inspection System (ISIS).\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in Arms Control Monitoring and Verification activities and Advanced Detector Technology due to the completion of two long term projects."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the COCOM's WMD Defeat CONOPS and their AOR.  This program includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal C-WMD capability.\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to increased investment in Counter WMD Hard Target Defeat (HTD) Weapons Development to mature and demonstrate innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capability for the physical or functional defeat of the WMD structures, functions, and\/or the agents themselves with a minimum of collateral effects from incidental release of agent. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in CWMD HTD Weapons Technologies efforts."

This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high performance prototype microelectronics to support the availability of RHM and photonics for DoD missions from both private sector and government organizations. \n\nMighty Guardian Force-on-Force Tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to service procurement.\n\nNuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and Loss of Assured Safety due to accidents, fires or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of COCOMs and Services.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to an increased investment in experimental capabilities and radiation hardened microelectronics.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to decreased investment in Mighty Guardian and Radiation Hardened Microelectronics."

This activity specifically focuses on two critical components in countering the WMD threat: \nDevelop end-to-end planning capabilities including weaponeering tools to aid the Combatant Commander's (COCOM) targeting and weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets.  Deliver modernized, validated and fast running attack planning tools and integrating software.  Leverage attack planning tools to support force protection planners and vulnerability assessment teams. \nDevelop, integrate, demonstrate and transition emerging\/innovative technologies to provide the warfighter with an enhanced near real-time combat and battle damage assessment capability.  Capability is achieved through the development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and weapon-based sensors, platforms, taggants, seekers and other innovative technologies to; remotely sense, identify, track and target WMD-related threats; perform battle damage assessment\/indication of strikes against these threats; and locate, track, collect, detect, selectively identify, and characterize Chemical Weapon and Biological Weapon aerosol agents released during these WMD counterforce strikes.\n\nThis project supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 1) Global Health Security and 3) Capability Expansion.  The DTRA initiated a Bio Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Initiative to develop technologies and tactics that improve the national ability to search for, detect, and identify biological terrorist threats before release. This initiative will develop layered sensing technologies that can be used within a fused approach to enhance the detection of biological threats.  The intent is to provide a capability to narrow the area of interest so that a localized search can be accomplished using collection, in-field confirmatory, and close in Bio-threat analysis technologies.\n\nThe Technical Reachback support provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to termination of DTRA\u2019s Near Real Time Battle Damage Assessment Program for Global Strike.\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in WMD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance activities and the consolidation of Reachback Support operations from Project RA-Information Science and Applications."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD. Related funding for this project can be found in the WMD Defeat Technologies; 0602718BR, budget exhibit."

It may be possible or preferable, to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and the Intelligence Community (IC) the analytical tools and process required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs and then, in near-real-time, assessing the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis present a further technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project is meeting this challenge through three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technology Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technology Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technology Development.\n\nProgram RT supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  The Counter WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) technology development program has cooperative Research and Development projects with the United Kingdom and Commonwealth nations.  The C-WAC is developing information sharing means with Commonwealth nations.  The C-WAC project is also developing the Bio Dual-Use Support Tool as an aid in discriminating the employment of dual use technologies in the disguised development of bio warfare capabilities.    \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment in Counter-WMD Analysis Cell collaboration with the National Counterproliferation Center (NCPC) and the Intelligence Community.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in development of tools for the analysis of chemical weapons threats, decreased investment in the development and integration of sensor systems for target characterization and assessment, and the realignment of test bed facilities to RR-Test Infrastructure in PE 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of those activities."

This funding specifically supports (1) the development of collaborative CWMD analysis capabilities between DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework in the form of the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT) and (2) technologies to meet national International Monitoring System (IMS) technology requirements in support of implementation, compliance, monitoring, and inspection for existing and emerging nuclear arms control activities under the Nuclear Arms Control Technology (NACT) program.\n\nThe WMD Defeat Capabilities program element supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities, and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD AT&L).  The general strategy spells out four focus areas:  1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events, 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences, 3) Expand of our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (Capability Expansion);  and 4) Leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).   In addition to the broad priorities, there are specific objectives to support the WMD monitoring through Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDTE) in support of implementation, compliance, monitoring, and inspection for existing and emerging nuclear arms control activities. Details are provided in the R-2a exhibits.\n\nProject RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies supports the Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) Program, conducting Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to meet International Monitoring System (IMS) technology requirements in support of implementation, compliance, monitoring, and inspection for existing and emerging nuclear arms control activities.  \n\nProject RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects develops and provides a real-time globally accessible net-centric framework which migrates the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Combating WMD decision support capabilities."

The project directly provides for the US contribution to the IMS and addresses Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD AT&L).  This project conforms to the Administration\u2019s research and development priorities as related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs and provide the data required to  inform  compliance assessments and support US monitoring policy and decision-makers and negotiation teams.  The DTRA conducts technology developments and system improvement projects to ensure these monitoring capabilities are available when required.  \n\nPrimary emphasis is on improved sensor sustainability,  availability and detection capabilities against a wide range of threat or event origins and enhanced monitoring system sustainability and availability.  The program includes development of monitoring and analysis equipment and capabilities and procedures for data exchanges,  inspections, and analyses.  The technologies and procedures developed in the NACT program provide a vital source of information on treaty mandated equipment and procedures that are extensively used by US and international agencies.  This project also supports the warfighting capability area of combatting WMD. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of the Nuclear Arms Control Technology (NACT) program to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The NACT program will transfer from United States Army Space Missile Development Command  (SMDC) to DTRA beginning in FY 2014."

Conduct signal capture and identification studies to reduce signal clutter, false alarms, and improve noise rejection methods and algorithms.\n- Continue planning to evaluate options for performing experiments or demonstrations to evaluate system performance to monitor a planned underground or underwater detonation.  The detonation will be non-nuclear in nature but configured to simulate the release of suitable surrogate nuclear testing signatures.  All associated signatures will be acceptable to environmental and health regulations and of a nature suitable to challenge IMS monitoring technologies.\n- Continue radio-xenon gas detection system development and research.  Study and evaluate atmospheric and subsurface xenon backgrounds and transport phenomenon.  \n- Continue a study of baseline noble gas detection schemes and select the pathway for future radio-xenon detection options providing enhanced detection and operational capabilities and reliability.  This study is paying close attention to timeline and feasibility of implementation alternatives.\n- Continue infrasound information system enhancements and development of infrasound propagation models to improve detection, identification, and discrimination of sources and signatures of interest.\n-  Continue field experiments to collect data required to constrain and validate models.  Models will include fine-scale atmospheric conditions, topography, 3-D winds and effects of non-linear propagation.\n-  Continue to develop a portable\/rapid deployable infrasound array and standard sound source for calibrating infrasound stations\/arrays.  \n- Continue on-location infrasound event calibration and metrology research at established engineering and development test centers (EDTC), continue development of EDTCs to support research, testing, and evaluation relevant to station shutdowns, configuration changes, and invasive procedures, and  use EDTCs to perform primary evaluations of prototype monitoring arrays and related new technologies and all associated field testing.   \n- Continue R&D on support system to collect and prioritize station operator requirements to inform required design-build-test activities across the monitoring system.  Focus areas continue to be improvements to radionuclide detector cooling and functionality, filtration medium and sample head, and electronic controls.\n- Continue US IMS sensor event signal identification technique research and development of the transportable xenon laboratory (TXL) and associated xenon detection system and prepare for international deployment exercises and demonstrations.  Operations and maintenance performed in advance of the TXL foreign deployment will establish an operations baseline for this xenon monitoring capability and provide unique opportunities to diagnose and resolve remaining operational and technical concerns and issues, including investigating the \u201cmemory effect\u201d recently encountered in these systems as a result of the unintended radio-xenon releases from the Fukushima reactors.  Also planned is a continuation of infrasound event clutter and false alarm reduction, and noise mitigation analyses.  \n- Continue to drive improvements in radionuclide detection and measurement, including xenon gas collection\/analysis systems research.  Evaluate detection limits, and yields.  The PTS technical requirements dictate that the US radionuclide laboratory (RL-16) gas system requires additional capability to meet required detection thresholds.  Develop test methods to increase xenon gas yields, improve detection efficiencies, and decrease dead volume.  To ensure RL-16 is making a high precision measurement, analysis samples will be peer reviewed and calibrated at certified laboratories.\n- Continue to develop a robust, high-precision method to calibrate nuclear detectors and calibration methods to obtain the absolute calibration of the system\u2019s nuclear detector."

Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrates legacy capabilities and facilitates data sharing through a net-centric framework. It will provides near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT).  The IWMDT migrates Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Countering WMD decision support capabilities. The framework is the only operational CBRNE framework in the world which provides capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by International, National, State, and local authorities.  \n\nThe Net-Centric Architecture program includes three functional areas: 1) IWMDT, 2) IWMDT Codes, and 3) Software Assurance, Certification, and Accreditation.  The IWMDT functional area develops the architecture, defines and implements the standards to consolidate validated Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) tools, and through this architecture, enables rapid access for planning, emergency response, and assessment capabilities.  These capabilities are used by a wide range of planners, managers, and operational and technical personnel facing the full spectrum of CBRNE threats.  The IWMDT Codes functional area develops analysis and simulation codes, and then integrates the codes into the IWMDT architecture. These activities are unique to this effort across the Department of Defense (DoD). They directly support analysis capabilities in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Studies and Analysis Group, and Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD CAPE), US Pacific Command and United States Forces Korea (USFK) offices, Republic of Korea (ROK) Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Defense Taiwan, as well as providing unique simulation capabilities to the Air Force Distributed Mission Operation Center.  The Software Assurance, Certification and Accreditation functional area supports all aspects of DTRA software development and fielding.  This sub-project extends research and development to system development and demonstration. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to increased investment for fielding of IWMDT."

IWMDT was funded in 2004 by a competitive Cost plus award fee (CPAF) contract for $12.425M over a 3-year period.  At end of FY 2006, its follow-on contract was awarded with an initial $.300M increment.  IWMDT program efforts have continued into FY 2013 with $35.26M now applied.  Likewise, the NuCS program was funded under a competitive Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract over a 3-year period with funding of $5.913M applied through FY 2008; a follow-on contract has now been awarded with initial funding to date of $2.356M to continue program efforts, this effort is not funded past FY11 under this line.  COE was funded under a competitive CPFF contract with increments to date of $6.566M total.   NUCS and COE will no longer be funded under this line.  Task Order 00055 (IWMDT) Option 1 of the base contract was issued Nov 2012 for an 18 month period of performance.  In May 2014 the current task order will be completed and all follow-on work will be performed under the new IDIQ contract as a new task order."

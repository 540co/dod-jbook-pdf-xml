The DSS is responsible for overseeing the protection of classified information and technologies, and materials in the hands of cleared industry by ensuring compliance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) on behalf of 26 Department of Defense (DoD) components and 31 other U.S. Federal agencies. The NISP serves as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security program to protect classified information and to preserve our Nation\u2019s economic and technological interests. The DSS provides security oversight, counterintelligence coverage and support to approximately 10,000 cleared companies (comprising over 13,000 industrial facilities and about 850,000 cleared contractors), and accreditation of more than 55,000 workstations across multiple and differing classified networks that process classified information and 160 Secure Internet Protocol Router Networks (SIPRNet) nodes.  The DSS NISP oversight role includes responsibility for the majority of the cleared contractors in the United States to include determination, issuance, and oversight of facility security clearances and making determination that contractor employees are eligible to access classified information. The oversight roles include: Conducting required NISP assessments to deter, detect, and identify loss or compromise of classified information and ensure corrective actions; Accrediting classified contractor computer systems to allow industry to perform on classified programs; Completing Foreign Ownership, Control, and Influence (FOCI) mitigation agreements and properly analyzing, evaluating and providing oversight to cleared firms under FOCI agreements."

Funds are needed to continue the development of the National Industrial Security System (NISS). NISS increment 2 will provide critical functionality with a cross domain solution between NIPR and SIPR environments as well as create a SIPR version of the NISS application. This capability bridges the foundational technology gap with the DSS risk based threat approach to oversee the protection of national security information relative to the development of our nation's most critical warfighter programs. In the absence of this capability, DSS will divert resources to legacy systems which require menial data entry rather than meaningful security, counter-intelligence operations and analysis.\n\nFY18 Budget Request: represents a $2.5M decrease from the FY17 PB; the FY18 funding request of $4.6M is required to continue development of the Defense Security Service automated mission system capabilities overseeing the protection of classified information and technologies, and materials in the hands of cleared industry.  Continuous development activities are required to implement the DSS in Transition (DiT) initiatives to facilitate tailored, threat-driven security oversight and prioritized information sharing.  As DoD Security Enterprise continues to evolve, several critical missions have transitioned to DSS, which drives the need for continuous application refresh of existing as well as the acquisition of new advanced technologies in support of new missions.  A critical facet of DiT is Phase II of the National Industrial Security System (NISS) which will leverage event driven SIPR communications amongst DSS Components and external- organizations in lieu of schedule driven compliance.  NCAISS integration with NISS will ensure access to authorized individuals with the need to know are provided with timely and relevant information to respond on anticipated threats.  NCCS, the automated DD-254, will be updated to allow contractors and Government Contracting Authorities (GCAs) to review the full history of submissions for a more holistic view of security requirements and subcontractor relationships."

In compliance with the Expanded Electronic Government, President\u2019s Management Agenda, and the DoD Enterprise Architecture Framework, ESS is the unified offering of security mission systems which facilitate and automate improved national investigative and adjudicative standards, streamline security processes, and increase DoD community collaboration.\n\nThe DSS Mission Information Technology (IT) systems provide critical service to the major DSS mission areas for Industrial Security Oversight and Security Education.  DSS performs this critical function through operation of its mission production systems to include the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), the DSS Gateway, and the Security Training Education and Professionalization Portal (STEPP).  RDT&E for DSS mission systems primarily includes pre-planned product improvements to the applications, researching and improving assured information sharing to better posture systems and networks against vulnerabilities, ensuring self-defense of systems and networks, and safeguarding data at all stages for the DSS to increase efficiencies by providing web-based systems to manage certification and accreditation activities. These IT systems are as follows:   \n\nOffice of Designated Approving Authority (ODAA) Business Management System (OBMS).  The OBMS will automate the approval and certification process of cleared industry\u2019s classified information processing security plans and operations.  This will increase mission efficiency by providing a web-based system to manage certification and accreditation activities, provide improved reporting capabilities to support DSS and industry through improved metrics, accreditation timeliness and accuracy and reduce the number of unaccredited systems by providing automated notifications to DSS and industry.  \n\nEFCL:  The eFCL will be a centralized repository for information of facilities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). The eFCL will capture facility information relating to a cleared facility, from the initial processing of the facility clearance, the record decision pertaining to facility clearance request, to include Foreign Ownership Control or Influence (FOCI) information, as well as decommissioning the facility clearance, and capturing the DSS oversight activities.  The eFCL will provide a means for users to submit, update, search, and view facility verification requests.\n\nIndustrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  ISFD is the main DSS mission system that tracks and executes the National Industrial Security Program for DoD and 27 other Federal Executive Agencies of cleared industrial security facilities.  The ISFD provide users with a nationwide perspective on National Industrial Security Program related facilities, as well as, facilities under DSS oversight in the DoD conventional AA&E program. ISFD provides source data for the DoD Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and the Facility Verification Request (FVR) application.\n\nNational Industrial Security System (NISS, formerly known as Field Operations System (FOS).  The NISS is slated as the next generation enterprise capability, replacing the Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD).  Additionally, NISS will provide seamless integration of other DSS systems and applications, such as eFCL, OBMS, DD-254, and Mobile Workforce Applications.  NISS will provide DSS with comprehensive enhanced capability to manage its entire mission portfolio.  NISS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data in the hands of field representatives for decision-making.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  \n\nThe National Contract Classification System (NCCS).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires a DD Form 254 be incorporated in each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and classification guidance necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required to perform on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation\u2019s classified information is properly safeguarded.\n\n\nNational Industrial Security Program (NISP) Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) formerly known as Identity Management (IdM).  NCAISS is mandatory for compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program Management Office and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD-NII), Joint Task Force for Global Networks Operations (JTF-GNO) Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 06-02, CTO 07-015, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo 11-11 (M-11-11), directing accelerated use of PKI across the enterprise.  This initiative is designed to enable multiple DSS business systems to have service-accessibility that is controlled through PKI-compliant single sign-on authentication.  Potential expanded use of the NCAISS across the DSS enterprise to provide CAC-based authentication for business support applications to support the SIPRNet and JWICS domains, provide enhanced identity and access control analytics. It will also incorporate any remaining DSS operated application into the DSS NCAISS solution."

The $5.4M is required to meet the enterprise adoptability requirement goals for the platform.  The DITMAC and the systems that support it (DITMAC System of Systems (DSoS)) were scoped to enable processing of reports to DITMAC only. The commencement of operations of some DoD Component Insider Threat Programs in FY16 uncovered a lack of available technical capabilities.  A determination was made to offer the DSoS as the DoDs enterprise platform for insider threat related technical capabilities. The platform expansion requires a complete system re-architecture design to make the technical capabilities more readily accessible by related missions, increasing communication\/information sharing, decreasing cyber vulnerabilities, and cost savings each year in software licensing and technical support."

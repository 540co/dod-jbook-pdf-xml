This PE fosters innovation in Army niche areas (e.g., lightweight armor, energetic materials, and night vision capability) and areas where there is no commercial investment due to limited markets (e.g., vaccines for tropical diseases). It also focuses university single investigator research on areas of high interest to the Army (e.g., high-density compact power and novel sensor phenomenology). The in-house portion of the program capitalizes on the Army's scientific talent and specialized facilities to transition knowledge and technology into appropriate developmental activities. The extramural program leverages the research efforts of other government agencies, academia, and industry.  This PE also supports basic research at the Army laboratories through the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program.  The ILIR program serves as a catalyst for major technology breakthroughs by providing laboratory directors flexibility in implementing novel research ideas, by nurturing promising young scientists and engineers, and is used to attract and retain top doctoral degreed scientists and engineers. The ILIR program also provides a source of competitive funds for peer reviewed efforts at Army laboratories to stimulate high quality, innovative research with significant opportunity for payoff to Army warfighting capability.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This Project focuses on the fundamental underpinnings of aided and unaided target detection and identification techniques for land warfare scenarios.  This research enables Army systems that can act independently of the human operator to detect and track targets including clandestine tracking of non-cooperative targets.  Such capabilities are needed for smart munitions, unattended ground sensors, and as replacements for existing systems.  Critical technology issues include low depression angle, relatively short range, and highly competing background clutter.  The resulting research will provide a fundamental capability to predict, explain, and characterize target and background signature content, and reduce the workload on the analyst.  This research is aimed at determining the complexity and variability of target and clutter signatures and ultimately utilizing that knowledge to conceptualize and design advanced ATR paradigms to enhance robustness and effectiveness of land warfare systems.  ATR research strategies include emerging sensor modalities such as spectral and multi-sensor imaging.  Research in this Project builds knowledge for several technology efforts including multi-domain smart sensors, third generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and advanced multi-function laser radar (LADAR). \n\nWork is this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology) \/ Project 906 (Tactical Electronic Warfare Applied Research). \n \nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This research aims to generate new technologies for unprecedented battlefield situational awareness and to continue the dominance of Army units during night operations.  To achieve these objectives, IR focal plane arrays (FPAs) and lasers with significantly improved performance, lower cost, and increased operating temperatures are required.  This research has direct application to Army ground vehicles, aviation platforms, weapon systems, and the individual Soldier.  Research is focused on material growth, detector and laser design, and processing for large-area, multicolor IR FPAs, ultraviolet (UV) avalanche photodiodes (APDs), and mid-wavelength IR and UV lasers.  The principal efforts are directed towards novel materials for detectors and lasers, and investigating energy band-gap structures in semiconductor materials to enhance the performance of lasers, IR FPAs and UV APDs.  In the area of RF Photonics, near-IR modeling and nanofabrication techniques are applied to the design and fabrication of IR photonic-crystal waveguide structures having customized IR properties.  This research also is intended to lay the foundation for the development of integrated optoelectronic circuits using active and passive devices and components such as lasers, waveguides, and detectors in conjunction with fiber optic interconnects for the generation, distribution, processing, and control of microwaves.  The fundamental physics of signal processing and noise generation as well as the conversion between the time and frequency domains and the optical and electrical domains in these optoelectronic circuits\/systems will also be studied.  The technical goals are to: 1) manage and control defects in the raw, unprocessed materials, maintaining quality control in the fabrication of the devices and arrays, 2) limit introduction of impurities in the material, shielding device surfaces so that they are resistant to degradation over time and 3) thermal management, particularly as it applies to lasers.  In the area of Advanced Materials, the research is to investigate the fundamental physics of energy, charge, and spin transport along and across active heterogeneous interfaces such as topological insulators, van der Waals heterostructures, solid\/liquid interfaces, and bio\/a-bio interfaces, and in new materials to achieve new electronic\/optoelectronic device functionalities.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinning to PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology) \/ Project H95 (Night Vision and Electro-Optic Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The future Army will operate in very complex environments (e.g., urban, mountainous, forested and jungle terrain) requiring new approaches to understand, characterize, and depict environmental phenomena and their effects on military systems, personnel and operations.  The lack of a complete understanding of the meteorological aspects of the complex microscale boundary layer in which the Army operates continues to impact our ability to provide predictable, actionable, accurate and timely tactical environmental intelligence to battlefield commanders and small Soldier units.  This Project focuses on producing the foundational environmental science research to characterize the atmospheric boundary layer and deliver novel capabilities and techniques including urban turbulence characterization for its effects on micro platforms and sensor payloads, high resolution urban wind flow modeling for more efficient and accurate prediction of the transport and dispersion of obscurants and chemicals, battlefield aerosol characterization and the interaction between aerosols and meteorological processes for Soldier health initiatives, characterization and detection of bio-warfare agent aerosols, environmental effects on acoustic and electromagnetic signal propagation in urban and other complex domains for improved target location and imaging, exploration of previously unexploited regions of the acoustic and electro-magnetic spectrum, and formulation of objective analysis tools that can assimilate on-scene all-source weather observations, atmospheric composition, and fuse this information with forecasts to provide immediate Nowcast products and actionable information.  These capabilities will have a direct impact on ensuring Soldier survivability, weapon system lethality, effective surveillance and reconnaissance, and the mobility required for future warfighter mission planning and execution operations.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the theoretical underpinnings for PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology) \/ Project H71 (Meteorological Research for Battle Command).\n \nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Technical barriers include lack of methods for describing, measuring, modeling, analyzing and managing the interplay of these phenomena due to the dynamic nature of human behavior and to the situational complexity and ambiguity that characterize operations in the future force. Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements and enable neuroengineering. These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier-system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on cognitive and perceptual processes. In the area of translational neuroscience, which is the transition of basic neuroscience research to relevant applications, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. In the area of cybernetics, which is a scientific discipline that bridges the fields of control theory and communication theory for the study and modeling of behavior in complex systems, research is carried out to examine the complex human-system-environment relationships that define, constrain, and influence the interactions between Soldier and system. Research efforts are pursued to advance theory, models, and methodological approaches that capture the dynamic and multidimensional nature of human behavior, including the temporal dependencies inherent to human behavior, through an integrated program of research efforts focused on: novel cybernetic models of human multisensory integration and human-system communication; neuro-inspired, bio-inspired, and engineering approaches to computational algorithms for multisensory integration and multi-sensor fusion to enable enhanced and augmented Soldier perception in human-system interactions; new methodological approaches for the design of multisensory displays and human-system communications; and multisensory test bed platforms for examining experimental hypotheses driven by model predictions and proof-of-principle applications of identified algorithms and methods.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several PEs to include PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers) \/ Project H09 (Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance) and PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology) \/ H70 (Human Factors Engineering System Development).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements. These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier- system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on critical aspects of human-agent teaming. In the area of translational neuroscience, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential for application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. In the area of cybernetics, which is a scientific discipline that bridges the fields of control theory and communication theory for the study and modeling of behavior in complex systems, research is carried out to examine the complex human-system-environment relationships that define, constrain, and influence the interactions between Soldier and system. Research efforts are pursued to advance theory, models, and methodological approaches that capture the dynamic and multidimensional nature of human behavior, including the temporal dependencies inherent to human behavior, through an integrated program of research efforts focused on: novel cybernetic models of human multisensory integration and human-system communication; neuro-inspired, bio-inspired, and engineering approaches to computational algorithms for multisensory integration and multi-sensor fusion to enable enhanced and augmented Soldier perception in human-system interactions; new methodological approaches for the design of multisensory displays and human-system communications; and multisensory test bed platforms for examining experimental hypotheses driven by model predictions and proof-of-principle applications of identified algorithms and methods.\n\nThis Project also investigates innovative theories, models, and methods to improve personnel assessment, training, and leader development, as well as provide a better understanding of individual, unit, and organizational behavior and performance within the context of complex organizational and operational environments. The research within these domains will enable advances in psychometrics to support the development of the next generation of psychological assessments for selection, classification, and assignment. The research also will target how to improve the assessment of difficult-to-measure skills and enable theoretical advances to inform and support the accelerated development of complex cognitive and social skills. This research lays the foundation for future applications that address the behavioral and organizational dynamics that impact Army flexibility, effectiveness, and resilience.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This Project focuses on technical core competencies including: Materials from Biology; Biological\/Abiological Interfaces; Systems Biology; Computational Biology; Synthetic Biology, and how those competencies address Army needs to reduce logistics burden, increase situational awareness, and improve protection.  Research will advance from manipulation of single microorganisms to designed microbial consortia for conversion of flexible feedstocks (indigenous and waste) into consistent products for energy and agile\nexpedient manufacturing; advancing from the production of individual small molecules to gradient\/precision\/ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW)\/specialty materials for production of hierarchical and metamaterials for sensing and protection; and advance from laboratory use to ruggedized organisms and materials for field deployment enabling dynamic, responsive materials, advanced sensing, and materiel protection\/denial. Further, understanding the state-of-the-art in genetic engineering and control of biological systems in military environments will allow for understanding the pacing synthetic biology threat to the future operating environment.\n \nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command (AFC).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Research involves the study of new experimental capabilities to measure, characterize, and visualize complex phenomena with high temporal and spatial resolutions as well as the development of state-of-the-art computational models that provide predictive capabilities based on at-scale and cross-scale numerical frameworks that capture the relevant physical phenomena. Research in atmospheric science seeks an in-depth understanding of the complex atmospheric boundary layer associated with high-resolution meteorology, the transport, dispersion, optical properties and characterization of chemical and biological aerosols, the propagation of full-spectrum electro-magnetic and acoustic energy and physics-based multi-scale models for electronic, optical, mechanical, and chemical materials. Efforts seek to explore methodologies and computational capabilities for the quantification of uncertainty in predictive modeling enabling risk-informed decision analysis multi-scale material models and environmental impacts on complex Army systems (manned and unmanned). This research also conducts research in chemistry and physics controlling ballistic propulsion and launch; creating aerodynamic forces on flight bodies to permit radical maneuver at high speeds, and high altitude glide and flight maneuver for increased range of gun launched projectiles.  This research results in knowledge products that lead to new materials for armor and armaments, disruptive explosives and propellants, more accurate and non-lethal (NL)\/lethal projectiles and missiles, omnisonic maneuver of projectiles, and advanced armors for increased survivability of Army combat systems. This research also funds efforts in the characterization of chemical and biochemical phenomena occurring at or near solid surfaces and interfaces; the interactions between chemical reactions and transport processes on surfaces; theory and modeling of processes at complex surfaces; and the synthesis and characterization of catalysts that function at the nanoscale. Investment in basic research centered on the surface science disciplines will enable growth of a knowledge base that will result in improved understanding of the interactions of complex materials in real world environments.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings for several PEs to include PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology); 0602146A (Networks C3I Technology); 0602147A (Long Range Precision Fires); PE 0602141A (Lethality Technology), PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance. This research addresses the areas of information assurance, signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, information extraction from multi-modal data human-agent naturalistic communication, and intelligent systems for C4I. Research will focus on understanding and solving inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at the edge, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, and information warfare threats. These C4I technologies must accommodate heterogeneous security infrastructures, multi-service and multi-national interoperability, and information exchange\/security mechanisms between multiple levels of security. The intelligent systems for C4I research focuses on providing machine learning methods to overcome noisy, sparse and heterogeneous data with artificial intelligence algorithms that can transfer learning from one domain to another. This foundational research will produce help identifying highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and Soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the theoretical underpinnings for PE 0602146A (Networks C3I Technology), 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) and 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.  \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Problems addressed include the need for greater fuel efficiency and reduced weight in these propulsion systems.  Technical barriers to advanced propulsion systems are the inadequacy of existing materials to safely withstand higher temperature demands, the lack of capability to accurately simulate the flow physics and the mechanical behavior of these systems, including the engine and drive train.  The Army is the lead Service in these technology areas and performs basic research in propulsion, as applicable to rotorcraft as well as tracked and wheeled vehicles.  Technical solutions are being pursued through analysis, code generation, and evaluations to improve engine and drive train components and investigate advanced materials.  Component level investigations include compressors, combustors, turbines, energy sources and conversion, injectors, pistons, cylinder liners, piston rings, gears, seals, bearings, shafts, and controls.\n\nWork in this Project provides the technical underpinnings for PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The current methodology of using materials to gain added functionality for Army systems is to use a layered approach, whereby each layer provides added capability (e.g., ballistic, chemical\/biological, signature, etc.), but ultimately makes the system too heavy and too expensive.  Technical solutions are being pursued through understanding the fundamental aspects of chemistry and microstructure that influence the performance and failure mechanisms of ceramics, advanced polymer composites, and advanced metals, with the goal of creating hierarchically organized materials systems that possess multifunctional attributes at greatly reduced weight and cost.  These advanced materials will enable revolutionary lethality and survivability technologies for the future. \n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings for several PEs to include PE 0602105A (Materials Technology) \/ Project H84 (Materials) and PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology) \/ H98 (Clothing & Equipment Technology). \n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance.  This research supports the Army's Network Science initiative and addresses the areas of information assurance, signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, document and speech machine translation, and intelligent systems for C4I.  Major barriers to achieving the goals are the inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at lower echelons, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, new low-density languages, and information warfare threats.  These C4I technologies must accommodate heterogeneous security infrastructures and information exchange\/security mechanisms between multiple levels of security.  The intelligent systems for C4I research focuses on providing the agent technology capabilities that will produce highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and Soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology) \/ Project Y10 (Computer\/Information Science Technology).\n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This research also enables the design and use of composite structures that can better address the cost, weight, performance, and dynamic interaction requirements of future platforms identified by the Army Modernization Strategy.  Ultimately, these technologies result in safer, more affordable vehicles with a greatly reduced logistics footprint.  This Project is a collaborative Army and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) effort that includes structures technology research into: structural integrity analyses; failure criteria; inspection methods which address fundamental technology deficiencies in both metallic and composite Army rotorcraft structures; use of composite materials in the design and control of structures through structural tailoring techniques; rotorcraft aeroelastic modeling and simulation; helicopter vibration (rotating and fixed systems); and the design and analyses of composite structures with crashworthiness as a goal.  The problems in structural modeling are inaccurate structural analysis and validation methods to predict durability and damage tolerance of composite and metallic rotorcraft structures and inadequate structural dynamics modeling methods for both the rotating and fixed system components to address reliability issues for future aircraft.  The technical barriers include a lack of understanding of failure mechanisms, damage progression, residual strength, high-cycle fatigue, the transfer of aerodynamic loads on the rotor to the fixed system, and impact of these unknown loads on aircraft components.  Technical solutions are focused on: advanced fatigue methodologies for metallic structures, improved composites technology throughout the vehicle, long-term investigation of integrated stress-strength-inspection, advanced methods for rotor system vehicle vibratory loads prediction, improved methods to predict vehicle stability, and improved analyses to address Army Aviation requirements.  These advancements will extend service life, reduce maintenance costs, enhance durability, and reduce the logistics footprint of existing and future Army vehicles.  This is the only basic research Project supporting investigations for rotorcraft and ground vehicle structures within the Department of Defense.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology). \n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Work in pollution prevention invests in next generation manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal methods that will result in significantly reducing the usage of hazardous and toxic substances and their associated costs.  The goal is to decrease the overall life-cycle costs of Army systems by 15-30% through the application of advanced pollution prevention technologies.  Non-stockpile CW efforts include establishing the ecotoxicity of CW compounds, environmental fate and effect of CW compounds in soils and biodegradation of CW compounds.  Pollution prevention thrusts include: environmentally acceptable, advanced, non-toxic processes to manufacture lightweight alternative structural materials to enhance weapon system survivability; clean synthesis of more powerful and improved energetic compounds to eliminate the use of hazardous materials and minimize the generation of wastes; and surface protection alternatives to hazardous paints, cadmium, chromium, and chromate conversion metal and composite surfaces.  \n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the Army Environmental Requirements Technology Assessment (AERTA) requirements and contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments.  \n\nThe cited work provides the technical underpinnings for PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology).\n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This effort seeks to better understand the biology of malaria and leishmaniasis (a skin-based disease transmitted by sand flies predominantly exhibited as skin sores) parasites and to gain the necessary foundation for discovering medical countermeasures to protect military personnel from infection. Because the malaria parasite becomes resistant to drugs over time, it is necessary to continually search for parasite weaknesses that can be exploited by different drugs and vaccines. This effort seeks to better understand small molecule therapeutics and prophylactics, to overcome drug resistant organisms and identify new proteins in the design of candidate vaccines for various types of malaria including the severe form (caused by Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (caused by Plasmodium vivax)."

It enables future systems to support and unburden Soldiers by integrating technologies with an understanding of cognitive and physical needs, and the missions of the humans and (non-human) agents operating on the battlefield.  The ability of the Warfighter to command a suite of small unmanned systems (e.g., air, ground, and hybrid vehicles) reduces exposure of the Soldier to harm and improves the efficiency by which a dismounted unit achieves tactical objectives such as securing a targeted zone.  Example missions requiring enhanced autonomy, manipulation, and man-portability include rapid room clearing and interior structure mapping; detection of human presence, chemical\/biological\/nuclear\/radiological\/explosive (CBNRE), and booby-traps; surveillance; and subterranean passage detection and exploration.  Because of their relatively small size, light weight, and service in dismounted environments, small unmanned systems have unique challenges in perception, autonomous processing, mobility mechanics, propulsive power, and multi-functional packaging that transcend similar challenges associated with large unmanned systems.  The Army Futures Command  conducts research in related disciplines, including machine perception, intelligent control, biomimetic robotics, manipulator mechanics, and propulsive power and drives to foster the development of technologies for lightweight, small-volume, robotics applications for harsh environments.  Machine perception research includes the exploration of lightweight ultra-compact sensor phenomenology and the maturation of basic machine vision algorithms that enable small unmanned systems to more fully understand their local environment.  Intelligent control research includes the maturation of autonomous processing capabilities and the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques that lead to reliable autonomous behavior in a large-displacement, highly-dynamic environment and permit unmonitored task performance.  Research in biomimetic robotics and manipulator mechanics includes the advancement of mechatronic and biomimetic appendages to enable agile high-speed locomotion, dexterous task-performance, and environmental-manipulation; and the maturing of nonlinear control algorithms to support robust, stable mobility. Propulsion power research includes investigations of engine cycles and alternative hybrid energy conversion techniques to provide compact, lightweight, quiet, low-emission, high-density power sources that support highly-portable unmanned systems capable of performing long-endurance missions.  \n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The MURI program funds university based basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining land combat technology superiority. Army MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high-priority, transformational topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline (e.g., Intelligent Luminescence for Communication, Display, and Identification). For many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application.  The DURIP provides funds to acquire major research equipment to augment current, or devise new, research capabilities in support of Army transformational research. The PECASE program funds single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.  \n\nWork in this PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The MURI program funds university based basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining land combat technology superiority. Army MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high- priority, transformational topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline (e.g. Intelligent Luminescence for Communication, Display, and Identification). For many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application.  The DURIP provides funds to acquire major research equipment to augment current, or devise new, research capabilities in support of Army transformational research. The PECASE program funds single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.\n\nWork in this Project provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Broadly, the work in this PE falls into the categories of Collaborative Technology Alliances \/ Collaborative Research Alliances (CTAs\/CRAs), University Centers of Excellence (COE), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), Army-sponsored educational outreach, and Army investments at international academic and industrial partners. The Army formed CTAs to leverage large investments by the commercial sector in basic research areas that are of great interest to the Army. CTAs are industry-led partnerships between industry, academia, and the Army Futures Command to incorporate the practicality of industry, the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge from universities, and Army scientists to shape, mature, and transition technology relevant to the Army mission. CRAs are academia-led partnerships, which leverage the cutting-edge innovation found in the academic environment. The COEs focus on expanding the frontiers of knowledge in research areas where the Army has enduring needs, and couples state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to increase the supply of scientists and engineers in automotive and rotary wing technology. Also included are Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) and activities to stimulate interest in science, math, and technology among middle and high school students. This PE includes support for basic research at three Army UARCs, which have been created to exploit opportunities to advance new capabilities through a sustained long- term multidisciplinary effort. The Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies focuses on Soldier protection by emphasizing revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability. The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies focuses on enabling network centric-technologies, and broadening the Army's use of biotechnology for the development of bio-inspired materials, sensors, and information processing. The Institute for Creative Technologies is a partnership with academia and the entertainment and gaming industries to leverage innovative research and concepts for training and simulation. Examples of specific research of mutual interest to the entertainment industry and the Army are technologies for realistic immersion in synthetic environments, networked simulation, standards for interoperability, and tools for creating simulated environments. This PE also includes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institution (HBCU\/MI) Centers of Excellence that address critical research areas for Army Transformation.\n\nFY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The PRI Program was established as the next phase of what was previously known as Partnership in Research Transition (PIRT) Program that ended in FY16. The focus of the PRI Program is to advance innovative basic research leading to potential technology development in areas of strategic importance to the Army by bringing competitively selected HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions (MIs) research teams into existing Army Futures Command Collaborative Research Alliances (CRAs) and Collaborative Technology Alliances (CTAs). The CTAs and CRAs are large collaborative centers focused on developing and transitioning research in Army critical areas. Army UARCs have been created to exploit opportunities to advance new capabilities through a sustained long- term multidisciplinary effort. The Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies focuses on Soldier protection by emphasizing revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability. The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies focuses on enabling network centric-technologies, and broadening the Army's use of biotechnology for the development of bio-inspired materials, sensors, and information processing. The Institute for Creative Technologies is a partnership with academia and the entertainment and gaming industries to leverage innovative research and concepts for training and simulation. Examples of specific research of mutual interest to the entertainment industry and the Army are technologies for realistic immersion in synthetic environments, networked simulation, standards for interoperability, and tools for creating simulated environments. The COEs focus on expanding the frontiers of knowledge in research areas where the Army has enduring needs, and couples state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to increase the supply of scientists and engineers in automotive and rotary wing technology.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

CTAs and CRAs are partnerships between Army laboratories and centers, private industry, and academia that focus on the rapid transition of innovative technologies to the Warfighter to enable the Army's Future Force. The collaboration between industry, academia and the government is a key element of the alliance concept as each member brings with it a distinctly different approach to research. Academia is known for its cutting-edge innovation; the industrial partners are able to leverage existing research results for transition and to deal with technology bottlenecks; the Army Futures Command researchers keep the program oriented toward solving complex Army technology problems. This approach enables an Alliance to bring together world class research and development talent and focus it on Army-specific technology objectives for application to Army needs. The topics covered by CRAs and CTAs include cyber security (funded in PE 0601121A (Cyber Collaborative Research Alliance)), the internet of battlefield things, distributed and collaborative intelligent systems technology, neuroergonomics and neuroscience, advanced materials, exploitation of quantum effects, and machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The nine ITCs located in North America, South America, Asia, and Europe support the Army's goals of providing the best technology in the world to our Warfighters by leveraging the Science and Technology (S&T) investments of our international partners. The ITCs perform identification and evaluation of international technology programs to assess their potential impact on the Army's S&T investment strategy. ITC 'technology finds' are submitted to various Army S&T organizations for evaluation and consideration for further research and development. Highly promising research will be awarded seed funding by the ITC through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. The FTAS program also builds upon the technology finds submitted by the ITCs. In some cases the find is truly unique and may well meet an Army requirement or potentially support ongoing Army S&T investments. In such cases, the FTAS program can provide initial resources (seed money) to determine the appropriateness of these technology areas identified as having potential relevance to the Army. These efforts will provide information useful in making early assessments of the technology's potential contributions to the Army's S&T strategy.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.  This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network.  The three aspects of cyber that are addressed are: 1) vulnerabilities and risks of cyber networks to malicious activities, 2) anticipating, detecting, and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities.  Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security.  The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology) \/ Project H92 (Communications Technology). \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Escalating levels of complexity and uncertainty on the current and future battlefield present conditions which have never existed before now.  Solution strategies and approaches must be developed or tailored.  The emerging field of neuroergonomics, which seeks to understand the brain at work and to leverage that understanding to optimize system design, offers tremendous potential for providing the solutions needed to meet the needs of Army forces in the future.  This CTA addresses the solution strategies and approaches needed to design systems to fully exploit investments in revolutionary technological advances in areas such as robotics, microelectronics, and computer and network information systems.  These technologies present significant opportunities to enhance Army mission capabilities, but impose significant burdens on the human brain, which will ultimately limit Soldier-system effectiveness, sustainability, and survivability.  The technical barriers associated with this project include: immature knowledge base to guide the neuroergonomic approach to human-system integration; inadequate capabilities to sense and extract information about brain activity in dynamic, operational environments; lack of valid measures to robustly and uniquely characterize operationally-relevant cognitive performance; lack of techniques for integrating advanced understandings of brain activity into systems designs, including real-time use of measures of cognitive behavior as system inputs and the capability to account for individual differences in maximizing Soldier-system performance.  This CTA conducts an intensive and accelerated program to formulate, validate, and transition basic research findings through multi-dimensional approaches focused in three areas: understanding fundamental principles underlying Soldier neurocognitive performance in operational environments, advancing computational approaches for the analysis and interpretation of neural functioning, and fundamental advancement in neurotechnologies that enhance Soldier-system interactions and performance. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The DCIST CRA focuses on systems with a large number of heterogeneous intelligent agents, including Soldiers that can be distributed over large areas and are required to move through contested environments and against peer capabilities at op-tempo. To meet these goals innovative research is performed in three main technical areas: distributed intelligence, large heterogeneous group control, and adaptive and resilient behaviors. The payoff to the warfighter will be extended reach, situational awareness, and operational effectiveness against dynamic threats in contested environments, and technical and operational superiority through intelligent, resilient and collaborative behaviors of Soldiers and intelligent systems.

The CRA will comprise academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of phenomena of Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems in tactically relevant environments. The CRA will facilitate collaboration across organizations to provide multi-disciplinary perspectives on basic research challenges, as well as the use of state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations. This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of pervasive and converged cyber- physical complex information systems and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the information-theoretic and human elements of Army IoBT interactions. The three aspects of the emergent Internet of Battlefield Things topical areas addressed are: 1) dynamic discovery and adaptation of cyber- physical devices, networks, and information sources, 2) resilient re-purposing and re-tasking of devices and information capabilities, and 3) algorithmic, distributed and centralized information-stream processing. Overarching goals of the basic research on Army IoBT are to investigate foundational cross-cutting theories and methods leading towards a science of heterogeneous, self-adapting, complex cyber-physical systems. This research will lead to optimized real-time adversarial situation estimates in information-enabled warfare and greatly enhance the speed and precision for complex military operations involving converged sensing, communications, and resilient actuation.\n\nWork in this Project builds fundamental knowledge for and accelerates the transition of communications and networks technology to PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The NS CTA performs foundational, cross-cutting network science research leading to: a fundamental understanding of the interplay and common underlying science among social\/cognitive, information, and communications networks; determination of how processes and parameters in one network affect and are affected by those in other networks; and prediction and control of the individual and composite behavior of these complex interacting networks.  This research will lead to optimized human performance in network-enabled warfare and greatly enhanced speed and precision for complex military operations.  The CTA facilitates the exchange of people among the collaborating organizations to provide cross-organizational perspectives on basic research challenges, as well as the use of state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations. Many of the results of the NS CTA provide a foundation for the Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance  that began in FY18. \n\nWork in this Project builds fundamental knowledge for and accelerates the transition of communications and networks technology to Program Element (PE) 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology).  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

ICT applies the results of this research and proves its value in Army relevant applications such as training, mission rehearsal, leadership development, cultural awareness, negotiation, health and medical, and distance learning.  The ICT actively performs research and engages industry and academic institutions internationally to incorporate the latest research results and hardware and software into its research program and application development and exploit dual-use technology. The ICT serves as a means for the military to learn about, benefit from, and facilitate the transfer of applicable technologies into military systems.  In addition the ICT works with creative talent from the entertainment industry to advance and leverage techniques and capabilities and adapt concepts of story and character to increase the degree of participant immersion in synthetic environments in order to improve the realism and usefulness of these experiences.  In developing a true synthesis of the creativity, research, technology, and capability of industry and the research and development community, the ICT is revolutionizing capabilities for the Army by making it more effective in terms of cost, time, range of experiences and the quality of the result and by producing research and applications that will benefit the Army of the 21st century. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The ISN emphasizes revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The ISN works in close collaboration with the United States (US) Army Futures Command as well as several major industrial partners, including Raytheon and DuPont, in pursuit of its goals.  This Project emphasizes revolutionary materials research toward an advanced uniform concept.  The future uniform will integrate a wide range of functionality, including ballistic protection, responsive passive cooling and insulating, screening of chemical and biological agents, biomedical monitoring, performance enhancement, and extremities protection.  The objective is to lighten the Soldier's load through system integration and multifunctional devices while increasing survivability.  The new technologies will be compatible with other Soldier requirements, including Soldier performance, limited power generation, integrated sensors, communication and display technologies, weapons systems, and expected extremes of temperature, humidity, storage lifetimes, damage, and spoilage. \n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

These activities are coordinated within the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) that links and networks appropriate components to derive the best synergies to present the Army to a larger pool of technical talent and to provide students with Army-unique practical experiences at Army laboratories, centers, and institutes and expose them to DoD careers. AEOP increases interest and involvement of students and teachers across the nation in STEM at all proficiency levels and backgrounds to include under-represented and economically disadvantaged groups through exposure to Army sponsored research, education, competitions, internships, and practical experiences. This Project utilizes Army STEM assets to contribute to a STEM literate citizenry as well as enhances the national pool of science and engineering personnel that in turn supports defense industry and Army laboratory and research, development, and engineering center needs.\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments. This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network. The three aspects of cyber that are addressed are: 1) vulnerabilities and risks of cyber networks to malicious activities, 2) anticipating, detecting, and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities. Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security. The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy."

This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly to develop a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments. This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network. The three aspects of cyber that are addressed are: 1) adaptive reasoning for deception, 2) anticipating, detecting, and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities. Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security. The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Futures Command."

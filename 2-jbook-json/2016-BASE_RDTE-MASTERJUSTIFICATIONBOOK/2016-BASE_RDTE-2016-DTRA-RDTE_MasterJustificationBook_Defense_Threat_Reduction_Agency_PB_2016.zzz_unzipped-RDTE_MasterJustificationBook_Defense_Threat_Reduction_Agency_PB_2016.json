This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E), these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, the DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet the principal objectives of the above referenced documents.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. \n\nThe Basic Research Initiative provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers comprised from academia and world-class research institutions in Government and industry.  This leverages the DoD's $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions and by improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts.  These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA\u2019s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a chemical\/biological basic research program under DoD\u2019s Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  DTRA\u2019s research interests are coordinated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Services\u2019 basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technological areas which are not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.\n\nDTRA\u2019s Basic Research portfolio supports several National and DoD initiatives directly related to Countering WMD (CWMD) including: Office of Science and Technology Policy Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY 2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY 2014;  Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap;  2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and science and technology (S&T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential foes, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based or inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under Project RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD. Details are provided in the R-2a exhibit."

This leverages the Department of Defense's (DoD's) $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting weapons of mass destruction (WMD) related defense missions and by improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts.  These efforts are closely coordinated with the DTRA\u2019s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department initiatives which execute a chemical\/biological basic research program under the DoD Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  The DTRA\u2019s research interests are coordinated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Services\u2019 basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technological areas which are not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.\n\nThis project supports several national and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD including: Office of Science and Technology Policy, Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY 2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY 2014; Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap; 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&T) investments that support Countering WMD (CWMD) and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements. Specific activities for Project RU include: Sensing and Recognition \u2013 Generation of information that provides knowledge of the presence, identity, and\/or quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant; Network Sciences \u2013 Enhance fundamental knowledge of theory, representations, and mapping to improve the WMD-related robustness, resiliency, recovery of, and informational and operational utility associated with and derived from, complex disparate but interdependent networks; Protection Sciences \u2013 Advance knowledge for protection of personnel, resources, sensitive systems and infrastructure from WMD; Sciences to Defeat WMD \u2013 Phenomena that improves success of defeat actions (use of weapons) including explosives, accessing and defeating target WMDs, such as biological agents and weapons modeling; and Sciences to Secure WMD \u2013 Improve understanding of phenomena for verification and compliance with treaties, including test detection.  Additional activities for Project RU include the discovery of revolutionary control methods to monitor and secure components, materials, and weapons, and disrupt proliferation pathways; and cooperative research with global partners \u2013 research to reduce the global threat of WMD in collaboration with a broad range of international partners. Finally, this project supports and administers the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program for academic engagements which has the core goals of securing dangerous pathogens, promoting open and active disease reporting and response, advancing transparent research to understand pathogens, and developing potential countermeasures.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 reflects a reduced effort in combating WMD basic research resulting in reductions to the number of active basic research awards.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 maintains the investment in basic research to keep pace with inflation."

This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E), these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2006 National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. \n\nA focused and strong WMD threat reduction technology base is critical to meeting these objectives.  This technology base is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up DTRA\u2019s combat support mission.  DTRA's has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.\n\nActivities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support the prevention and adversary use of WMD through the development of technology to locate and identify nuclear threats, post-detonation forensics, and treaty verification.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental Counter-WMD (CWMD) research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems, and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund the development of tools for the DTRA Technical Reachback analysis center which supports United States and allied forces, interagency, and civil authorities with 24 hour\/7 days per week Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) event analysis support."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This project achieves its goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons delivery systems for rapid WMD elimination.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Counter-WMD (CWMD) technologies.\n\nThe project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in component demonstrations and sub-scale and field testing of WMD defeat and assessment technologies."

The Nuclear Survivability project provides electromagnetic pulse (EMP) research and standards, Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation, advanced Radiation Hardened Microelectronics (RHM), and human survivability research.  The research from this project supports the 487 mission critical systems identified under DoDI 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.\n\nDTRA is the DoD designated EMP center of excellence to provide electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments to support national and military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and national strategic system designs.  DTRA publishes nuclear related military standards and handbooks for the strategic and non-strategic warfighters and program offices as the DoD NWE subject matter expert.\n\nThe RHM program responds to DoD space and missile system requirements for nanoelectronics and photonics technology to support DoD strategic mission needs.  This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype microelectronics to ensure their availability from both private sector and government organizations. Further, the program develops DoD space and satellite nuclear survivability standards and handbooks that provide engineering level detail and defined metrics for all entities with space asset equities.\n\nPulsed power and laser-driven NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct radiation effects research in materials and electronics, and validate computational models.  The Experimental Capabilities Program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the United Kingdom's (UK) Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.\n\nHuman survivability conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapons effects in urban environments.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in nuclear effects simulation\/experimentation capability and radiation hardened nanoelectronics.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of the system vulnerabilities and assessment activities from Project RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects to Project RI."

The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates\/modifies software to more accurately model and simulate weapons effects on WMD and related targets.  These efforts will lead to advanced capabilities in countering WMD planning tools.  The Advanced Energetics Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed, and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD\/Hard and Deeply Buried Targets. The Advanced Energetics Program develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast\/frag warhead technology.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in small and medium-scale validation and parametric study experiments for advanced energetics.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to decreased investment in weapons effects modeling."

It leverages 50 years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The project provides capabilities that support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard and Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the cancellation of the Infrastructure Development and Improvement program to balance priorities."

This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2002 National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities.\n\nThe Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat program element reduces WMD proliferation and enhances WMD defeat capabilities through advanced technology development.  To accomplish this objective, the DTRA established the following projects:  RA-Information Sciences and Applications, RD-Detection Technologies, RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF-Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01)."

This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support assessment and estimation of WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.  This project has also provided support (through FY 2014) to international CWMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts. \n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to the completion of efforts in building partner capacity development activities.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency\u2019s research and development mitigates these challenges by enabling Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction efforts through advancing radiation detection capabilities.  There are physical limits to the efficacy of traditional radiation detection, and the successful recovery or interdiction of a weapon may depend on detection capabilities that apply much earlier in the nuclear threat chain continuum.  The nuclear threat chain continuum can be defined as the entire spectrum of activities that might lead to the state loss or violent extremist organization acquisition of a nuclear weapon.  Beginning FY 2016, Project RD will conduct research, development, test, & evaluation (RDT&E) to 1) advance detection\u2014both sensor technology and related methodologies\u2014for signatures\/indicators associated with nuclear threat enablers such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique materials in order to advance U.S. Government capabilities to detect and interdict such threats; and 2) locate, identify, and track Special Nuclear Material by integrating new technologies into detection systems and delivering prototypes for evaluation and further procurement by Services\/Special Mission Units. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter\/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the subdivision of Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies into projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016."

This high priority project focuses on support to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Through enhancing USSOCOM capabilities, this project supports the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force.  The following efforts are included:\n\nThe CWMD-T technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers at multiple nodes along the terrorist development\/acquisition pathway in order to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces.\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation research and development (R&D) program is a collaborative effort with USSOCOM in which DTRA manages and sub-allocates a portion of this funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM\u2019s counterterrorism and counterproliferation mission.  New counterterrorism and counterproliferation technologies are developed under USSOCOM management, and in coordination with DTRA, to provide warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.\n\nUnder Project RE, the USSOCOM CWMD-T Support Program integrates and federates all-source intelligence and other information with operational analysis to support Combatant Command (CCMD) planning processes related to CWMD-T.  Research is focused on developing and improving technologies to ingest, organize, interpret, and operationalize large amounts of data from many sources, multiple formats, and all relevant classification levels to provide the warfighter with a dynamic picture of the WMD-T operational environment.\n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investments in technology solutions supporting operations in subterranean environments.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the deferment of lower priority projects until further maturation in technology readiness level."

Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on- and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring, and confidence-building requirements.  Prior to FY 2016, Project RF included funding to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats.

Efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter\/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to reduced investment in novel advanced nuclear\/radiological detection technologies and restructuring DoD-relevant monitoring and verification activities in support of the DoD proliferation monitoring mission. The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The project addresses defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The project addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Service requirements documents, and Combatant Command and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) capability.\n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investment in CWMD Hard Target Defeat Weapons Technologies.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment to build and conduct the initial full-scale testing of the Next Generation of CWMD weapon concept."

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) provides subject matter expertise for the dose reconstructions.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.\n\nThe Mighty Guardian force-on-force tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Military Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage, and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to the Services' procurement.\n\nNuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the Department of Defense (DoD) Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Military Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and loss of assured safety due to accidents, fires, or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of CCMDs and Military Services.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to the net impact of increased investment in stockpile logistics and decreased investment in nuclear surety in FY 2015.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in the nuclear surety program."

The two major components of this project are: (1) WMD battlespace awareness and (2) counter WMD (CWMD) weapons effects and planning tools.  WMD battlespace awareness efforts seek to provide warfighters with capabilities to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats.  This project provides capabilities through the development and integration of multi-mission Unmanned Aerial Systems payloads to emplace sensing technologies, and remotely sense, identify, track, and target WMD-related threats; and, through the development and integration of low visibility, stand-off, and man-portable chemical agent and biological agent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies to sense, identify, track, target, and assess WMD-related threats. The CWMD weapons effects and planning tools effort develops modernized, fast-running, and validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to aid Combatant Commanders\u2019 targeting and aid weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM to Project RA-Information Sciences and Applications."

It may be possible or preferable to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for both the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the Intelligence Community (IC), the analytical tools and processes required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs; and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY2015 was due to increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive mission critical technology gap.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the continuing increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software."

This mission directly aligns with several National and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents. For Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. \n\nThis program element supports the development of system capabilities for the countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) mission.  This funding specifically supports technologies to meet International Monitoring System technology requirements in support of nuclear arms control activities under the Nuclear Arms Control Technology program. Through FY 2014, funding also supported the development of collaborative CWMD analysis capabilities between the DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework in the form of the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset."

This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.  \n  \nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams. \n \nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests.  The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is for an enhanced level of investment in research on radionuclide sampling and analytical capabilities."

Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrated legacy capabilities and facilitated data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provided near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between the Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.  This toolset migrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Combating WMD decision support capabilities. The framework was the only operational chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) framework in the world that provided capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by international, National, state, and local authorities.  \n\nThe decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments."

AT21 Theater Capability, through the implementation of process improvements, integration of commercial transportation management and optimization tools, and development of additional deployment and distribution supporting technology, will provide the capability for combatant commanders to manage theater operations with improved visibility and control for those transportation movements originating from the port of debarkation and delivered to the point of need."

AT21 Theater Capability, through the implementation of process improvements, integration of commercial transportation management and optimization tools, and development of additional deployment and distribution supporting technology, will provide the capability for combatant commanders to manage theater operations with improved visibility and control for those transportation movements originating from the port of debarkation and delivered to the point of need."

DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate \u2013 including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies, as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLA\u2019s Research and Development (R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the Agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources, and applying most effective business processes.  The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  \n\nIn December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&D program in support of the Agency\u2019s efforts to achieve its\u2019 mission.  As a result, the R&D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to   Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support DLA\u2019s efforts to achieve the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness and continue fiscal stewardship while supporting the Department\u2019s transition to peacetime operations."

The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. In addition, emerging additive manufacturing technology will not be available for low volume parts.  The Strategic Distribution and Reutilization reductions mean that DLA support to the COCOM\u2019s deployments will be more costly because they will not be able to access regional suppliers through the IBEX2 system.  Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available.  Finally, the reductions to the Defense Logistics Information project means DLA will not be capable of taking advantage of major advancements in Computer Aided Design\/Computer Aided Manufacturing.   \n\nFY2016 \u2013 FY2020 Restructuring: In December 2013, the DLA Director called for changes to the R&D program that would allow greater flexibility to support the Agency\u2019s mission.  As a result, the R&D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to a few overarching Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support its efforts to achieve the needed improvements in order to maintain mission readiness and fiscal stewardship as the Department continues transition to peacetime operations. The three Strategic Focus Areas are: \n\n1. Analytic and Decision Support:  R&D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced analytical tools, modeling, and simulation of logistics and supply chain processes.  These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible response to emerging market and customer requirements. \n2. Logistics Processes: R&D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced technology in the internal DLA logistics processes. To qualify for R&D funding, the R&D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. \n3. Innovative Products and Services for Customers: R&D efforts undertaken to develop new products and services for DLA customers including helping to achieve the operational energy strategy goals of increasing sources of supply, developing and implementing alternative fuels and emerging,  out of cycle requirements that always occur and new products and services developed by DLA.  \n\nFY2016 \u2013 FY2020  Reprogramming to Industrial Preparedness \u2013 Manufacturing Technology Program (P.E. 0708011S) \nThis change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems.  The MBE is important because much of the data currently developed during the design and production weapon system life cycle is lost and has to be recreated."

This change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems. \n\nThe Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high-payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products.  The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA\u2019s) strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation\u2019s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are: 1.) Development of Logistics Data Interoperability & Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and\/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer\u2019s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.\n\nDLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only. They are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support."

Planning processes model and simulate item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories and acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items).  Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies.  The Distribution\/Disposition thrust will develop, and implement analytical tools, models, and simulations of logistics and supply chain processes related to distribution and disposition."

It will expand the number of tent and shelter products that have rich technical and performance information available on DOD EMALL. The project is structured to benefit the entire tent manufacturing community by making their product more visible and, more importantly, it will improve the quality of product information available to the warfighter.  Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  \n\nExtension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA\u2019s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.  Anticipate completion by Sept 2011."

To qualify for R&D funding, the R&D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. \nThis strategic focus area has 4 thrusts: Technical\/Quality Process Improvements, Selected Process Improvements, Medical Processes, and Distribution\/Disposition Processes.  \n\nT\/Q process improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters.  Specifically, Cost of Quality processes, increasing use of DOD organic manufacturing capabilities, reduction of ESA reviews caused by Critical Item Reviews.\n\nSelected process improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical\/Quality (T\/Q) Function including identifying improved methods for improving support for Low demand parts, accurate material receipt processes and eCommerce and catalog items as an alternative to stocking items.  \n\nMedical Processes will expand work in critical mechanisms to guarantee product quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel distributed to our customers, and identify the most efficient and cost-effective means to deliver those medical products in accordance with FDA-labeled and other regulatory requirements.  \n\nDistribution and Disposition logistics processes deal with improving distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency. While numerous technologies and applications have been developed and exploited, DLA has not kept pace with the commercial industry in regards to modernizing its technology systems infrastructure, processes, or mobilizing information for personnel, customers, and processes."

These enhancements will greatly improve map services to the warfighter while significantly reducing lead times and lowering overhead costs attributed to printing, storage and shipping.  The POD Project will require an RMD to transfer funds to a new program element prior to the PB16 submission."

To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information and invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success and help ensure the viability of our capabilities and implementation of a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes and the ability to effectively collaborate\/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote effective, efficient and responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources."

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations\/analytics, distribution demand forecasting\/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations.  Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro\/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct \"what -if\" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset\u2019s course, speed or departure\/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery\/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.

                                                        "val": "The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks, such as, counterfeiting, Trojan horses, unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities increases.\n\nMicroelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department\u2019s particular needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. In these cases, DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department\u2019s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source.\n\nDMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA\u2019s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions\u2014along with its unique technical perspective\u2014allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.\n\nWorking alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA\u2019s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry\u2019s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners\u2019 valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner\u2019s IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.\n\nDMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities."

These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department\u2019s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department\u2019s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, the development of trusted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and the extension of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands.\n\nToday\u2019s weapon systems experience extended field operations and\/or are required to remain in service beyond planned replacements, driving the need for growth in DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing these systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset."

Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical\/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities that might be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. This trend is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other areas of defense interest, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.\n\nThe Trusted Microelectronics program provides the Department and NSA with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The NSA Trusted Access Program Office has successfully contracted with commercial sources to satisfy their state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department\/ and NSA systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Microelectronics access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies."

The goals of BEIS are to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports\/statements based on standardized data.  BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:\n- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.\n- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.\n- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.\n- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).\nThe BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business, four of which have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The remaining two services, Financial Reporting Services and Cash Accountability Reporting Services, will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility and will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports, as well as Treasury Reporting.  The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  These modernization efforts will complete deployment\/implementation of BEIS capabilities and will serve the Department Auditability goals and objectives."

These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database\/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD\/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components\/services: DCD\/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center."

The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRPTA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and GAO recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce.  \n\nAs a secure, end-to-end IT system, the DISS will be the authoritative source for the management, storage, and timely dissemination of and access to personnel security, HSPD-12, and suitability information and will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DOD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies.  \n\nThe DISS family of systems is comprised of two components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS).  Once fully deployed, the DISS family of systems will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System, which contains approximately six million active security clearance records and supports over 80,000 users.  The DISS has also been designated as the repository for adjudicative results for Suitability and HSPD-12 determinations by the 13 July 2011 USD(I) memo \u201cStorage of Adjudicative Results in the Defense Information System for Security.\u201d"

The DISS (CATS) is the DOD CAF\u2019s designated IT case management system.\n\nAchieving the above goals will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the national security community and the Federal government.  It will decrease the time required to get an individual through the investigation process.  It will strengthen and reinforce reciprocity throughout the federal community by eliminating redundant or incomplete investigations by standardizing adjudicative decisions and by making available to all agencies adjudicative determinations of the Federal government."

The July 11, 2014 \u201cDISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum\u201d revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The JVS Milestone B is scheduled for 2nd Quarter, Fiscal Year 2015. \n\nThe DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities. DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program\u2019s acquisition approach."

DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login\/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user\u2019s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document\u2019s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.\n\nDTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011."

DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.  Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.  In FY2015, DRAS 2 has it's own PE 0605090S separate from the PE referenced in this submission."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  \n\nWithin the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and  undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."

Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting.  These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.\n\n\nThe DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies\u2019 financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of  agencies and field activities across the DoD.  DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.   The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\n\nThe DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  \n\n\nDAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, \u201cReform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise\u201d.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2014\/FY 2015 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: \u201cStrengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements\u201d. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. \n\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.\n\n\nDAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  \n\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n- Common business processes and data standards;\n- Access to real-time financial data transactions;\n- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and\n- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\n\nThe DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICEFW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support."

Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives."

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.\n\nThe Defense Logistics Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within three DLA Elements:\n\nJ3 R&D\n- Advanced Battery Manufacturing (BATTNET): \n- Advanced Castings and Forgings (PRO-Fast):\n- Anti Counterfeiting:\n\nJ6 R&D\n- TBD\n\nDMEA\n- TBD"

Modern battlefield requirements demand subsistence support that adequately provides for the needs of our military personnel in extremely intense and highly mobile combat situations that can be easily adapted to the civilian sector for humanitarian feeding. In FY 2014, DLA Troop Support Subsistence sold $4 billion in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense and other customers. The Rations portion of this business was $702M in FY 2014. The Combat, Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Rations R&D funding request is .002% of sales. The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR). The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage; and better ration variety. CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations. The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for Combat, Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Rations."

The Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program was initiated in 4th quarter 2014. The strategic objective of the DLA Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program is to identify, adapt, and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time from development to sustainment from years to months or weeks for the military uniforms and individual equipment.  The Program focuses on quick-reaction and technologies that will transform the military uniform supply chain from a two-dimensional (2D), manual environment into a three-dimensional (3D), digital environment.  The resulting knowledge based system will develop a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military uniform requirements to the military uniform industrial base."

Cast parts are ~2% of all hardware National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  PRO-ACT develops methods and technologies to improve the supply of cast parts. We take a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA\u2019s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA casting suppliers.  This program includes tasks in developing new and improved metalcasting capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented."

Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings. This program develops methods and technologies to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA\u2019s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts: Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die)."

Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying\/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices."

Partner Contracts were based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Battery Maintenance, Competition & Contracting Requirements, Diminishing Manufacturing & Supply, Lithium Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge\/Sustainment, and Technology Transition\/Insertion. The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&D groups, is informed of general R&D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.  Additional projects were awarded to BATTNET partners from FY12 Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF)."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  \n\nThis SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Combat Rations, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  \n\nThe Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2013, DLA received 130,600 orders for 2.76 million batteries at $177M net value.\n\nThe Combat Rations network is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) and Unitized Group Rations (UGR). The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage, and better ration variety. CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations. The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations.    \n\nThe Castings consortium objective is to develop methods and technologies to improve the supply of cast parts; looking at root causes of supply issues inside DLA and at casting suppliers.  This program includes tasks to develop new and improved metalcasting capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders.  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  \n\nThe Forgings consortium objective is to develop methods and technologies to improve the supply of forged parts; looking at root causes of supply issues inside DLA and at forging suppliers. The program has three thrusts: Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die to eliminate trial and error development of the die. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings. \n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler."

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as \u201cnon-procurable.\u201d This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  \n\nThe Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM\/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD\u2019s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems. \n\nThe Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.

This SFA includes Military Uniform System Technology and the Defense Logistics Information Research (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope.  The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.  \n\nThis Strategic Focus Area has 5 Roadmaps:  Military Uniform System Technology (MUST), Model Based Enterprise, Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability, Proactive Forecasting and Retail Support, and Supplier Operations Interface.  \n\nThe Military Uniform System Technology roadmap will address GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a \u201cknowledge based approach\u201d to collaborate on define and communicate of military uniforms.  DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base.  Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders.  MUST will research enabling technologies and apply them to reengineering technical data requirement management process for the common environment recommended by the GAO.  \n\nThe Model Based Enterprise will develop capabilities operations to systematically accept, validate, store, item design information in 3D models.  There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment.  The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the designs.  The problem with legacy part is that they do not have engineering models so a specific decision has to be made on the economics of recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.  \n\nThe Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.\n\nThe Proactive Forecasting and Retail Support will roadmap will identify ways to look ahead at military operations and budgets to systematically identify parts there demand changes can be expected.  The alternative is reactively waiting for forecasting to recognize trends which could be after the fact and too late to affect logistics support decisions.  \nThe Supplier Operations Interface Roadmap will work with DLA process owners, the DLA supply chains and the industrial base, to identify the relevant data sets and most desirable methods of providing DLA suppliers with NIIN inventory visibility where the supplier is contractually responsible for providing a specified level of support. Allowing suppliers to more effectively anticipate DLA\u2019s requirements will improve both DLA and supplier efficiency."

The PDC is a public\/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)in October 2011.\n The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA\/DR). PDC\u2019s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.\n\nThe PDC Program Office\u2019s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&GS), and DASD(DC&MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA\/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities."

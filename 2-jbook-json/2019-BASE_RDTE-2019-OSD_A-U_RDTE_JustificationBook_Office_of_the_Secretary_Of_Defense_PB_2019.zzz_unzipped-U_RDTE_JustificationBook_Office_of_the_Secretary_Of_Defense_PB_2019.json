Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.\n\nThe Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (Vannevar Bush), formerly known as the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program."

This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department.  SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve the science and engineering (S&E) workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with the academic research community and international partners.\n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative, a department-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation\u2019s only social science basic research programs in support of national security.  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise."

STIx showcased and connected the nation's brightest minds to communicate new ideas and share novel approaches to confronting old challenges facing the defense community.  Its Ted-like lightening talks were streamed online over two days and are posted on the web.\n\nPlanned and published a broad agency announcement for the Defense Enterprise Scientific Initiative (DESI) pilot program with assistance from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in August 2017.  DESI was funded through the FY 2017 plus-up.  The program aims to inspire the collaboration among universities and industries in fundamental research.\n\nExecuted the first competition for the I-Corps @ DoD Commercialization pilot program, and supported 6 teams established in FY 2016.  One team received follow-on private capital to commercialize their research and another received the most improved award from the National Science Foundation's I-Corps teaching team.  The second competition is currently underway and will fund up to 12 teams.\n\nSelected ten laboratory scientists for the 2017 class of Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative (LUCI) Fellows.  The research topics included advanced manufacturing, robotics, data analytics, optics and novel engineering materials.  The awardees included NDSEG and SMART Fellowship recipients.  Organized the first review of the LUCI program in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory in September 2017."

These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation by enabling an increased capacity to address ever-changing future defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through programs and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges.\n\nNDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and hires the students, upon graduation, into DoD's workforce.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,400 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 1,350 have completed their academic pursuit and transitioned into DoD employment.  Approximately 1,100 have completed their service to the Department.  SMART ensures the Department has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission.\n\nThe MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, authorized the establishment of this Pilot Program.\n\nSTEM Education and Outreach fosters conditions for activities to support and cultivate STEM talent with minds for innovation, diversity of thought, and the technical agility to sustain the Department\u2019s competitive edge.  In order to build a necessary workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Initiatives include investing, promoting, and participating in national-level STEM programs and efforts as well as providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the Nation.\n\nThe DoD is constantly looking for innovative scientific and technological solutions to address current and future military requirements.  The MEEP will enhance existing or establish new education programs that support manufacturing engineering."

In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  Approximately 1,100 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 74 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.\n\nOversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.\n\nSince FY 2005, approximately 2,400 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2016, approximately 1,350 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components."

In order to build a necessary workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Investments are made to promote participation in national-level STEM programs and initiatives and provide authentic hands-on experiences for students and teachers across the globe.  Specific initiatives include internships, scholarships, and mentorships through partnerships with industry to include FIRST Robotics, MATCHCOUNTS, and the Center for Excellence in Education\u2019s (CEE) \u201cRickover\u201d and Research Science Institute (RSI) programs.  To supplement the MCPP, the Department has partnered with the Society for Science and the Public (SSP) to provide science resources to military-connected high schools.  In addition, STEM Education and Outreach manages activities, in support of the Department\u2019s STEM Strategic Plan, to assist in attracting, inspiring, and developing exceptional STEM talent across the education continuum.  STEM Education and Outreach develops and maintains systems and standards to support its programs, implementing the Communications Plan and collaborating across the Federal government and public domain through interagency and intra-departmental working groups and partnerships."

The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.\n\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting."

This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned to the Program Executive Officers (PEOs), thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges.  This is especially true with increased performance requirements for improved and new systems. \n\nThe JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks."

Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.

The LL Program supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds ten technology project areas.  \n\nOf these, there are five core-technology areas:\n\u2022 Advanced Devices\n\u2022 Optical Systems and Technology\n\u2022 Information, Computation and Exploitation\n\u2022 Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology\n\u2022 Cyber Security, Science and Engineering\n\nThere are four emerging-technology initiatives:\n\u2022 Advanced Materials and Processes\n\u2022 Quantum System Sciences\n\u2022 Biomedical Sciences and Technology\n\u2022 Autonomous Systems\n\nThere is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. \n\nThese ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence:\n\u2022 The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today\u2019s global S&T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW\/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow\u2019s future.  The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies."

Development of a small laser radar in FY 2018 will allow real-time 3D images on a small unmanned air vehicle. Microwave radars with multiple receivers have many advantages including multiple look angles, stealthy receivers, and higher resolution.

The ability for wavelength agility will become as important in the optical domain as it is for microwave electronic warfare.

However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cybersecurity of all Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure the Department's missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cybersecurity and computer network operations to:  develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new and resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military\u2019s ability to disrupt, fight and survive nation-state actors\u2019 cyber-attacks, measure the state of health in cybersecurity, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, along with the ability to protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.\n\nThis program is unique in that it integrates both the defensive and offensive cyber research from each of the Services to develop interoperable, defense-wide technology options targeted to meet Combatant Command needs and requirements.  More specifically, by increasing cross-laboratory collaboration, this program is able to take Service-specific technologies and expand their applications to the Joint Force."

                                        "val": "The Cyber Applied Research program was initiated in FY 2011 to address specific technical problems that were not being fully addressed by the Services\u2019 and the National Security Agency's existing Cyber science and technology (S&T) investments.  Recently, S&T gaps were enumerated and described in several studies, including the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2016 Commission Enhancing National Cybersecurity, and the 2017 Defense Science Board Research Enterprise Assessment.  The Cyber Applied Research program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  Over the past several years, the program expanded research in cyber capabilities to provide Warfighters and commanders with tools and technologies to enable cyber situational awareness, cyber command-and-control, cyber operations, and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  From FY 2011 to FY 2017, the program explored a number of technical thrusts that included:\n\n\u2022 Foundations of Trust:  Developing known degrees of assurance that devices, networks, and cyber-dependent functions perform as expected, despite attack or error.  \n\n\u2022 Resilient Infrastructure:  Exploring technologies that not only withstand, but react to cyber attacks, and sustain or recover critical functions. \n\n\u2022 Assuring Effective Missions:  Developing technologies that assess and control the cyber situation in mission context while staging, conducting, and monitoring cyber responses.\n\n\u2022 Cyber Modeling, Simulation & Experimentation:  Simulating environments in which the Department operates and enables a more robust assessment and validation of the cyber technology development. \n\n\u2022 Embedded, Mobile & Tactical Environments:  Exploring cyber systems that rely on technologies beyond wired networking and standard computing platforms.\n\nAs adversaries develop more sophisticated technology tactics and become more skilled and better funded, the Cyber S&T Community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  Starting in late FY 2016, the Department reviewed the emerging needs of the joint operational community, new cyber threats, and the evolution DoD technology needs to focus the program on the changing cyber environment and missions.  To bolster this program and address future threats, a new strategic vision was developed to enhance the DoD\u2019s tactical edge in the rapidly evolving cyber domain where many aspects still remain unexplored.  Seedling projects under the new research areas were initiated in late FY 2017.  Judiciously investigating aspects of this research in thrusts areas identified below will provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts: \n\n\u2022 Behavioral Cyber Sciences:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond signals (ones and zeroes) towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral sciences will increase the effectiveness of tools, the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber sciences seeks to uncover details about how humans (to include operators, users, adversaries, and\/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood from a behavioral science standpoint and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcome.  \n\n\u2022 Self-securing weapons, systems, and networks:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to keep pace with the growing complexity of weapon systems and help the DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the recent advances in artificial intelligence research. \n\n\u2022 Foundations of precision cyber operations:  Precision bombing campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired effects of cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.\n\n\u2022 Mathematical Foundations of Cyber Security:  Advancing mathematical foundations of cyber S&T will cut across focus areas and produce new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.\n\nAdvances in these new cyber S&T focus thrust areas will help to promote strong foundations and disruptive innovations that will create surprises, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas will be critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cyber security beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense."

Resilient algorithms and protocols increased the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research was needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resilient architectures.\n\nFunded research under the Tactical Platform Cyber Resiliency project, developed techniques for furnishing resiliency on critical real-time control systems against cyber-attacks.  Through the enhancement of existing fault tolerance on physical systems, known as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), combinations of artificial, manipulated crashes, and delayed input evolved a level of tolerance to enforce resilience.  The successful collaboration with Siemens transitioned the technology to the Naval Capability Program, Resilient Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical Security (RHIMES), which is now supports the NATO Sea Sparrow program.\n\nUnder the Network PUMP-II project, research explored the challenges of optimizing enterprise based data sharing requirements for the tactical war-fighter and intelligence missions.  The project developed a cost effective, high throughput government-off-the-shelf cross domain solutions that provided the war-fighter with improved sensitive data correlation and intelligent data decision capabilities.

The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems was to develop tools and techniques that assured the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons systems and platforms; enabled security in real-time systems; and established security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also sought to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating enterprise commodity mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it was of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices could be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked.\n\nThe Resilient and Assured Unmanned Aerial Systems Operations (RAUSO) project developed technologies to harden unmanned aerial systems (UAS) platforms and provided better cyber awareness to operators through the integration of a number of cyber tools and capabilities.  The approach leveraged a high-assurance hardware platform developed under the Assured Resilient Embedded Systems (ARES) program, to build a cyber security module software stack capable of monitoring sensor inputs and process behavior, while responding with security-relevant actions. The technology has been incorporated into the ARES platform and is being considered for a General Electric (GE) Aviation flight control system, with possible flight tests in FY 2018."

The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against cyber-attacks.  Defending the software- and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  The Department can expect future cyber adversaries to be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that can defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against the adversary.  The DoD needs systems that will autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems could identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, be able to neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems is crucial to ensure that direct control can be reasserted, potentially reversing actions, if necessary."

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts \u2013 providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.\n\nThis effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1 and 5000.02.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nThe Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition Insensitive Munitions (IM) response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow and Fast Cook threats."

This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to technology maturity and demonstrate the technologies to technological maturity utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture."

First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets."

CTTS is expanding its partnerships with other Defense rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users. \nCTTS major area of emphasis during FY18 and FY19 will be projects to Counter-ISIL.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat\/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.\nSpecific CTTS areas of emphasis in FY18 and FY19 include Counter-tunnel, Countering-sUAVs, improving digital operations at the tactical level, increasing lethality of small weapons and ammunition, and addressing threats to commercial aviation.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. \nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products."

FCT supports DoD best practices by incentivizing the use of prototyping and experimentation in advancing technological solutions to warfighter problems and acts as a hedge against threat developments. FCT enhances interoperability, facilitates international collaboration, increases competition, and enables more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record. Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Emerging Capability & Prototyping (DASD(EC&P)), Comparative Technology Office (CTO). FCT projects are sponsored by the Military Services and USSOCOM. Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements and DoD priorities, a thorough market survey, and an emphasis on transitioning technologies into current or future programs of record.\n\nThe FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries. Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. Defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement. The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States. To date, companies from 34 states benefited from FCT projects."

The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment.  The DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched, at a minimum, dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD\u2019s relatively small investment leverages DOE\u2019s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers that develop technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of munitions laboratory technical directors and senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD gaps, needs, and challenges.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  \n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 32 current projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success."

                                                    "val": "The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new Energetic Materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.\n\nBoth Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.\n\nThe Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects and improved lethality.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.\n\nThe desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in part by recommendations of the Long Range Research and Development Program Plan (LRRDPP) and the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining and improving lethality, effects, and safety.  \n\nIn order to clearly establish overmatch, the Department is working to increase the range and speed of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  This thrust includes the development of hypersonic and hyper-velocity weapons.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  DoD may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and the ability to initiate weapons under extreme conditions.\n\nTCG-III is also a forum for the exchange of information on new energetic materials, their performance and sensitivity characteristics, and physical models that can be used to predict the behavior of energetics under adverse and unplanned conditions.  It is a venue in which collaboration opportunities can be identified to facilitate the transition of technology developed in the DOE to the DoD.\n\nThe specific projects in the energetic materials technical focus area for FY 2018 are:\n-  Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.\n-  Insensitive munitions and surety.\n-  Cheetah thermochemical code development and experiments.\n-  Micro- and nano-energetics synthesis and initiation.\n-  Hazards analysis of energetic materials.\n-  Reactive processes in energetic materials.\n-  Development of tools for energetic material performance characterization.\n-  Explosives chemistry and properties, and new energetic materials formulation.\n-  Thermal response of energetic materials."

Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department\u2019s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. \n\nThe miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.\n\nThe specific projects in the initiators, fuzes, and sensors technical focus area are:\n-  Firing Systems Technology, comprising FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.\n-  Safe, Arm, Fuze and Fire Technology, comprising Initiation and Detonation, and Advanced Firing System Components.\n-  Advanced Initiation Systems, comprising diagnostics development, microdetonics, miniature initiation systems, and detonators for enhanced safety.\n-  Thermal Battery Performance Modeling to develop a multi-physics modeling capability for thermal batteries.\n-  Thin Film Thermal Batteries to develop, mature, and transition a method to produce a thin, conformal, low-cost thermal battery.\n-  Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) sensors for proximity fuzing of munitions with very low size, weight, and power requirements.\n-  Enabling Robust, Mode-Agile GPS-Denied Weapon Guidance through High-Efficiency Data Processing."

Significant increases in warhead performance are directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department\u2019s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. \n\nThe goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny\/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength, high performance, and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.\n\nThe specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area for FY 2018 are:\n-  Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.\n-  Dynamic behavior of concrete.\n-  Integrated munitions modeling & experimentation for penetration and MBX target coupling.\n-  Modeling of strategic structures subject to ballistic impact or blast.\n-  Concrete perforation and penetration modeling and experiments.\n-  Explosive\/metal interactions.\n-  Structure, mechanical & shock-loading response, and modeling of materials.\n-  Controlled effects warhead materials."

Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating, predicting, and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and\/or components.  These objectives are achieved by identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.\n\nThe specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:\n-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.\n-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.\n-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.\n-  Complex system health assessment.\n-  Physical\/chemical reactive transport modeling of material\/system aging and reliability."

Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. \n\nThe analysis process addresses the following Joint and Cross-Cutting missions: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assess counter technology options, and provide an operational value assessment; and 3) Development of Analytic Tools to help understand complex and longer term challenges. The Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). \n\nTypically, the ratios of resources applied to Operational and Technical Assessments, Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team, and development of Analytic Tools will be roughly 30\/60\/10 percent.  Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the Combatant Commands."

Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. The emerging nature of the problem sets makes specific identification of all the study projects beyond the budget year unlikely. Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year-to-year.\n \nOperational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2018-2038 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n- KCA across Defense Planning Scenarios and other relevant DOD Vignette to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace. \n- Developed and maintain an all source-like database of military capabilities and a standalone software application, KCA Results Display System, to provide data and analysis on operational issues.\n- Produce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.\n- Consolidate Technology focused roadmaps of US capability development and S&T developmental strategic plans. \n\nTechnical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC\/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD\/DoE) laboratories. Using these research performers, previously sponsored research on relevant topics is leveraged in the new research providing value and experience on new projects. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-  Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.\n-  Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies. \n-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability.\n-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.\nAnalytic Tools include modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A), computer based engineering models, and purposed designed equipment to demonstrate or confirm theoretical performance of technical concepts. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-  Develop analytic tools to inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.\n-  Develop strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.\n-  Integrated MS&A leveraging Service- and Agency\u2013level virtual and constructive resources to provide insight into complex acquisition and operational decisions.\n-  Red Teaming existing and planned US capabilities and weapons systems using emerging threat systems and capabilities in emerging scenarios."

In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that will be a source of battlefield advantage, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation.  \n\nLeveraging innovative technologies from commercial startup companies has the potential to rapidly address warfighter problem sets in areas where commercial innovation outstrips government investment in the same technology areas. Through a unique partnership with other government agencies, we gain access to and vetting of innovative technologies from commercial startup companies where much of the research and development (R&D) funds are provided by the venture capital community.  Small DoD investments in these companies, often in partnership with other U.S. Government agencies, further leveraging the dollars spent, provides short work programs to adapt the commercial technologies for warfighter applications. The deliverables from the work program allow the warfighters to rapidly pilot technology and concepts, with the ability to fail early and cheaply, and provide the avenue to refine warfighter requirements and transition technology from successful pilots to traditional DoD activities for integration into broader R&D efforts or acquisition programs of record."

This effort focuses on maturing and demonstrating the automated processing of  space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Artificial Intelligence-driven Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Fix-Find-Finish-Exploit-Assess (F3EA) into an integrated capability to aid the Combatant Commander and Component forces in defeating threats posed by nuclear-capable, mobile missile - a problem set often plagued by sparse data.  The approach is composed of three innovative building blocks:  1)  Machine learning techniques applied to commercial GEOINT and other commercial data sources for automated country-wide anomaly and change detection - crucial element for enhancing  indications and warnings required for precision strikes; 2)  Machine-Human collaboration architecture to accelerate the F3EA joint forces targeting and decision-making cycle; and 3)  Autonomous weaponeering demonstration - Exercise secure (C2S) cloud for timely precision strikes to hold mobile missile systems at risk.\n\nExpansion of the Datahub Pilot Program.  Following a successful demonstration of Datahub and its leverage of commercial data sources and automation in early 2017, the team was directed to expand Datahub to address applicable issues in the remainder of the DoD 4+1 problem sets.  Some of these problem sets may leverage similar technologies to the pilot program, with data coverage for different parts of the world and algorithms tuned for different targets of interest, while other problem sets may require completely different data, algorithms, and\/or technologies.  Although FY 2017 funding was only 50% of what was expected, the team is executing preliminary efforts to execute the expansion when FY 2018 funds become fully available. \n\nInnovation for other warfighter problem sets:  Through the unique partnership in place for this effort, DoD is exposed to a wide variety of emerging commercial technologies which have potential applicability to a wide spectrum of DoD problem sets.  Enabling the warfighter to execute short duration pilots with these evolving technologies provides a cost effective way to leverage commercial investment for DoD purposes, informing warfighter requirements for follow-on acquisition through traditional DoD channels, and allowing DoD R&D organizations to focus their resources on both the integration of commercial technologies showing promise in these warfighter pilots, and on traditional R&D in technologies not well served by the commercial start-up companies."

                        "val": "To counter the United States\u2019 historic technological advantage, adversaries are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices that have become globally available.  These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, small unmanned air systems, and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems such as advanced sensor systems, advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) components and systems, advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles that can diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.\n\nThe rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and the myriad of new advanced Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats have made operations in the EMS significantly more difficult and complex.  The challenges posed by new kinetic and non-kinetic EMS threats and the dire consequences of technology surprise highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can rapidly address these new threats in more cost-effective ways.\n\nThe Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program was established to address these challenges through efforts designed to significantly accelerate the development and transitioning of new EW and EW-Cyber capabilities.  To do this, the JEAT program explores, assesses, and validates a plethora of new technologies and approaches focusing specifically on technologies and approaches that fall outside the Services\u2019 Research and Development (R&D) programs or are being developed by the Services at rates that cannot not produce required capabilities in the needed timeframes to identify the most fruitful EW and EW-Cyber R&D opportunities for the Department.  To identify potential nearer-term and lower-cost solutions, the JEAT program also explores and assesses approaches that integrate and demonstrate off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways.  The JEAT program\u2019s approaches have provided substantial savings for the Services and the Department in both R&D efforts and in Programs of Record, and thus enable required military capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible in traditional DoD approaches. \n\nJEAT program efforts are focused in four areas in two Project Codes.\n\n\u2022\tIn Project 619, Joint Electronic Advanced Technology, (1) the Experimentation\/Demonstration effort utilizes innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to understand current and future threats and explore potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities, (2) the Advanced Technology Development\/Verification effort explores technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways, and (3) the EW Collaboration and Planning effort ensures appropriate coordination and technological oversight of Department and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&D programs and processes and provides governance insights for senior decision makers.\n\n\u2022\tIn Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation, (4) this effort explores computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies, tools, and approaches to enhance awareness and accelerate planning and decision making in essential EMS war fighting capabilities."

Project 619\u2019s three efforts, Experimentation\/Demonstration (Expt\/Demo), Advanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V), and Electronic Warfare Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P), focus on enabling nearer-term technology transitions to the Services\u2019 Programs of Record (PoR) with reduced risk and cost.  Expt\/Demo efforts focus on exploring, demonstrating, and assessing innovative technologies and approaches to overcome existing and developing threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for the U.S. military.  ATD\/V efforts integrate advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in ways not being explored by the Services to demonstrate nearer-term technological opportunities.  EW C&P efforts within Electronic Warfare and Countermeasures Office (EWCO) of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering assess, ensure coordination, and provide senior leadership insights on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber Research and Development (R&D) as well as coordinating national and international EW and EW-Cyber efforts. \n\nExperimentation\/Demonstration (Expt\/Demo):\n\nExpt\/Demo explores and demonstrates new EW and EW-Cyber technologies and approaches through the use of large-scale, dynamic field experimentation venues.  The current venue, Vigilant Hammer (VH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive event focused on advancing the state of the art for detecting, classifying, geolocating, and engaging of electromagnetic signals of interest.  Modeled after Project 619\u2019s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, VH includes both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new capabilities and approaches to engage emerging Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats.  Follow-on venues will address concerns such as multi-platform\/multi-aperture, collaborative\/coherent EW and multistatic passive\/active sensing architectures.\n\nAdvanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V):\n\nATD\/V explores, matures and assesses emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs.  Project 619\u2019s ongoing ATD\/V effort, the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory, explores, matures and assesses emerging EW and EW-Cyber technologies to enable, for example, multi-aperture collaborative\/coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment through exquisite coordination of sensing and electronic attack capabilities. \n\nEW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P):\n\nEW C&P supports all activities of the Director, EWCO, related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of all EW and EW-Cyber-related efforts across DoD.  EW C&P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, and the Services on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD.  To do this, EW C&P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensor, seeker, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures, and battle management technologies.  EW C&P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)) on PoR, including technology maturity and availability, Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure, and Technical Signals Requirements.  EW C&P also conducts and leads analyses of advanced threats and technological opportunities to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&D research, development and acquisition efforts."

The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes to the field for military utility assessment (MUA) to affordably operationalize technologies that enable warfighters to explore novel concepts and to facilitate informed transition to formal programs of record (PoR) when appropriate.  Based on the results of the assessments, performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are either \u201cleft behind\u201d for additional assessments or operational use, transition to a PoR, or returned to the technical baseline inventory.\n\nThe key tenets of the program are in alignment with the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering USD(R&E) guiding principles to: shape major technology investments within DoD, focus on joint and cross-cutting missions, prove new concepts of operation, inform and or validate requirements, leverage open systems architectures, and identify accelerated paths to acquisition.    \n\nThe JCTD program achieves this by engaging the interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the Department of Defense's (DoD) access to innovation.  It serves as the vehicle for CCMDs to address Joint strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment, which often fall into the seams between the military Services and DoD agencies.  JCTD investments are informed by the CCMDs\u2019 integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessment provided by the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps.\n\nIn FY 2017, the JCTD program successfully completed the MUA and transition of several JCTD prototypes that fielded affordable and sustainable solutions to meet immediate operational needs.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:\n\u2022\tThe JCTD Program has executed 113 JCTDs from FY 2006 to present.  The data shows a transition rate for the program of 81 percent with 52 percent of capabilities transitioning to a PoR, 25 percent to operational fielding, and 4 percent to General Services Administration (GSA) schedule.  The remaining 19 percent were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations while rapidly accelerating game changing technology\/capabilities."

Low Cost Missile Defeat (LCMD) is a ballistic missile defense system designed to counter current and emerging weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threats.  LCMD program execution has been structured using a building block approach; the FY 2015 step was a technology demonstration effort under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Emerging Capability & Prototyping (DASD (EC&P)) to accelerate technology maturation.  The concept of operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary\/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability would augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.  Funding was allocated for participation in the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Low Cost Interceptor Study (LCIS) and risk reduction for key technologies, including the seeker and thrust vane subsystems, modeling and simulation of subsystem design capabilities, and limited prototyping for component flight boards and gimbals.  Results from the LCIS indicated there are more cost effective and viable options for a low cost interceptor.  Accordingly, DoD discontinued the LCMD program and saved the intellectual property and data package for future BMD development efforts.  The LCMD JCTD was closed out in late FY 2017."

(1) CCMD Direct Support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project development, demonstration, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling the CCMDs to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  Executes a select number of classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness (SSA) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance."

AMPEE demonstrated a mission planning system and the ability to conduct cognitive netted distributed electronic warfare on multiple class unmanned aerial systems.  2) Scanning Infrared Sensor for Unmanned Air Vehicle Detection and Tracking (SISUDT), a prototype fixed-site, multi-sensor counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) to detect, track, and identify group one and two UASs near forward operating bases.  One SISUDT prototype was deployed in support of Operation Inherent Resolve for an in-theater validation of infrared UAS detection.  3) Strike Awareness for Gray Zones (STAGE) a risk mitigation effort to address shortfalls in the STAGE JCTD proposal by defining a management structure, technical approach, and transition plan for the effort."

The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare capable of advanced jamming and signal collection techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  Department of Defense (DoD) advances in smart sensors and smart weapons have an urgent need for more resilient networks than tactical data links of today.  In FY 2016, the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) returned with a new focus on developing enabling technologies for Joint assured communications networks.  The goals of this program are: to mitigate degradation across battlespace tiers and domains and to provide agility that will support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and deployed forces.\n \nThe DoD\u2019s current TDLs platforms and capabilities are not sufficiently protected from emerging adversary threats and contain insufficient capacity for future needs.  In order to enable the promise of net-centric operations for the warfighter, the next generation of airborne, surface, and ground tactical networks must provide greater affordability, higher network capacity, greater durability against electronic attack, better network connectivity, and faster response times to the changing demands from airborne, maritime, and ground users.  Many line-of-sight (LOS), beyond LOS, and SATCOM waveforms have been integrated onto platforms for various missions.  These waveforms necessarily exhibit tradeoffs in target performance attributes including capacity, latency, protection, and complexity.  As a result, no single waveform capability will be able to satisfy all emerging mission needs emphasizing the need for interoperability and software defined waveforms.  The challenge is to understand the essential needs of the users, avoid needless redundancy, develop affordable capabilities, and integrate separate capabilities into a cohesive network.  This research will develop transformative technologies to ensure performance in contested A2\/AD environments by focusing on future communications networks that are a \u201cleap ahead\u201d of today\u2019s capabilities."

The primary threat is from advanced jamming, signal collection, and geolocation techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  DoD advances in smart sensors and weapons demand robust tactical waveforms and networks with greater capacity but lower cost than communication links of today.\n\nThe Future Autonomous Battlespace RF with Integrated Communications (FABRIC) (formerly referred to as Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM)) program will develop next generation communications layer architecture for tactical networks for operations in anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threat environments.  This architecture will deliver capacity and affordability to enable future smart sensors and smart weapons.  The network architecture will be flexible enough to support Commander\u2019s Intent in any mission, environment, operating tactical platform, and weapon system under various threat conditions.  FABRIC\u2019s efforts will focus on developing the advanced component technologies, such as Anti-Jam(AJ), Low Probability of Interference (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) waveforms; adaptive processing algorithms; adaptive antenna technologies (transmit\/receive\/nulling); adaptive power control; Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)\/Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) techniques; self-healing mechanisms and cyber hardening; and advanced routing to ensure Quality of Service.  The guiding tenets for creating this new Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) capability encompass enabling new missions, i.e. providing  resilient tactical data links, communications and networking \u201cservice level\u201d capabilities, interoperation, cost (affordable), and improved performance in terms of military value.\n\nBased on the developed thresholds and objectives for the required network architecture, the specific advanced component technologies were prioritized and form the foundation of the FABRIC design.  Through simulation and field experimentation, FABRIC will verify the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and facilitate the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems."

                        "val": "The Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&T) program is the joint, defense-wide component of the DoD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program directed in Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2521, the latter of which represents the Department\u2019s comprehensive advanced manufacturing program focused on enabling the strategic goals of timely, affordable delivery of dominant technologies to the warfighter, and improving the acquisition and sustainment of defense products and systems across their life cycles.  Designing for manufacturability early in the development of defense-essential products and systems can yield dramatic and positive impacts for the Department\u2019s operational and modernization missions. \n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T component of the DoD ManTech program specifically focuses on the development of cross-cutting and potentially game-changing manufacturing technologies, processes and capabilities that are typically beyond the scope or risk of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform.These high-leverage, defense-wide investments are designed to benefit the performance, affordability, and delivery timelines\/deployment cycles of many of the department\u2019s most essential products and systems in ways that are not typically achievable through the efforts of a single service, agency or program office.\n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T program, therefore, is a unique and fundamental DoD ManTech Program component that is needed to optimize a coordinated manufacturing technology development process across the department broadly.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes and capabilities along with S&T development enables the timely, affordable adoption and deployment of emerging technologies needed to maintain U.S. warfighting dominance.  Key DMS&T technical areas for investment include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing, and respective technology focus areas addressed by each of the DoD-led manufacturing innovation institutes (discussed in the next paragraph).  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design\/qualification\/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.\n\nManufacturing innovation institutes established by the DoD and part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program are also funded in this program element. Technical innovation and leadership in U.S. manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of industrial competitiveness to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. Eight DoD Manufacturing USA institutes have been established to serve as regional hubs accelerating technological innovation and associated production processes and educational\/workforce competencies for military and commercial applications via shared public-private sectors.  These Manufacturing USA institutes, supported by resources from multiple U.S. Government agencies, are generating significant industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and are forming new technology transition pathways via regional hubs spurring active collaboration among government, industry, and academia to help meet critical government and warfighter needs. The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President\u2019s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,\u201d published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) \u201dNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan\u201d and 3) \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,\u201d both published in February 2016."

Investments in both cases are built and managed in collaboration with the Department\u2019s research, development and acquisition (RDA) communities (including active, ongoing coordination with the DoD ManTech Program\u2019s Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel) and industry and target the development of defense-essential advanced manufacturing processes and associated workforce capabilities.  The portfolio includes a focus on above-the-shop-floor new manufacturing processes and practices having the potential to improve manufacturing efficiencies at broader, enterprise levels. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to more surgically apply investments to compelling and sometimes urgent manufacturing needs.\n \t\t\t\nData calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements, and then down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through funding opportunity announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including \"above the shop floor\" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP,and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level."

Focal points are productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base to accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs. Future efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, lasers, enhanced acuity microdisplays, and transparent ceramics for opto-mechanical and armor applications.\n\nThe Transparent Ceramic Initiative will address DoD applications for electro-optics, including fibers, films, and bulk solid state components, such as windows. Typical materials include: sapphire, ALON, and spinel. Transparent ceramics offer the potential for improved ballistic strength for battlefield armor and personnel protection. Investments include but are not limited to: high strength spinel scale-up, Nanocomposite Optical Ceramics (NCOC) powder scale-up, infrared windows, and curved transparent ceramics. \n\nProjects:\n\nMini Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and Imagers (FY 2016): Expedite the transition of 10 um (TEC)-less SWIR cameras to the warfighter and develop wafer level processing techniques to improve yield and reduce contaminants in the SWIR focal plane array (FPA)\/ camera assembly. Will establish the industrial base for SWIR technology systems and components. Reduced unit cost allows more individuals to carry imagers; 6x improved cost, reduced from $30K to $5K; 3x reduced size from 3cm3 to 1cm3; 3x reduced weight from 120 g to 40 g. Applications include COSI, INOD, COS3, AWST, Joint Effect Targeting System (JETS), IDNST, PAWS, and MTS-B.\n\nMini Vis - SWIR Cameras and Imagers (FY 2016): Develop a manufacturing capability to produce one camera that can see the entire spectral band of Visible, Near Infrared (NIR), and Short-wave Infrared (SWIR); while being compatible with visible, NIR, and SWIR laser pointers and illuminators. Applications include: COSI, INOD, COS3, Advanced Weapon Sight Technology (AWST), Joint Effect Targeting System (JETS), Integrated Day\/Night Sight Technology (IDNST), PAWS, and Multispectral Targeting System (MTS-B).\n\nManufacturability of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) \u2013 Phase II (FY 2016-2018): Develop the capability to produce a Multi-Function Laser Illuminator and Pointer that delivers the functionality of five different devices (Green, NIR, and Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) Laser Pointers plus NIR and SWIR illuminators) in a single, high-power, lightweight unit, which would give the warfighter commonality with all other weapon systems and be covert. Would provide the SWIR VCSEL a three-fold increase in efficiency and output power to meet critical needs for covert illumination in both High Definition and SXGA formats. Applications include: PUMA, RAVEN, TigerShark, Anubis, Spectre-FINDER, Speckles, TigerMoth, WAAS, PAWS, IPODS, AngelFire, MAV-OBAT, nLoss, LOS-short, CLRF, Joint Effect Targeting System (JETS), IDNST, TLDS, Big Safari, OEF, OIF,  STINGER , and ARGUS, others.\n\nVital Infrared Sensor Technology Acceleration (VISTA) High Temp Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) Detectors (FY 2016-2017): Establish a critical domestic industrial base for MWIR focal plan arrays (FPA) having capabilities in III-V antimony-based Infrared (IR) FPAs to reduce size, weight, power, and cost while increasing yield and operability as an alternative to current technology.  Will achieve wafer production scale-up to 40-50 wafers per month while shortening sensor turn-on and cool down time by 50%, extending cooler lifetimes 150% - 200% as a result of reduced stress during temperature cycling, and substantially reducing the sensor lifecycle maintenance cost. Applications include: Air Force: EODAS Enhancement (F-35), EOTS Enhancement (F-35), LWIRST (F-15), Targeting System Enhancements (MQ-9, F-16), Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR); Army: Next Gen FLIR, Degraded Visual Environment, Rotary Wing Pilotage; Navy: Shipboard Multifunction Sensors (APDIS), Overhead Persistent Surveillance for USMC, UAV, and Navy: BAMS, F-18 (Advanced IRST), EO\/IR Standard Integration System (EISIS), and Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast.\n\nImproved Focal Plane Array (FPA) \u2013 Hyperspectral \u2013 Phase II (FY 2016): Demonstrate utility of III-V based FPAs for Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) Hyperspectral (HIS) applications. Up to $1M\/year\/sensor reduction in system life cycle costs compared to arsenic-doped silicon blocked impurity band (Si:As BIB) detectors. Significant reduction in up-front costs compared to Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT). Improved reliability, maintainability, and availability, along with increased detection range.\n\nOrganic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) Microdisplays - Phase II (FY 2016-2017): Establish manufacturing capability for producing an ultra-high resolution, high brightness, high contrast, full color microdisplay at a low unit cost.  Mature and combine manufacturing processes: Silicon on Insulator (SOI) and Direct Patterning technologies to enable a 5X improvement in yield and 5X longer lifetime of displays, reducing life cycle costs. $221.7M savings for aviation and Enhanced Visual Acuity (EVA) goggles (27,700 displays between 2017-2032) x $8K\/unit savings). Applications include F-35 Heads-up Helmet Mounted Display System, Apache, EVA, F-18, F-15, F-16, affordable color\/monochrome displays with high brightness and high contrast to enable Warfighter to fully use sensors and cuing\/augmented reality hardware.\n\nNanocomposite Optical Ceramics (NCOC)(FY 2017-2018): Advance manufacturing maturity of NCOC to replace sapphire. The large reduction of emissivity at elevated temperatures experienced during flight makes NCOC more favorable for a missile dome by increasing the signal to noise ratio. Effort will focus on scale-up NCOC dome manufacturing processes to meet projected AIM-9X full rate production quantities."

Through productivity and efficiency gains, these manufacturing technologies will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, while reducing the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.  Advanced materials manufacturing technologies undergoing development include materials for ballistic survivability and ballistic protection, survivability and rapid fabrication of structural components.\n\nAdvanced Propulsion Initiative: Advance propulsion has a crucial need to develop fuel efficient sustainable propulsion capabilities. Several technologies will be developed including Risk-based Life Cycle Management for System Sustainment and As-Manufactured and As-Maintained State Awareness. In addition, technologies will be pursued addressing capability gaps associated with adaptive engine design and high performance lightweight materials, organic matrix composites, oxide\/oxide composites, thermal barrier coatings for high temperature structure and light weight alloys. Additional capabilities will focus on unique manufacturing challenges associated with affordable Medium-Small Engine fabrication methods including Expendables.\n\nProjects:\n40MM M433 Warhead Producibility (FY 2016): Achieve improved anti-personnel lethality at the squad level, increasing first shot effectiveness against personnel targets through optimization of production process prior to transition to Full Rate Production, avoiding high cartridge unit costs.  Primary applications include Mk 19 GMG, M203 GL, M320GL, and M32 MSGL. Secondary applications include Cannon and Tank Calibers, and Hand Grenades.  \nCold Spray Repair and Rebuild Phase II Large Structures (FY 2016): Expand the Cold Spray product envelope from 5 feet to a target of 40 feet to enable large tubular component repair. Applications include Seawolf Class Submarine Periscopes and TD-63 Actuators.\n\nDimensions on Day One (FY 2016): Demonstrate a methodology that accurately predicts and accounts for the numerous geometric, tooling and material factors impacting finished composite parts enabling the correct upfront process and tooling design to yield first article parts meeting the \u201cdimensional requirements on day 1\u201d.

Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  Projects selected will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations while reducing cost, acquisition time, and risk of major defense acquisition programs.\n\nIt is paramount for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access computer-aided design (CAD) for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.\n\nEmerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  a large-scale challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between the Government and contractors.\n\nProjects:\nMTConnect Challenge Phase II (FY 2016): Promote academia\u2019s educational development and implementation of production interactive solutions to the broad U.S industrial base with the expansion of MTConnect Challenge that contributes to reduced cycle times and the development of real-time production metrics for adaptable dashboard applications.\n\nSecuring American Manufacturing (SAM) (FY 2016): develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities.

To support these goals, Manufacturing USA institutes, each led by non-profit 501(c) entities, have been established by the Department to serve as national assests with headquarters and regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial applications and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DOE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of these Manufacturing USA institutes  will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President\u2019s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,\u201d published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) \u201dNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan\u201d and 3) \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,\u201d both published in February 2016.\n\nEach of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes addressed in this budget is expected to be self-sustaining, without reliance on federal sustainment funding, by the end of the period defined by the respective cooperative agreement (CA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) between the federal government and the non-profit organization leading each institute consortium of members.  This CA\/TIA period is typically for five years, with the flexibility to extend the agreement up to two years for the benefit of DoD projects, technical achievement, etc., and to fully leverage the minimum 1:1 cost share.  \n\nEach of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes is intended to: \n1) Bring together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state and local governments and organizations to create regionally-based but nationally-impactful public-private partnerships underpinning the formation of sustainable manufacturing innovation ecosystems\n2) Accelerate innovation to bridge the gap between Research and Development (R&D) and deployment of technological innovations in domestic production of goods\n3) Invest in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, accelerating innovation within DoD and across all manufacturing sectors to increase U.S. competitiveness\n4) Provide shared assets to help companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment \n5) Create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills\n6) Focus on maturing the associated manufacturing technologies typically from from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 through 7\n\nThe first and second year of each of these new institutes is devoted to establishing a sustainable business model and operations, with continued refinement throughout the full period of the cooperative agreement, including: expanding the institute\u2019s membership base (as appropriate); establishing and solidifying revenue streams (e.g., funding from new R&D activity, membership fees, training and workforce development, certification and licensing, etc.); establishing provisional Executive Council and Technical Advisory committees to execute the business of each institute; finalizing Intellectual Property plans; developing technology roadmaps to inform investment strategies; opening industrial commons to provide for shared resource facilities available to all institute members; initiating workforce training programs in each technology area; establishing complementary relationships between Manufacturing USA institutes; analyzing the U.S. and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements; and further developing national technology roadmaps."

The motivation is to increase U.S. competitiveness in advanced tissue biofabrication manufacturing by encouraging insertion of disruptive technologies into multiple biotechnology sectors, streamlining integrated testing technologies and ultimately reducing the barrier to entry for new inventors. The goal is to establish a collaboration that will mature tissue-related technology across a range of manufacturing readiness levels (MRL) 4-7, enabling post-delivery assurance of tissue identity, viability, function, and efficacy. This Institute will bring together the diverse and currently fragmented collection of industry practices and institutional knowledge across many disciplines (cell biology, bioengineering, materials science, analytical chemistry, robotics, and quality assurance). Scaling up to commercial level production of tissues will require manufacturing and process automation suitable for living cells, as well as testing and preservation methods appropriate for tissue-based products with limited shelf-life and a narrow window of efficacy. \n\nTechnical focus at a minimum will be comprised of four thrust areas: 1) Cell & Material Selection & Sourcing;  2) Biofabrication Platforms;  3) Process Design and Automation;  4) Tissue Finishing and Testing Technologies\nThis institute was established in late 2016.  Technology Investment Agreement funds are programmed in this budget from FY 2016 through FY 2022."

Notwithstanding this complexity, the Department is careful to maintain orientation with the DoD ManTech program\u2019s statutory goals and objectives and has concluded that those requirements are highly complementary to, and supportive of, the broader national goals of the Manufacturing USA Program as laid out in the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014.  Performance relative to both sets of goals\/objectives is necessarily measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and many of the institutes accomplishments previously addressed represent rich and highly descriptive qualitative and quantitative measure of program performance.  The Department actively reviews or oversees the review of institute metrics at four levels: 1) the overall Manufacturing USA network level (this is done in coordination with the DoD\u2019s Manufacturing USA interagency partners), 2)  at the DoD\/funding agency level (per the statutory requirements of DoD ManTech Program), 3) at the individual institute level (in coordination with each institute), and 4) at the specific technology project level (via DoD technical expert involvement in the institutes). Broadly, the institutes themselves are charged by the DoD, the Administration and Congress with ensuring that key elements of their innovation ecosystems will be matured and made widely available by fostering collaborations between appropriate elements of that ecosystem. The following four categories of metrics have emerged as common focus areas:\n1.\tImpact on U.S. Innovation Ecosystem\n2.\tFinancial Leverage\/Sustainability\n3.\tEducation and Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development \n4.\tTechnical Advancement\nSpecific metrics and the annual cycle for measuring progress against benchmarks are developed for each institute consortium and reflect that institute\u2019s unique technology capability, expertise, and organizational structure. The Department strives to ensure that the assessment process captures and articulates the benefits to national security based upon technological advancements and the industrial base."

With an emphasis on interagency and joint partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span one to three years through efforts that emphasize affordability, typically at a cost of less than $6.000 million.  The ECTD program focuses on rapid prototyping of emerging technologies to accelerate capabilities to the joint warfighter, including electromagnetic spectrum-agile capabilities; multi-domain, autonomous systems; counter-weapons of mass destruction capabilities; and, dismounted soldier systems.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman\u2019s Gap Assessment, USD(R&E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).\n\nIn anticipation of a heightened emphasis by the new USD(R&E) on outpacing threats and seizing technical opportunities, ECTD is structured to mature emerging technologies and highlight their military capabilities through joint demonstrations and ECTD sponsored venues for defense-wide experiments and demonstrations.  These include Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance venue; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  Together, these events enable newly-developed capabilities to be showcased in realistic environments with operational user involvement.  The ECTD program supports red teaming efforts to identify vulnerabilities in emerging technologies early, ensuring follow-on systems are resilient to adversaries.\n\nIn response to changing Department of Defense priorities, two new project lines are being added to the ECTD PE.  The high energy laser (HEL) project will begin development work to integrate a HEL onboard an AC130 aircraft.  This will enhance special operations forces\u2019 ability to provide precision fires.  The red teaming project line will assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies.  This will enable the new Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering to make informed decisions on building new capabilities."

Operational users leverage Thunderstorm to experiment with mature and emerging commercial technologies that may meet mission-critical gaps.  In addition, Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for small businesses and non-traditional technology developers to demonstrate capabilities in operationally relevant scenarios while interacting with operational commands and other government personnel.  Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, post-demonstration assessments, and data evaluations serve to identify new capabilities and new ways to employ existing capabilities.  Thunderstorm annually features approximately 55 technologies resulting in about $3.000 million in cost avoidance.  In FY 2017, Thunderstorm demonstrations and experimentation focused on port security, dense urban and subterranean warfare, and maritime-to-shore access control; and, demonstrated 42 technologies to representatives from 30 Department of Defense and interagency organizations."

The program supports field demonstrations and red-teaming to stress and assess emerging systems in key areas for gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life-cycle.  This project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats.  It informs requirements and helps accelerate acquisition pathways for joint missions.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, academia, and industry to develop a construct that current or future systems can be gamed against in a distributed, operationally-relevant environment employing traditional and non-traditional players.  Deliverables will inform technology acquisition and new concept of operations."

Efforts range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants including warfighters, scientists, engineers, students, and academics.  Deliverables include recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new concepts of operations."

It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Resilience, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training\/readiness, sustains DoD\u2019s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer."

It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Resilience, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high-priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  Technologies developed by SERDP enhance military operations, improve military systems\u2019 effectiveness, enhance military training\/readiness, sustain DoD\u2019s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and by reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer."

JWP supports partnership for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Component programs that equip forces for joint missions. The account underwrites analyses and studies,  limited-scope experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.   JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions. This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and affordable joint solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.   JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD, the Joint Staff and joint command counterparts, the AT&L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on joint warfighting environments in the future.   \n\nTypical projects funded with JWP include independent analysis and translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources support  analytic expertise on joint issues.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also supportthe development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts. \nThe  JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  In many cases, JWP funds initiatives for process improvements serving all Components, but aligned with no single Service or Agency.  These early assessments and studies of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  JWP often represents the first effort to define integrated and innovative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities through cross-cutting analysis and studies in partnership with  the OSD staffs serving AT&L, Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.  It evolves analytic development of Joint Military Requirements addressing evolving threats \/ missions On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS."

JWP supports partnership for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Component programs that equip forces for joint missions. The account underwrites analyses and studies,  limited-scope experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.   JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions. This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and affordable joint solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.   JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD, the Joint Staff and joint command counterparts, the AT&L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on joint warfighting environments in the future.   \n\nTypical projects funded with JWP include independent analysis and translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources support  analytic expertise on joint issues.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also supportthe development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts. \nThe  JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  In many cases, JWP funds initiatives for process improvements serving all Components, but aligned with no single Service or Agency.  These early assessments and studies of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  JWP often represents the first effort to define integrated and innovative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities through cross-cutting analysis and studies in partnership with  the OSD staffs serving AT&L, Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.  It evolves analytic development of Joint Military Requirements addressing evolving threats \/ missions On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS."

This program was originally established in the 1990s in response to the NDAA (FY99, Section 378 of Public Law 105-261) and granted additional authorities via Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13111) and other supporting publications (e.g., 10 U.S. Code \u00a72249d). Organizationally, this PE reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&T)). \n\nThis PE provides policy oversight for distributed learning (e.g., online courses, smartphone-based learning, web browser\u2013based simulations) and supports associated innovation, modernization, and coordination across DoD, Coalition partners (e.g., NATO), and other federal agencies. This work largely focuses on distributed learning interoperability (i.e., ensuring interagency technical and organizational systems function together) and helping agencies acquire new distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiency. Ultimately, this PE\u2019s work promotes personnel readiness, helping the right people to receive the right training and education, at the right time\u2014at the right cost. \n\nThis PE\u2019s work falls into three interrelated categories: (1) Modernization, (2) Documentation, and (3) Coordination. The \u201cmodernization\u201d work involves Advanced Technology Development (6.3) in technical areas such as e-learning, mobile learning, learner modeling and analytics, and software interoperability. These efforts inform the PE\u2019s \u201cdocumentation\u201d work, including the authoring and upkeep of technical guidance and policy documents, such as DoD Instruction 1322.26 (\u201cDistributed Learning\u201d) and software interoperability specifications. Finally, the documentation work drives \u201ccoordination\u201d efforts, which consist of implementation support and interagency\/interorganizational coordination. \n\nThis PE\u2019s modernization investments are driven by requirements collected from the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, a working group of military personnel and DoD\/federal civilians (at the O-6 and GS-15 level) who represent their agencies\u2019 distributed learning equities and are key stakeholders in shaping the direction of these agencies. These requirements are aligned to DoD\/federal strategic direction, such as the Army Learning Concept for Training and Education for 2020\u20132040 (TP 525-8-2), Navy\u2019s Sailor 2025, and Air Force Strategic Master Plan, and they are considered against emerging industry trends and technologies. \n\nThis PE benefits DoD in three ways. (1) Interoperability: It strengthens interagency, interorganizational, and multinational interoperability by governing distributed learning interoperability policy, maintaining current technical reference guidelines, and fostering their implementation across communities of practice. (2) Efficiencies: It saves government resources by fostering unity of effort across DoD, other federal agencies, and Coalition Partners for distributed learning, eliminating duplications and identifying opportunities for interagency collaboration. (3) Learning Effectiveness: It helps improve training and education effectiveness by helping DoD, federal, and Coalition stakeholders acquire and implement emerging distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiently. In sum, this work supports the components\u2019 training and education missions, helping them increase personnel readiness while driving down training and education portfolio costs."

This program is supporting its development by investigating the specifications and web-based digital services needed to make training and education technologies interoperable. In FY17, an early \u201cTotal Learning Architecture\u201d prototype was tested with 75 Special Operators at Ft. Bragg. In FY18, this project will enter its second phase of development and will include additional empirical testing. \n\nLearning Data \u2013 In FY17, this program led a revision to DoD Instruction 1322.26, after extensive coordination with the Services and Joint Staff. The revised Instruction recommends the use of the Experience Application Programming Interface (xAPI), a technical specification that enables data exchange across training and education technologies. In FY18, this program will continue to refine the xAPI specification for semantic interoperability and will coordinate with stakeholders to deliver the implementation guidance, conformance testing tools, learning analytics, and data visualization capabilities they need to make most use of it. In FY18, this work is also expected to inform updates to DoD Instruction 1322.26\u2019s fungible technical references.\n\nCompetencies and Credentialing \u2013 In FY17, this program investigated competency and credentialing management technologies, and it prototyped a web-based competency framework tool as part of the Total Learning Architecture demonstration. In FY18, this PE will continue its coordination efforts across defense and federal agencies for competency-based learning, and it will continue working with professional specifications and standards bodies in development of associated interoperability specifications to aid permeability across organizational boundaries. \n\nPersonal Assistant for Learning \u2013 Adaptive learning tools promise to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of training and education, and these tools are critical parts of DoD\u2019s modern \u201clearning ecosystem\u201d vision. This program examines the science and technology needed to design such capabilities, using open-architecture and open-source methods. In FY17, this PE successfully tested several frameworks, including a smartphone-based system with Defense Language students and a table-based e-book capability with Special Operators. In FY18, this program plans to work with other agencies to transition some of these capabilities into operational use, coordinate with professional specifications and standards bodies to author relevant technical guidelines, and to continue development of these emerging capabilities. \n\nInteragency and Interorganizational Coordination \u2013 In FY17, this program provided distributed learning modernization support to more than 40 defense agencies (e.g., The Army Distributed Learning Program, Naval Education and Training Command, Air Education and Training Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command, Joint Knowledge Online, Defense Acquisition University), more than 15 international partners (e.g., NATO, The Technical Cooperation Program, Partnership for Peace Consortium), and other federal agencies (e.g., National Park Service, Customs and Border Protection). In FY18, this program will continue to coordinate with these stakeholders and with relevant working groups, such as the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government."

Typical metrics include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged by other defense and federal agencies, the increase in the number of interoperable training and education digital systems, the impact of these efforts on defense\/federal strategic planning, and downstream reductions in training and education portfolio costs. \n\nDOCUMENTATION: For the policy and documentation efforts, metrics include at-least annual update of published guidance, ensuring the documentation adheres to current technical\/industry standards. The policy and documentation utility is also judged based upon its use, including both number of vendors adopting the policy and number of defense\/federal acquisition efforts adhering to the guidance.\n\nCOORDINATION: For the interagency and interorganizational coordination efforts, performance is first measured based upon the number of agencies, international organizations, and professional groups directly supported. Success is measured based upon the number of requirements consolidated across defense and federal stakeholders, an increase in partnering between agencies for distributed learning resource sharing, and, ultimately, in improved return on investment for distributed learning efforts."

Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  Reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has increased (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the January 2017 Defense Science Board Report, \u201cDefense Research Enterprise Assessment,\u201d software, autonomy, and cyber are today\u2019s core challenges.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to ensure a competitive advantage.  \n\nThe Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD\u2019s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management. \n\nThe SEI Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I), Autonomy, Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems."

                        "val": "The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts experiments designed to develop capabilities in anticipation of emerging adversary threats, while addressing immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  QRSP efforts support the Department\u2019s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by leveraging commercial technologies and acting as an incubator for potentially game-changing capabilities.  This Program Element also supports the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) strategy to address future threats in a more competitive environment with resurgence of near-peer competitors and adversaries who have studied and worked to counter U.S. technological capabilities.  QRSP provides an agile mechanism to affordably counter emerging technological threats, inform the requirements process, and help maintain DoD\u2019s technical superiority, while fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  Funding in this Program Element enables the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) to anticipate and respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman\u2019s Gap Assessment, USD(R&E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).    \n\nThe QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell support.  Focus areas within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access\/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; target identification and tracking; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; technical risk assessments through wargaming; and, autonomous systems.\n\nThe QRF objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies and accelerate these capabilities to the warfighter.  The QRF program initiates prototyping projects during the execution year to mature technologies critically needed for the CCMDs.  QRF focus areas include anti-access and area denial, broad electronic warfare, and autonomous learning systems for processing and analyzing intelligence streams.  \n \nThe RRF objectives are to develop proof-of-concept prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies, and expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative and affordable concepts and technologies that meet time-sensitive operational needs as identified by CCMDs, military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as advanced algorithms and software intelligence, to enable conceptual prototyping with agile technology insertion.  The program also leverages existing capabilities in our traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      \n\nThe JRAC focus is on responding, in timeframes acceptable to the CCMDs, to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that are submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  To meet these objectives, JRAC leverages contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nThe SMA Cell's objective is to support CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  SMA products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership."

QRF focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs.  QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.\n\nIn FY 2018 and FY 2019, QRF will continue to identify and fund prototypes and technology demonstrations that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Investments respond to Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities, including the following interest areas: counter anti-access and area denial; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; novel human identification technologies; human-machine collaborative decision making; and, counter-electronic warfare technologies. \n\nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022  Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech: This project successfully developed a speech triage capability to determine if and when there is speech in a captured radio frequency signal.  Once speech has been detected, the prototype can identify speakers, languages, and keywords in real time across multiple channels.  In 2017, this project transitioned to the Naval Air Systems Command Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office (PMA-290) for deployment and follow-on integration on Navy signals intelligence platforms.   \n\u2022  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization: This project developed new Link 16 improvements for increased anti-jam communication performance.  The project also designed a real-time processor that fits into existing radio circuit card slots to increase adoption of the new technology.  Details of this project are classified.  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization transitioned to the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) radio program for integration into the Link 16 baseline system.\n\u2022  CyberPhantom: This project developed fully customizable cyber tools for open network exploitation.  The solution leveraged best practices of the cyber workforce and expanded cyber space capabilities with a unique blend of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software integrated with new customized tools.  Details are classified.  In January of 2017, CyberPhantom transitioned to a classified operation user."

It achieves this by anticipating adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responding to new threats and opportunities.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and increase \u2018speed to market\u2019 by providing cost effective capabilities faster than typical acquisition cycles.\n\nIn prior years, RRF supported the development of alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing innovative technologies.   \n\nIn FY 2018 and FY 2019, RRF will continue to provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and developing near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  RRF projects support goals from the new Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering).  The RRF\u2019s current focus areas include: open source data analysis; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization; prototypes for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; additive manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; maritime technologies; and, novel applications of repurposed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) technologies.  Typical RRF projects address these focus areas through a conceptual prototype within 6 to 18 months and for less than $1.000 million.  \n\nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022  Advanced File Carver: This project developed a completely new tool that allows the rapid extraction and recovery of files from large data stores such as hard drives.  The Advanced File Carver significantly increased the functionality available to users over comparable GOTS\/COTS competitors while simultaneously increasing performance speed ten-fold.  Additionally, this tool provides capabilities previously unavailable, including the reconstruction of partially overwritten files, and the recovery of digital images whose headers were deleted.  As a GOTS solution, the Department of Defense (DoD) has made this technology available across the Department and to over 15 federal agencies.\n\u2022  Ingres Tactical WiFi: The airborne Ingres system uses active WiFi signals and advanced processing algorithms to provide an accurate geolocation of target devices in dense, electromagnetically congested, urban environments.  Ingres can identify WiFi transmitters, such as a target's phone or laptop, with better than ten meter accuracy from standoff distances.  Ingres is transitioning to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command to perform evaluations in operationally relevant environments.   \n\u2022  Aluminum Start System: This project developed an electric plasma start system for aluminum combustors to replace the standard hydrogen-oxygen pilot-flame ignition system.  Aluminum combustors are an effective alternative to fossil fuel engines that can use sea water instead of air for oxidizer; however, current systems require pressurized hydrogen and oxygen to initiate combustion.  The prototype microwave-powered steam-plasma torch eliminates hydrogen-oxygen start systems and their associated risk.  This effort transitioned to the U.S. Navy for follow-on development and integration into the aluminum combustion power system for large displacement unmanned underwater vehicles.\n\u2022  Bloom: Responding to an emerging operational need, Project Bloom developed a moored buoy capable of long duration surface measurement operations.  The system provides a platform for radio frequency (RF), magnetic, optical, radiological, and chemical sensing on a standardized and easy to deploy buoy.  The Bloom buoy includes an internal winch capable of submerging it for \"sleep\" periods and to avoid approaching craft.  The operational prototype was deployed to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility and transitioned."

Due to increased speed from design to prototype, reduced cost, and reduced waste, additive manufacturing provides a unique supporting capability for maintaining a U.S. competitive advantage.  This focus area will leverage swiftly-developing commercial innovation and emerging capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia to develop conceptual prototypes focused on warfighter needs.  Projects include spare part replacement, jet engine repair, custom hardware enclosures, and three-dimensional (3-D) models.  Projects have the potential to significantly improve supply chain efficiencies by storing parts as software and manufacturing on demand, and by using rapid prototyping to reduce the time and cost of design.  Projects can also reduce amount of labor required to produce functioning prototypes.  Projects will also investigate security of additive manufacturing technologies and digital schematics.

The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&S, enhances the DoD M&S Enterprise by (1) enabling joint and cross-cutting cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&S.\n\nThe Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department\u2019s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of 23 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD\u2019s systems engineering research problems.\n\nEngineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for achieving more affordable and mission-resilient warfighting systems designed within a shorter time frame by conducting research and development and new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, modeling capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.  These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that enables advanced knowledge management and multi-community collaboration, including data retention and lessons learned."

Its products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks that will integrate physics-based models and engineering tools across acquisition disciplines to vastly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, iteratively optimize designs and improve architectures to reduce or eliminate sensitivity to adversary tactics and capability improvements, and adapt those designs over time. The goal is to provide new pathways to acquisition and achieve a vitally-needed transformation in the contribution of Defense systems engineering to design resilience and effectiveness across the systems lifecycle. These engineering improvements are essential to accelerate capability to the warfighter and address a geopolitical environment marked by rapidly changing threats, tactics, missions and technologies, and fiscal constraints. The pace of change renders current point-design approaches unsustainable in both cost and time.\n\nERS research and development focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.   These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports transparency, inclusion and data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration.  ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased\/easier utilization of High Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability. ERS provides the capability to fully explore and identify key performance parameters and inform the requirements process.  With ERS, DoD is buying down the risk of future systems by using high-fidelity modeling and advanced analyses of design options, as well as linking candidate platforms to traditional modeling and simulation toolkits and employing DoD\u2019s high-performance computing assets."

This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&E\/S&T Program performs the following activities:\n\u2022 Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&E) requirements.\n\u2022 Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&E community.\n\u2022 Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&E.\nAdditionally, the T&E\/S&T Program examines emerging T&E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion. The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other Government agencies, and industry to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  The program outreaches and engages academia to address test technology challenges in DoD testing, advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other minority serving institutions.  This program provides travel funds for T&E\/S&T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  The T&E\/S&T Program aligns with the S&T Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&T investments.  The T&E\/S&T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities."

Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  \n  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\n  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\n  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

HSST continued progress toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine\u2019s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to \u201cfly the mission\u201d and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope. Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number (M4.5-7.5) aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that the component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The HAPCAT project continued to develop and demonstrate air delivery system (ADS) technologies to provide uniform flow with variable pressure and temperature through a nozzle up to Mach 7.5 conditions.  The project activities included the design and initial fabrication of the ADS and conceptual design of a full scale facility. \n  Efforts continued on the morphing ceramic nozzle for hypersonic ground test facilities project which seeks to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  Following validation testing conducted at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), efforts were made to begin the refurbishment of the nozzle for implementation into the HAPCAT facility.  \n  Construction of the Large Energy National Shock (LENS) Tunnel II extension was completed and evaluated to verify extended run times. Such testing will enable the full development of complex flow features affecting vehicle performance, the determination of control surface responsiveness and effectiveness, and the evaluation of the performance of aerodynamic features. The improvements will help fill a critical test capability gap and support future hypersonic vehicle programs. Initial facility performance assessments of the extended tunnel demonstrated a three-fold increase in test run time.  The facility was successfully used by multiple customers who required the expanded capabilities in order to meet their test objectives.\n  The HSST project continued development of a mid-pressure arc heater prototype.  The prototype replaced an existing Huels arc heater with a segmented heater, creating a test envelope approximately three times larger than the current envelope for aerothermal testing.  Validations runs were successfully completed confirming extended test run times of up to 30 minutes and a higher thermal load representative of that experienced by a hypersonic vehicle TPS. These efforts advanced progress toward the goal of improved T&E of maneuvering reentry and boost\/glide vehicles. In a related effort, the arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development progressed toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.   The effort investigated two different spin-coil designs, one of which was validated for use in the mid-pressure arc heater facility.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  \n  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance. Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle. Experimental results acquired through the boundary layer transition effort will be used to validate state of the art prediction tools and measurements of boundary layer transition mechanisms.\n  Facility flow field characterizations were conducted at the Purdue quiet tunnel and the LENS facilities at CUBRC, enabling more effective comparisons between all the facilities and informing test customers of intrinsic flow features in each facility. The characterizations will also provide insight to boundary layer transition studies in these facilities. The project also conducted testing of a boost-glide vehicle, resulting in critical findings to support future flight tests of the vehicle.   \n  HSST completed development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed\/direction, oxygen\/water content) along a hypersonic vehicle\u2019s flight path.  This technology is a significant advancement over current methods, which employ balloons carrying sensors to sample the atmosphere.  The LIDAR will improve the accuracy of characterizing high altitude atmospheric conditions. This atmospheric data is needed to assess the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development. Testing and demonstration of LIDAR atmospheric sensing was completed and the portable system was transitioned to support test programs at coastal flight test ranges to demonstrate system performance in a maritime environment. Development of an airborne version of the LIDAR continued with the design and testing of hardware components for the in-flight demonstration of the system on a crewed aircraft in preparation for implementation on an uncrewed vehicle. \n  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  The final design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft. \n  The fabrication, and installation of a telemetry capability integrated with a High Altitude, Long Endurance Uncrewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) for a technical demonstration continued in preparation for support of flight testing.\n  Measurements of thermal emissions from the surface of typical boost-glide vehicles in an impulse test facility were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different surface compositions and treatments and filter frequencies for thermal imaging. The completion of this project resulted in valuable insights gained for a boost-glide vehicle design; these insights will be useful for future testing in high-enthalpy (high-energy) facilities.   \n  Advances were achieved in the development of M&S tools. Verification and improvement of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes continued, making use of the unique data sets obtained from HSST scramjet engine tests and boundary layer experiments.   A technical report was generated that summarizes the methodology for conducting boundary layer stability computations in support of acquisition programs, including shortfalls in current capabilities and recommended improvements for the toolsets available. This report was released to the hypersonic community and serves as a benchmark document for use in hypersonic programs.\n  The HSST transient thermal analysis software effort transitioned to users in the hypersonic community to support ground testing and flight testing.  \n  A force measurement system technology development completed for use in short-duration, high-enthalpy test facilities. Such technology will permit testing that elucidates real gas effects on hypersonic vehicles."

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including the potential for a large increase in available bandwidth, but the C-Band spectrum comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band and the band is heavily shared for alternate uses.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size, weight and power) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.\n  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  The DoD strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.\n  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

The networked data recorder addresses CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  The data transmission scheme is designed to minimize the amount and type of data transmitted over the telemetry network, reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed during a test event. This technology enables more efficient use of the RF spectrum by reducing the amount of data transmitted by only transmitting data parameters when changes occur.  \n  A non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne applications was demonstrated showing 10 gigabit Ethernet data speeds required to support CTEIP data transmission requirements. Once ruggedized, this technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard test data transmitter. SET matured technology to enable more efficient handling of multiple priority test data and communications between the network router and telemetry transceiver.  Development continued on a multi-band transceiver operating in the L\/S\/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms.  This technology determines the performance of the telemetry link and selects the optimal modulation scheme based on current link conditions, accounting for issues such as multipath.  Technology enabling the compression of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) data was further matured. \n  The SET project developed technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of large footprint, long range missiles and hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna suitable for mounting on a Global Hawk platform was developed and its antenna gain performance characterized in a high fidelity laboratory environment.  A modular digital beam-forming solution to control a phased array antenna and track multiple targets simultaneously was matured.  These technologies will significantly reduce the system complexity for an airborne phased array antenna, providing savings in terms of size, weight, and power consumption.    \n  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a software-based technology solution to accurately characterize RF spectrum utilization on DoD test ranges. This technology will develop the interfaces to existing range RF spectrum scheduling and resource management tools and also implement a standard set of spectrum usage metrics to quantify RF spectrum usage based on times of day and test programs. This tool will transition initially to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB to support RF spectrum management activities, aid in the identification of future spectrum requirements, and quantify the impact of inadequate access to spectrum, in terms of program cost and schedule."

Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. \n  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.\n  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.\n  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.\n  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.  \n  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system\u2019s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders."

A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects. The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats."

The technologies are required when testing sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide the accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking, and situational awareness) as the data passes among the Services and coalition participants.  \n  The technologies within C4T will remove undesired distributed testing biases while improving test agility and the tester\u2019s ability to effectively conduct rapid analysis of \u201cBig Data\u201d and automated test reporting.  C4T advances test automation features (test planning, test execution, Big Data collection, analysis, and visualization) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using modeling and simulation (M&S) along with hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL)laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and command and control systems accessing and providing information."

These technologies will provide an acoustic propagation model, both narrow and broad band, of sufficient fidelity to test torpedo performance in various maritime tactical environments.  The model includes a real-time simulation\/emulation system for testing torpedo sonar systems in multiple bathometry, biological and threat environments.

They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology developments within the UAST portfolio have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess an autonomous system\u2019s ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.\n  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating, system-of-autonomous-systems that will work in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems."

UAST collaborated with the Autonomy Community of Interest (COI) Test and Evaluation, Verification and Validation Working Group to ensure that UAST is investing in technologies relevant to the future of autonomous systems.\n  The UAST project explored technologies required for T&E of emerging UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces. The UAST project emphasized autonomy test technologies that can be integrated for use in a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) environment within the MRTFB.  UAST continued investments in robustness testing technology to detect and predict vulnerabilities and failures within UAS software.  UAST continued developments to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies will also prevent the test vehicle from violating flight envelopes, range boundaries, and warning areas. UAST initiated an effort to develop a software tool that will enable testers to monitor the internal autonomous processing states of a system under test without interfering with its operations or requiring modification to the system\u2019s software or hardware.

It contains the two projects described below:\n\nP455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes S&T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.\n\nP456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM), co-sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment (ASD(EIE)), develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power\/energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, (2) increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (3) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services and will be used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)."

As Defense-Wide funding, it incentivizes S&T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovations to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects."

This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)."

Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.\n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. \n\nThe program\u2019s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD \u201cUser Defined Operational Picture\u201d (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and\/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. \n\nThe CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program elements (BA-3 \/ PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 \/ PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 \/ PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 \/ PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) \"CWMD Sustainment\" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).\n\nThis project funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.\n\nThis appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts."

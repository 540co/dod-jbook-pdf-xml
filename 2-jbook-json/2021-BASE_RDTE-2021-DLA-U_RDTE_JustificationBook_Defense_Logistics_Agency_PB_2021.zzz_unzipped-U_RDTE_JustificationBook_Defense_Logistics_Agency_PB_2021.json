                        "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program funds the advanced technology development needed to achieve a responsive, efficient domestic industrial base that meets the warfighters' needs in an affordable and timely manner.  The ManTech program works with DLA\u2019s diverse supply chains to improve manufacturing capability throughout a product's life cycle.  It provides the crucial link between invention and application by maturing, scaling up, and validating advanced manufacturing technology in \u201creal world\u201d environments.  ManTech developments provide a path to low-risk technology implementation for many small businesses and defense unique suppliers as well as depots and shipyards that are critical to DLA.  By anticipating and addressing production and sustainment problems before they occur, readiness levels increase and sustainment costs are lower.  \n\nDLA ManTech is aligned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (IIBM); 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply (MVSS); and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information (ITLI).  \n\n\u2022 The IIBM SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products.  This SFA has supply chain focused execution portfolios for food (Subsistence Network), Castings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology), Forgings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology), Batteries (Battery Network) and Additive Manufacturing.\n\n\u2022 MVSS includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements without relying on foreign sources for microcircuits.  This strategic focus area mitigates supply issues caused by the lack of a reliable domestic manufacturing capability to produce products or raw materials needed to build and maintain weapon systems.  The major focus of the program is maintaining a reliable, trusted, domestic source for \u201cnon-procurable\u201d linear and digital microcircuits.  Microcircuit emulation allows the Services to save significant costs by using form, fit and functionally equivalent spare parts rather than redesigning the next-higher-assembly.\n\n\u2022 The ITLI SFA includes efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA, the Military Services, DLA industry partners and DLA customers.  It includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) programs.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected up and down the supply chain and across all DLA Customers and suppliers.  A major focus is to transform DoD engineering data from two-dimensional paper-based products to three-dimensional computer based models, and to develop processes to move from \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF files) to technical data files that can interface directly with industries\u2019 engineering systems. The benefits include shorter product introduction cycles, lower set up-costs for parts production and more economical small batch production.\n\nDLA\u2019s focus for this budget cycle highlights advanced capabilities in digital and technical data modernization, management and analytics to fulfill the DLA role in the DOD Digital Engineering Strategy and improve sharing of data with the industrial base and supported organizations. Investment explores technologies to lower the Agency\u2019s material acquisition and operations costs and improve weapons systems support.  This effort spans across both DLA R&D Program Elements and multiple Strategic Focus Areas, impacting across the DOD Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel and DLA Enterprise logistics processes."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable customer wait times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This SFA includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings\/Forging programs and Additive Manufacturing programs. \n\nThe Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is the successor to the Combat Rations Network R&D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain.  The program's expanded areas of interest include: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security.  SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies.  Desired outcomes include: reduced cost, increased efficiencies, improved processes, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.\n\nThe Casting program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic casting industrial base supporting the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The casting program works with industry, universities, and the Casting Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s foundry industry.  The program aligns projects with strategic issues and identified focus areas within the DLA and DoD. Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the casting industry.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks that focus on developing new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented, most often in conjunction with the casting industry associations.  These advancements improve the metal casting supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DoD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forging program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic forging industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Working with industry, universities, and the Forging Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s forging industry.  The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas identified within the DLA and DoD.  Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the forging industry.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Number (NSN) Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the forging industry associations.  These advancements improve the forging supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DoD weapon systems.\n\nThe Battery Network (BATTNET) program objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy.  BATTNET conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for specific groups of batteries.  BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of Service approved batteries.  Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) program objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA is pursing all AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.  The AM effort pursues alternate means of supply for products that are otherwise non-procurable or susceptible to procurement issues due to an unresponsive manufacturing vendor base.  The AM effort includes the identification of AM candidates among the population of products that are needed but hard to obtain, costly or have long manufacturing lead times.  The AM effort requires management of 3D digital technical and manufacturing data. In addition, the AM effort includes the development of the processes that will tie the designers, engineers, maintainers, logisticians, procurement managers and the vendor base into a seamless AM procurement stream. Potential benefits include products that can address an unfulfilled Warfighter readiness need by reducing production lead times, production costs, storage costs, transportation costs and in some cases fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. DLA R&D will leverage these efforts with Industry, Academia and ongoing Military Service-level agreements (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Department of Energy."

The program will continue addressing additional requirements for manufacturing and material improvements in the vacuum electron tube supply base.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) program plans to fund technically proficient efforts that accelerate the rapid qualification and certification methodologies for AM items, identify the best AM applications for castings and forging preforms, achieve precise repeatability of part fabrication using an AM technical data package at simultaneous geographic points of need and prove the delivery of AM parts to warfighters deployed at expeditionary sea, land or air bases. Using market research, requests for information\/proposals, BAA, DLA R&D will identify the best courses of action to negotiate technical, testing and intellectual property data for AM fabrication to keep these items competitive. The DLA R&D efforts include the proof of concept of using digital thread methodologies to effectively manage manufacturing data and maintain a consistent AM product from design through qualification and acceptance. Collaboration will continue with the Military Service Engineering Support Activities (via Service-level agreements with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force) and the Department of Energy by providing funding for AM work identified under the respective agreements. The partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) will allow further options with the Big Area AM (BAAM) family of parts. DLA will leverage Military Services and Industry collaboration to develop digital verification and validation (including measures of effectiveness and key performance parameters) of AM technical data and first article testing for polymers and metals, and critical and non-critical items. These efforts seek to increase the number of AM parts qualified for procurement and achieve savings from the associated lead-time, storage costs, transportation costs, in some cases reduction of fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options."

This SFA includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST), the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR), and the Emergent Manufacturing Technology (EMT) portfolios within its scope. \n\nThe Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) program\u2019s focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations for DoD to establish a \u201cknowledge-based approach\u201d to define, communicate, and collaborate on military unique combat uniforms and individual equipment (CUIE) requirements.  DLA has the responsibility to manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders.  The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly shorten the time needed to transition Combat Uniforms and Individual Equipment from development to operational use from years to months.  The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military CUIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based manual environment, into a knowledge-based automated environment.  The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end-to-end supply chain.\n\nThe Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program researches core technology to improve the quality, security, and interoperability of logistics data acquisition and management to enable and streamline DLA operations.  DLA enables transformation of business practices and methodologies as the data for weapons systems evolve from traditional formats and delivery methods (such as two-dimensional images and PDF formats) to newer, more innovative methods (such as three-dimensional solid models, object-oriented databases, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 3C standards).  This transformational shift for DLA is driven by the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) approach, the way industry is delivering design and development data for weapon systems to the Military Services and the way the Military Services in turn manage and provide the data to DLA. DLA Logistics Operations, DLA Acquisition, DLA Tech\/Quality, and DLA\u2019s Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) are key stakeholders in the DLIR initiatives to modernize the representation and delivery of weapons systems data.  \n\nThe EMT program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems."

Efforts will continue in FY2020 to advance Digital Manufacturing by developing a comprehensive approach to take advantage of integrated, computer-based systems of simulation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, analytics and various collaboration tools to create and manufacture products to support the warfighter.  Additionally, any emergent Strategic Materials requirements will be addressed through the EMT program. EMT baseline was reduced by approximately $0.353 million resulting from overall MANTECH $3.020 million in directed reductions. Impact of the baseline reduction will result in limited availability of funds for emergent technology requirements in execution years."

DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military services need to operate \u2013 including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Log R&D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. \n\nThe DLA Log R&D program is organized into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs):\n\u2022 Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (EAMD): R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  \n\u2022 Improving Logistics Processes (ILP): R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n\u2022 Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements (ELR): R&D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  This SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes.\n\nDLA\u2019s focus for this budget cycle highlights advanced capabilities in digital and technical data modernization, management and analytics to fulfill the DLA role in the DOD Digital Engineering Strategy and improve sharing of data with the industrial base and supported organizations. Investment explores technologies to lower the Agency\u2019s material acquisition and operations costs and improve weapons systems support. This effort spans across both DLA R&D Program Elements and multiple Strategic Focus Areas, impacting across the DOD Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel and DLA Enterprise logistics processes."

It is critical to National Security for the Department to maintain technological superiority through microelectronics solutions even when industry is unable or unwilling to provide them.  DMEA provides an in-house capability to quickly develop and deliver timely, cost-effective, technically appropriate solutions to sustain weapon systems, to modernize their capabilities, increase their lethality, address new threats, and meet operational demands.  DMEA augments its in-house capability through extensive industry and government partnerships that enable streamlined access to a variety of microelectronics technologies and engineering services to enhance responsiveness, and that develop sources for Trusted microelectronics.\n\nDMEA\u2019s capabilities are critical in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks.  The Department has very little influence over the microelectronics industry; the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market.  Assured access to Legacy, State of the Practice (SOTP) and State of the Art (SOTA) technologies is therefore a major and growing challenge.  Threats to defense microelectronics include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments, consolidation and off-shoring of manufacturing, rapid obsolescence and diminishing technology availability coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. In addition, as the Department maintains its weapon systems longer than originally planned, extended use increases demand for sustainment and modernization, which further intensifies the need for DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities.  \n\nThe Technology Development program (P001) provides the Department with DMEA engineering expertise and laboratories to address the myriad microelectronics issues and to meet military requirements across the entire spectrum of technology research and development, acquisition, and long-term support. DMEA applies its specialized capabilities to resolve microelectronics issues for hundreds of distinct Department programs across the acquisition lifecycle every year.  In addition, DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.\n\nThe Trusted Foundry program (P003) provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs.  The Trusted Foundry program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components."

These funds also support DMEA\u2019s ability to partner with industry, other government agencies, and academia to enable streamlined access to a variety of microelectronics technologies and engineering services. \n\nThese funds enable DMEA to provide increasingly rare government microelectronics design, fabrication, and test expertise to DoD programs. DMEA\u2019s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions\u2014along with its unique technical perspective\u2014allows it to develop, manage and deliver novel, decisive, quick turn microelectronics solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, and cyber and combat missions.\n\nThese funds allow DMEA to maintain and enhance critical, Trusted microelectronics design, aggregation, fabrication, post-processing, assembly and analysis capabilities to ensure that the Department is provided with solutions that enable or maintain the warfighter\u2019s technological superiority over potential adversaries. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. In addition, funding provides for the research, development and support necessary to ensure availability of microelectronics technologies for weapon systems, particularly as the technologies advance and industry is increasingly unable or unwilling to provide them. \n\nDMEA looks to industry to see if it can provide the required solutions. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary solutions using its in-house capabilities. A critical element required to enable continued success is DMEA\u2019s protection of the industry partners\u2019 valuable Intellectual Property (IP) and processes. DMEA is a small, agile government-owned and operated organization, providing the structure and confidence necessary to assure them that commercial IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations. \n\nDMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. Programs that DMEA has recently provided critical support to include Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, C-5, V-22, F-15, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, OSD Joint Fuze Technology Program, among many others. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Operations, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities."

Under DoDI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical\/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid altered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities available to be Trusted sources.  The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities.  This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies. Commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment.  This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies, and is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, along with most other key defense technologies, depend heavily on high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement often translates into significant force multipliers and capability advantages.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors. \n\nThe Trusted Foundry program provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs.  The program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components.  The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements.  DMEA will foster all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry, as well as the extension and implementation of key process technologies for trust at DMEA.  It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues.  Most importantly, access to Trusted Microelectronics is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems.  The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place. \n\nWithin the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.  This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous. \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."

DAI has replaced several different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision-making and financial reporting.  DAI currently provides the capability to produce timely, auditable reports as noted in three consecutive annual unmodified Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) engagements.\n\nThe DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies\u2019 financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies, field activities and non-Service organizations across the DoD.  DAI supports a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision-making.  The DAI business solution, once fully implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\nThe DAI implementation approach deploys a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.6 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative sources).\n\nDAI supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) Strategic Goal 3, \u201cReform the Department\u2019s Business Practices for Greater Performance and Affordability as well as Strategic Objectives (SO) 3.1 \u201cImprove and Strengthen business operations through a move to DoD-Enterprise or shared services; reduce administrative and regulatory burden\u201d as well as SO 3.3 Undergo an audit, and improve the quality of budgetary and financial information that is most valuable in managing the DoD.\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)\/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements.  Common business functions within budget execution include the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report (B2R); Procure to Pay (P2P) with enhancements facilitating SFIS\/SLOA and DoD procurement data standards and direct Treasury disbursing;  Acquire to Retire (A2R) (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (H2R) (Time and Labor reporting and absence management only); Order to Cash (O2C); Proposal to Reward (P2R) (Grants financial management and accounting only; and a phased implementation of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GCR) capabilities supporting audit readiness.  Future Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA). \n\nDAI is currently implemented at 23 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (OUSD(C)).  DAI supports over 62,000 personnel including, 45,600 users.  The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual SSAE 18 assertion packages.  In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the system received an unmodified SAE 18 report with no comments. \n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n\u2022 Labor efficiencies (entering data once) and shared across all business processes (modules), workflows and lifecycle in a modern system;\n\u2022 Reduction in contractor support;\n\u2022 Financial visibility (Access to real-time financial data transactions);\n\u2022 Enabling agility and resilience in execution (No silos \u2013 anyone\/anywhere can backfill and work continues);\n\u2022 Retiring legacy systems;\n\u2022 Shared common business processes and employment of Federal\/DoD Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS, SLOA, Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Procurement Request Data Standard (PRDS)); and\n  United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\u2022 Reducing reliance on custom Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows by leveraging application upgrades \n\u2022 Enhanced Internal controls to ensure accurate data, regulatory compliance and ensuring segregation of duties \n\u2022 Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements; and\n\u2022 Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities.\n\nThe DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition\/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security\/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support. \n\nDLA provides the Milestone Decision Authority (DLA Acquisition), and DLA Information Operations provides the Program Executive Officer, program manager, and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) data centers provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  The DAI PMO serves as systems integrator. Contracted subject matter experts configure COTS to provide compliant business processes."

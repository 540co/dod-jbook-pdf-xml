Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools\/Test Beds for evolving space superiority and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance space, missile defense and high altitude systems. The Future War Center (FWC) will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) delivering the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis, operational planning, and exercise\/ experimentation support.  The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Reconfigurable Tactical Operations Simulator (RTOS) delivering operator in the loop capability for air and missile defense simulation in distributed exercises and experiments.  Worked closely with the document integrators (DI) at United States Army Force Management Support Agency (USAFMSA) to document the 100th and 49th GMD Brigade and Battalion TOEs to ensure the accuracy of the documentation of the associated Force Design Updates. The DI to review the TOEs that were developed and captured the personnel and equipment changes as directed by the approved FDU's.  This FDU confirmed the requirement for a non-standardized motor maintenance section, created additional operations officers within the GMD Brigade, and created a GMD master gunner\/operations NCO to provide oversight of GMD qualification\/certification within the Brigade S3.  Equipment shortfalls and gaps that were identified were validated as new requirements.  An ambulance was added to medical section to provide an organic medevac capability and the maintenance section received a much needed capability to self-recover their own vehicles and transport them to maintenance facilities over 350 miles away.  Proper documentation of the TOE will allow this homeland defense unit to maintain their supremacy over the threat forces they keep at bay.  By closely working with USAFMSA during the development of the TOEs, this ensured that the TOEs documented the results of the FDU accurately.    Proper documentation of the FDUs ensures the 100th MD BDE and 49th MD BN will execute their mission of preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction, reduce hazards to friendly forces, and civilian populations. Secured the approval of both FDU Jr's for the 100th and 49th Missile Defense Brigade and Battalion at HQDA. With the lapse in HQDA organizational integrators (OI), these FDU Jr's were in hold status until a replacement OI was assigned.  This caused a potential risk that the force structure changes would not be approved and have to be applied outside the original FY.  Within weeks of the new OI being assigned, I briefed the OI on the FDU Jrs, the reason for the FDU Jr's and capability gaps the FDUs were correcting, both personnel and equipment shortfalls.  This interaction with the OI allowed him to present these two FDU Jr's in an expeditious manner to the Army Staff at the 1-Star level.  The FDU Jr's were approved by HQDA, and in time to have the TOE and MTOEs created that met the original time lines required to affect these changes in FY 17, thus saving pending force structure reductions from occurring.  The changes to force structure and equipment capability gaps were resolved. Proper documentation of the FDUs ensures the 100th MD BDE and 49th MD BN will execute their mission of preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction, reduce hazards to friendly forces, and civilian populations."

The TAA provides the basis for the Army\u2019s POM development and establishment of the POM Force.  Resourcing and Approval, the determination must be made as to the level of acceptable risk to be taken for each capability. These capability demands are based on Army leadership directives, written guidance, risk analysis, the Army force generation approach and input from the Combatant Commander\u2019s Daily Operational Requirements (CCDOR). TAA builds a POM Force with which the PEGs can develop their portion of the Army\u2019s budget. The POM Force will also determine the OF enabler support force structure and define the Generating Force (GF) necessary to support and sustain the OF capabilities directed in strategic guidance. The determination\nof the composition of the Army force structure, or shape, is an iterative, risk-benefit, trade-off analysis process. Capability Demand Analysis is made up of two separate events: force guidance and quantitative analysis.\n\nParticpate in the Army's FDU process The FDU Includes capabilities development, capabilities determination, requirements approval, and implementation decisions.  Develops organizational design solutions to overcome identified capability shortfalls that cannot be accommodated by doctrine, training, leadership and education, facility, or policy solutions. As part of the solution development, TRADOC CoEs force modernization proponents and non-TRADOC force management proponents consider courses of action across DOTMLPF-P with the intent of deriving materiel, personnel and organizational solutions as a last resort. Once an organizatio nal solution becomes the recommendation, the force modernization proponent begins the integration process across the DOTMLPF-P domains.\n\nTake the lessons learned from the FY17 efforts to continue to evaluate new technologies in realistic operating environments.  This will be accomplished by supporting ongoing efforts that provide the most realistic operating environment available to perform technology gap and cost reduction analysis of space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  Realistic operating environments will be available to determine the ability of the specific technologies to fill capability gaps in terms of utility to the warfighter.  Support of technology demonstrations, Analysis and Demonstration Tools\/Test Beds for evolving space superiority, high altitude and operationally responsive space concepts will address emerging needs and continue to be expanded to ensure that advanced technology development can adequately enhance missile defense capabilities. The Future War Center (FWC) will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) delivering the required high fidelity synthetic operating environment to provide the capability to perform system and cost benefit analysis, operational planning, and exercise\/ experimentation support.  The FWC will continue to provide program management for maintenance, sustainment, and development for Reconfigurable Tactical Operations Simulator (RTOS) delivering operator in the loop capability for air and missile defense simulation in distributed exercises and experiments.\""

Army AMD sensors, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Command and Control (C2), Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks will be assessed against current and postulated threat systems and techniques.  Potential solutions developed by the Army, other Services, and Defense agencies (for example Missile Defense Agency) to close identified gaps will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated CEMA environments.  Assessment events will be conducted approximately every two years. Analysis of results and implementation of potential solutions will occur between events using system-specific funding.  The proposed solutions will then be assessed at the next event after implementation. \n\nIncluded in this line are funds to plan and execute periodic CEMA activities with Army AMD systems, to include other Service and other Agency AMD systems as appropriate.  Upon completion of CEMA demonstration analyses, create concepts for mitigating Army AMD sensor, C2, and RF data link vulnerabilities.  Efforts in this program will also develop tools for use by Army AMD systems to improve overall system performance in contested environments, to include effects-based CEMA Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to assess Army AMD CEMA concepts in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) environment.  Collaboration is required with United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Joint Electromagnetic Preparedness for Advanced Combat (JEPAC) to evaluate, modify, and field existing Army AMD EP Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a Joint environment.  Additionally, there will be continual interface with intelligence communities to maintain cognizance of emerging CEMA threats and incorporate these threats in future CEMA demonstrations.  An output from these activities will be development of a time-phased roadmap that identifies the investments needed to improve the CEMA capabilities of Army AMD sensors, C2, and RF data and voice networks.\n\nFunds in this line will also be used to transition the Army Low-Cost Portable Surveillance (ALPS) sensor from Science and Technology (S&T) into an emerging Program of Record (PoR). Initially, prototype systems will be provided to meet a Combatant Command identified need and to conduct an operational assessment. This program will also develop and integrate ALPS into the Army Integrated Air & Missile Defense (AIAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) to improve the CEMA posture of the Army's AMD architecture. The objectives of this effort are to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent PoR integration risk."

Army AMD sensors, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Command and Control (C2), Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks will be assessed against current and postulated threat systems and techniques.  Potential solutions developed by the Army, other Services, and Defense agencies (for example Missile Defense Agency) to close identified gaps will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated CEMA environments.  Assessment events will be conducted approximately every two years. Analysis of results and implementation of potential solutions will occur between events using system-specific funding.  The proposed solutions will then be assessed at the next event after implementation. \n\nIncluded in this line are funds to plan and execute periodic CEMA activities with Army AMD systems, to include other Service and other Agency AMD systems as appropriate.  Upon completion of CEMA demonstration analyses, create concepts for mitigating Army AMD sensor, C2, and RF data link vulnerabilities.  Efforts in this program will also develop tools for use by Army AMD systems to improve overall system performance in contested environments, to include effects-based CEMA Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to assess Army AMD CEMA concepts in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) environment.  Collaboration is required with United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Joint Electromagnetic Preparedness for Advanced Combat (JEPAC) to evaluate, modify, and field existing Army AMD EP Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a Joint environment.  Additionally, there will be continual interface with intelligence communities to maintain cognizance of emerging CEMA threats and incorporate these threats in future CEMA demonstrations.  An output from these activities will be development of a time-phased roadmap that identifies the investments needed to improve the CEMA capabilities of Army AMD sensors, C2, and RF data and voice networks.\n\nFunds in this line will also be used to transition the Army Low-Cost Portable Surveillance (ALPS) sensor from Science and Technology (S&T) into an emerging Program of Record (PoR). Initially, prototype systems will be provided to meet a Combatant Command identified need and to conduct an operational assessment. This program will also develop and integrate ALPS into the Army Integrated Air & Missile Defense (AIAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) to improve the CEMA posture of the Army's AMD architecture. The objectives of this effort are to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent PoR integration risk."

These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.\n\nProject EK7 Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for a Deep-Range employed Networked Obstacle.  The obstacle will be delivered via fixed wing aircraft and deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.  Area Denial Capability Development provides controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to establish early Situational Awareness of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect, and engage the enemy in order to shape the battlespace at deep operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements."

The obstacle will be delivered via fixed wing aircraft and will deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.   Area Denial Capability Development provides controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to establish early Situational Awareness of an area without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement, and to actively detect, and engage the enemy in order to shape the battlespace at deep operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system, modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements."

The results of the Analysis of Alternatives and evaluation of representative prototypes will support a 3QFY18 Milestone A Decision.  The Army will award contracts\/agreements to conduct an analysis of current Bomb Unit technology that will inform future development requirements during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase.  The Army will award two Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contracts\/ agreements to develop competing prototypes of the selected materiel solution.  Technologies that support the selected system level concepts will be matured during Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction, and a Capability Development Document (CDD) will be developed.  At the end of Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction, and after a successful Milestone B Decision, the Army will competitively award an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract to complete development of the system, complete system integration, develop manufacturing processes, and conduct testing before entering the Production and Deployment phase."

The NBCRVSS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Hazards. Starting in FY16, a Chemical Surface Detector will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuverability of the Stryker NBCRV and increase reliability. Starting in FY17, a Chemical Mass Spectrometer will be developed to replace the Chemical Biological Mass Spectrometer Block II to increase reliability, sensitivity, and the number of chemicals detected. Also in FY17 an update to the Joint Service Lightweight Standoff Chemical Agent Detector (JSLSCAD) will be developed to increase range and probability of detection by reducing its field of view.

                        "val": "The Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions. These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats. To achieve this, Weapons and Munitions Engineering Development Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.\n\nProject 656:  The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank. It has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay and airburst. AMP is the material solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition. In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles. The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015. FY 2016 supported multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase 1 of 2 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). \n\nProject 694:  Joint Light Tactical Family of Vehicles (FoV): Develop and qualify 30x113mm ammunition for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) which will serve as the Infantry Brigade Combat Team Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (RV).  This is an Army directed requirement to enhance the operational effectiveness of the JLTV-RV by increasing precision and lethality capability to defeat personnel and material targets using a 30x113mm weapon system.  Qualify the linked M788 and M789 ammunition and develop airburst capable munitions for use with the Light Weight 30mm Link Fed Chain Gun.\nThe HEAB cartridge will be developed through a competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program. As part of the pre-EMD activities, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Testing with contractors will occur to evaluate potential designs. For EMD, two Full and Open competitive contracts will be awarded. After Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E) the government will down-select to a single contractor for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and two production year options.\n\nProject EB8:  The One Way Luminescence (OWL) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix allowing enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL program's objective is to develop and field a full day\/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability. 7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges. FY 2018 funding supports finalizing 7.62mm concept development. FY 2018 funding also supports maturing the 5.56mm OWL technology, procuring bullet components, tracer material and testing evaluation in order to attain a Technology Level Readiness (TRL) of 6 in FY 2020; and support of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract development necessary for a FY 2021 Milestone B (MS B).\n\nProject EB9:  The Tunable Pyrotechnic Aircraft Countermeasure Flares program supports the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM). These advanced decoys are necessary to address emerging threats and capabilities deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging JUONS from theatre.\n\nProject EC2:  The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158 and the companion trace is XM1159. The overall objective of the ADVAP program is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) a 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge linked 4:1 with a trace cartridge, XM1159, followed by a 5.56mm cartridge variant that will provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun ranges. The 7.62mm XM1158 and XM1159 cartridge will be optimized for use in the M240 Machine Gun.\n\nProject EC3:  The Ammunition Logistics Prototyping program supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  FY2018 dollars will support the completion of system component integration and verification testing and operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system, the completion of prototype development and verification testing of a next generation temperature\/humidity sensor, and the maturation of the design and fabrication of prototype plastic polymer rectangular containers for developmental 5.56mm ammunition.\n\nProject EL7:  The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. FY 2018 dollars support Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction in preparation for a 7.62mm TRL 6 demonstration and preparation for Milestone B (MS-B). Leverage lessons learned from Marine Corp .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort. Purchase test articles and perform engineering tests to qualify the .50 Caliber Marine Corps design\/ammunition for Army use.\n\nProject EL8:  The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) program is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The goal of the LSCA Program is to reduce the Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight. The LSCA Program will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges. The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. FY 2018 funding will support the development of the preliminary lightweight cartridge design to include a Systems Requirement Review, Preliminary Design Review, and manufacturing of Pre-Validation Test Samples.\n\nProject EU1:  The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) project will evaluate, develop, mature, and demonstrate new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The ELCM project will prototype and accelerate the maturation of enhanced lethality technologies, such as Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT), for 155mm cannon artillery munition.  The ELCM project will accelerate the development and maturation of LFT for subsequent integration on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition, 22 December 2016.  ELCM addresses requirements for increased lethality above the current U.S. Army go-to-war 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles, the M795 Insensitive Munition.  FY 2018 funding will support prototyping of enhanced lethality technologies applicable to 155mm cannon artillery munitions.\n\nProject EU2:  The Improved Multi-Option Fuze (iMOFA\/iMOFM) project will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new improved multi-option fuze technologies, components, and subsystems based on Government-owned Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities with built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD-sponsored techbase efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program. This project will support technology maturation and risk reduction, and will evaluate and analyze producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests.  Up to four potential NGPS with built-in DEF technology prototype solutions for improved multi-option fuzing systems from Government and\/or Industry will be prototyped and evaluated.  This project will enable fact-based analysis of new Government-owned height of burst\/proximity fuzing alternatives that are resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats, quantify their effectiveness, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing\/new artillery\/mortar fuzes and munitions.\n\nProject FA5: The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions project is a continuation of FY14-16 efforts initiated under 644120A-ED5.  The objective of this advanced component development and prototyping effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk. Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions are an integral part of US military strategy and continue to enable combat overmatch and dominance across the Land Component battlespace. Unhindered access to trusted Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information under conditions where existing space based PNT (i.e. P(Y)-Code Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied has created the need to develop, prototype, and evaluate new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both PGMs and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense. As such, both precision weapon and munition PoRs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force\u2019s Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army\u2019s Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments across multiple Lethality portfolios.  FY 2018 funding will support requirements for MGUE Increment 2 and Pseudolite related technology maturity for Assured PNT Milestone decisions, analysis and evaluation of various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk, including specific focus on Pseudolite related weapons and munitions integration risk mitigation and Emplaced Weapon Use-Case needed for Precision Fires, and development, prototyping, and evaluation of new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) for PGK, M777A2, and M119A3 when operating in a complex heterogeneous system-of-systems environment, and continue prototyping\/evaluation in support of a subsequent M-Code\/Pseudolite capable setter. \n\nProject FG1: The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) project will analyze, identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate 155mm Cannon Artillery munition area effects capability.  C-DAEM are envisioned as a suite of 155mm artillery munitions, to provide U.S. ground forces with a capability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize, and\/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  Initial objective values for C-DAEM would meet Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) effects capabilities against personnel and light vehicles and exceed DPICM effects capabilities against armor.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed to best inform necessary area effect lethality requirements.  The project addresses requirements from the U.S. Army adopted U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) [AROC adopted 20 October 2016, JROC approved 11 May 2016].  The approved C-DAEM ICD as an Army requirement is located in the Capabilities and Army Requirements Documents number 0438.  The Joint Staffing Designator is Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) Interest.  FY 2018 funding will support the completion of the C-DAEM AoA to inform C-DAEM required capabilities and the Milestone A review with MDA.\n\nProject XT5: Lightweight 30mm x 113mm (LW30) Airburst ammunition is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement. The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the warfighter\u2019s probability in defeating anti-personnel and anti-materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability allows a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel & soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability while troops are in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. FY 2018 supports Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction effort."

It has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015.  FY 2016 supported multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase 1 of 2 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD)."

Qualify the linked M788 and M789 ammunition and develop airburst capable munitions for use with the Light Weight 30mm Link Fed Chain Gun.\n\nHigh Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm LV HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to effectively engage targets at increased ranges using the 40mm M203\/M320 Grenade Launchers. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge.  The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability."

The OWL program's objective is to develop and field a full day\/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm OWL cartridges.  FY 2018 funding supports finalizing 7.62mm concept development.  FY 2018 funding also supports maturing the 5.56mm OWL technology, procuring bullet components, tracer material and testing evaluation in order to attain a Technology Level Readiness (TRL) of 6 in FY 2020; and support of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract development necessary for a FY 2021 Milestone B (MS B)."

These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments.  Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms.  These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging JUONS from theatre.

The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions.  The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ.  This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges.  The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  FY 2018 dollars support Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction in preparation for a 7.62mm TRL 6 demonstration and preparation for Milestone B (MS-B).  Leverage lessons learned from Marine Corp .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort.

This project will support technology maturation and risk reduction, and will evaluate and analyze producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests.  Up to four potential NGPS with built-in DEF technology prototype solutions for improved multi-option fuzing systems from Government and\/or Industry will be prototyped and evaluated.  This project will enable fact-based analysis of new Government-owned height of burst\/proximity fuzing alternatives that are resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats, quantify their effectiveness, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing\/new artillery\/mortar fuzes and munitions."

The objective of this advanced component development and prototyping effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapons and munitions systems to prove component and subsystem maturity in a system-of-systems environment and to reduce subsequent Program of Record (PoR) integration risk. Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions are an integral part of US military strategy and continue to enable combat overmatch and dominance across the Land Component battlespace. Unhindered access to trusted Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information under conditions where existing space based PNT (i.e. P(Y)-Code Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied has created the need to develop, prototype, and evaluate new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both PGMs and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense. As such, both precision weapon and munition PoRs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force\u2019s Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army\u2019s Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments across multiple Lethality portfolios."

Initial objective values for C-DAEM would meet Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) effects capabilities against personnel and light vehicles and exceed DPICM effects capabilities against armor.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed to best inform necessary area effect lethality requirements.  The program addresses requirements from the U.S. Army adopted U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) [AROC adopted 20 October 2016, JROC approved 11 May 2016].  The approved C-DAEM ICD as an Army requirement is located in the Capabilities and Army Requirements Documents number 0438.

Airburst capability allows a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation.  The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel & soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability while troops are in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects.

It will inform Army combat vehicle modernization decisions by informing Army leadership on cost, schedule, technical feasibility, and performance trade-offs.  This will impact decisions on modification and modernization of existing platforms as well as decisions to develop new vehicles or critical subsystems.  It will provide feedback and technological options for the requirements development to streamline the requirements and acquisition process.  This funding will mitigate the risk of technology over reach, and enable the transition of technology from Government S&T investments and other potential technology development sources.\n\nThe funding in FY 2018 will support continued advanced concept development, trade studies, technology maturation\/testing, technical\/operational\/affordability analyses, and prototyping and demonstration of combat vehicles to assess future concepts and designs that integrate emerging Science and Technology advancements.\n\t\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology) and PE 0604115 (Technology Maturation Initiatives)."

The purpose of this funding is to integrate the next generation of technology enabled capabilities developed in the S&T portfolio to demonstrate new capabilities to meet emerging military needs, provide hardware for Soldier operational evaluation \/ feedback, to determine integration potential across the current Army portfolio of ground vehicles and to develop platform level prototypes\n  \nPrototyping allows for aggressive innovation (provides a bridge from Science and Technology (S&T) investment to vehicle integration and operational use), ensures Warfighter requirements are met, mitigates capability gaps, reduces risks (reduces acquisition programmatic technical risks, stabilizes requirements through user evaluation and helps Army senior leaders make informed decisions), enables affordability (minimizes changes during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) and Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) acquisition phases), and has the potential to accelerates acquisition.  \n\nThis Investment enables technology development and offers the potential to accelerate acquisition by reducing risk and possible time during the acquisition cycle.  It will inform Army combat vehicle modernization decisions by informing Army leadership on cost, schedule, technical feasibility, and performance trade-offs.  This will impact decisions on modification and modernization of existing platforms as well as decisions to develop new vehicles or critical subsystems.  It will provide feedback and technological options for the requirements development to streamline the requirements and acquisition process.  This funding will mitigate the risk of technology over reach, and enable the transition of technology from Government S&T investments and other potential technology development sources.\n\nThe funding in FY 2018 will support continued advanced concept development, trade studies, technology maturation \/ testing, technical \/ operational \/ affordability analyses, and prototyping and demonstration of combat vehicles to assess future concepts and designs that integrate emerging Science and Technology advancements.\n\t\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology) and PE 0604115 (Technology Maturation Initiatives)."

The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Memorandum, Under Secretary of the Army, 30 Jan 2014, subject:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF). \n\nThe REF is the Army\u2019s Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with the ability to acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), and non-standard equipment solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for globally employed forces.  It inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select-prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.   The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions to inform materiel development for the future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.\n\nThe REF bridges the gap between the Army\u2019s traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier Readiness, effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF 10-Liner process provides the ability to react quickly to an ever-changing enemy who changes in days and months, not years in a complex world.  The REF coordinates with the COCOMs\/ASCCs in theater to fully understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  Although the REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, it focuses on Brigade level and below to equip solutions to identified capability gaps.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the Soldier\u2019s needs serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).  This establishes a formal acquisition reporting chain that leverages existing reporting venues to ensure appropriate ASA (ALT) visibility, oversight, and direction.  \n\nThe REF capabilities cross all Warfighter Functions:\n1.\tMission Command\n2.\tMovement and Maneuver\n3.\tIntelligence \n4.\tFires\n5.\tSustainment\n6.\tProtection \n\nThe REF FY18 RDT&E request is $3.162 million (Base) and $3.000 million (OCO) and is for system integration, testing, and evaluation to support project requirements.   \n\nThe RDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, and innovative solutions.  RDT&E funds are necessary in the majority of all REF projects.  Most importantly, REF requires RDT&E funds to conduct safety certification (testing) for non-standard equipment before it is equipped to the Soldier.  This critical requirement exists to ensure that REF-provided equipment is safe for Soldiers to use and that any risks are identified and documented.  The REF also requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different COTS\/GOTS and NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.  RDT&E funds maybe used to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) systems or advanced technologies in conjunction with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs).  Frequently, these technologies only need small amounts of funding to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed U.S. Army Forces problems.  \n\nThe REF requires RDT&E funds to modify, test, and evaluate existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, however may be suitable to solve another problem.  REF will also fund deliberate projects in support of technology-solution-scouting to meet anticipated Army needs and to mitigate operational gaps.  These efforts measure and identify current technologies, and provide information to better inform Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and other communities of interest, with the intent of enlightening future Army requirements.  Example efforts that may require RDTE include the following projects:  Tactical Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and communications systems; tactical and small Combat Out Post\/Forward Operating Base (COP\/FOB) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Force Protection systems; Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS); Electronic Warfare (EW); Non-Tactical Vehicles (NTV); Persistent Duration UAS, and Subterranean (SubT) Operations."

All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment are provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved acquisition program or terminated through an approved Army process.  Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation and future capability development.  REF capabilities routinely serve as a bridge to specific ONS, JUONS, and JEONS gaps to meet urgent operational requirements."

TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the analysis and tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations."

TENCAP (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the analysis and tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near-real-time support to contingency operations.  \n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $27.733 million provides for: (1) engineering and collaborative development on multiple validated National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced developments to ensure continuous Army interoperability with those IC assets and architectures; (2) advanced development of more effective intelligence collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); (3) Advanced Miniaturized Data Acquisition System (AMDAS) 'Next' sensor development; and (4) advanced development of signal capabilities for Air Vigilance (AV) Army Program of Record."

The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these National capabilities into enduring Army programs."

The family utilizes advancements in thermal and low light level sensors to produce Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), and Sniper (S) weapon sights operable in-line with a day optic or in stand-alone mode. This project integrates a smaller pixel focal plane array in multiple large format sizes to improve sensitivity, clarity, and range, while simultaneously reducing the size, weight and power consumption of both the Crew-Served and Sniper variants.  The FWS-I variant is a weapon mounted long-wave infrared sensor that enables Soldiers to fire quickly and accurately from any carry position and with significantly reduced exposure to enemy fire by providing a wireless zeroed weapon aim point in the Soldier's goggle. Leveraging the success of the Individual variant development, the FWS-CS variant operates as the primary sight; it includes a wireless Helmet Mount Display (HMD) and provides the Soldier, with input from a laser rangefinder device, a more accurate aim point that adjusts automatically for range, ammunition characteristics, and vertical angle. The FWS-S variant mounts in-line with the Sniper\u2019s direct view optic providing a thermal imagery capability to the host weapon at the weapon\u2019s maximum effective range, plus 20% overmatch.  FWS-S provides Snipers a large format display with increased pixel density that enables accurate long range engagements while maintaining day sight, extending the lethality and providing exceptional observation."

This Program Element includes Projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques. It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities. The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential. EQT demonstration\/validation is systemic, i.e. applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site\/installation problem (e.g. unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination). This PE will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention). All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e. \"technology is heading for user to implement\")."

The NDCEE is used to: demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process. The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation. This Project is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations & Environment. In May 2008, the Project name was redesignated from the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters. This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, \"Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management.\"\n\nThe United States (U.S.) Army's broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others. Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at Army installations.  The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community."

The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by the NDCEE Technical Working Group (TWG) that includes senior level staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The NDCEE TWG coordinates all NDCEE activities, votes on proposed joint NDCEE projects, and reports back to the EAB Principals.  Working at the tactical levels, three Focus Groups (environment, safety\/occupational health, and energy) were established to develop joint projects.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program participating in the Focus Groups also assists in the formulation of suggested environmental technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative \"shop floor\".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks."

The Project increases operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier and worker health risks and environmental quality impacts that would otherwise result in restoration needs and compliance enforcement actions against installations while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army. The Project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data. Materials and processes demonstrated under this project are inherently more sustainable than the baseline with respect to environmental, safety and occupational health concerns, thereby reducing life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users."

The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), US major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce US acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the US work share that occurs in the United States at US Government and US contractor facilities."

FVL was established in 2009 by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development, as well as retaining long-term engineering capabilities. In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years.  The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing a new aircraft design.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability. \n\nPE 0603801A, Project B47, Future Vertical Lift funding provides for the development of a Capability Set 3 aircraft system within the FVL family of systems.  FVL Capability Set 3 aircraft will conduct Air Assault, Amphibious Assault, Urban Assault\/Security, Attack, Maritime Interdiction, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Humanitarian Assistance\/Disaster Relief (HA\/DR), Tactical Resupply, Direct Action (DA), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations in support of Army, including Army Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Joint forces.  The FVL Capability Set 3 platform will significantly increase speed, range, mobility, and payload over current US Army H-60 and US Marine Corps H-1 aircraft and provide Combatant Commanders with tactical capabilities at greatly increased operational and strategic distances.  The FVL Materiel Development Decision was approved in October 2016.  FY 2017 funding provides for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis and Acquisition Strategy development.  FY 2018 funding completes development and execution of the AoA, acquisition planning and strategy development, and begins development of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Request for Proposal (RFP) and associated plans and other documentation required to support Milestone A decision and RFP release in FY 2019."

Army watercraft equipment enables the conduct of riverine, Logistics-over-the-Shore (LOTS) and Joint Logistics-over-the-Shore (JLOTS), inter and intra-theater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and it's major components).  Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and\/or denied access scenarios.  The Army uses a spectrum of Army Watercraft systems, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intra-theater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to oceangoing and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port\/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems for (LOTS\/JLOTS).  The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, energy efficiency, environmental, regulatory compliance and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will address critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning.  The funding enables our compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.\n\nFY18 funding will primarily support maturation of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) design for the Modular Warping Tug (MWT), support continued integration of Force Protection, and environmental projects."

It supports initiatives that are essential to the development and fielding of modernized TEP sources from Watts to Megawatts level that comply with environmental statues and provide noise and signature-suppressed, energy-efficient, lightweight, deployable and reliable equipment.  FY18 funding will support test and evaluation of technologies for Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP), Platoon Power Generation (PPG), Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (MEHPS), and Management and Distribution Control (MDC).  Also, funding will support a holistic Modeling and Simulation approach to the evaluation of Operational Energy (OE)-related impacts, systems, and improvements; with the vision of reducing Army energy dependency and demand, increasing systems and contingency bases energy efficiency, seeking alternative energy sources and supporting a culture of energy responsibility while sustaining or enhancing operational capabilities.  This includes support of the Joint Operational Energy Initiative (JOEI).  Out years will support investigation of general advancements in engine, power equipment, energy storage, renewable\/alternative energy, and power distribution equipment that are applicable to current equipment and emerging requirements.  In addition, an extensive analysis of commercial generator technology is planned to support requirements definition for the next family of tactical sets.  Programs include costs for developing concept hardware and executing system evaluations at the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events at Ft. Bliss."

The Technology Development programs support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment.  The mission includes developing fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; alternative source water acquisition, reutilization and disposal systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; water purification and waste water treatment and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield."

This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms. This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support."

The ASF-RWS program will help eliminate the need for PMs to pursue customized development of rigid wall shelters to support their individual systems.  ASF-RWS procurements are customer funded by PMs as a cost of their program.

Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness. Programs are aligned to meet future force requirements identified within concept documents and organizational structures. This Program Element also provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans. \n\nThe Projects supported by this PE are: \n\nProject 808 funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and insect control measures. These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug\/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A\/Project 849.\n\nProject 811 funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug\/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug\/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use. Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A\/Project 812.\n\nProject 836 funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with United States (U.S.) FDA regulations. Products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A\/Project 832. \n\nProject VS7 funds program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the fleet of Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The approved force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) companies. All products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A\/Project VS8.\n\nThese Projects are managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.\n\nProject FF4 funded Secretary of Defense approved counterdrug advanced development efforts used in a major re-design of the Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory (FTDTL) information management system used to test urine samples for the presence of illegal drugs. The Drug Testing Program - Client Collection System (DTP-CSS) is comprised of several variations of a desktop application used to select service members for random drug testing, prepare labels for urine specimen bottles, and print corresponding chain-of-custody documents. This Project will standardize DTP-CSS across all services and migrate it to a Web-based system."

In 2010, the U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC Evacuation Package (MEP) from Program Executive Office (PEO)-Aviation. In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission."

The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach that integrates mature technologies to build to the full capability. Air SS reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved laser eye protection, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and tactile situational awareness cueing. Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers."

RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, REP initiatives and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by individual Soldiers and vehicles. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Short Range Micro (SRM), Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotics Payload (ERP) and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support AoA that include Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND Corporation studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the materiel solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document (CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations.  This line also covers pre-acquisition activities intended to reduce risk of not fielding capabilities by the required date, such as market surveys, technical risk assessments, initial development of performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test & evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, early test planning activities, and prototype development activities.\n\nThe Battery Modernization & Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier, and to reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB,), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just three. Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological\nupgrades.\n\nRobotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) includes efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, validate materiel solutions and determine initial studies and analyses in support of pre-materiel development decision activities for emerging requirements and programs of record. RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. Leader\/ Follower (LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Route Clearance & Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Wingman, etc.) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) that include Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the materiel solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document (CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations.

Product Manager ALUGS will lead the development of a LF Software Integration Lab (SIL), in addition to Modeling and Simulation (M&S) efforts, to stress the systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements through validated simulations.\n\nLeader Follower will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. Leader Follower will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles.  Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned. The primary purposes for Leader Follower are to improve Force Protection and increase Logistics Throughput. Funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology."

RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, Robotic Enhanced Program (REP) initiatives and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by individual Soldiers and vehicles. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Short Range Micro (SRM), Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotics Payload (ERP) and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support AoA that include Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND Corporation studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the materiel solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document (CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations.  This line also covers pre-acquisition activities intended to reduce risk of not fielding capabilities by the required date, such as market surveys, technical risk assessments, initial development of performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test & evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, early test planning activities, and prototype development activities."

RD is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&T) projects, and\/or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) into emerging programs of record through development of emerging capabilities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. RD supports early evaluations for operational effectiveness studies of platforms (i.e. Leader Follower (LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Route Clearance & Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II, Robotic Wingman (RW), etc.) to determine Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL). Studies support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) that include Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), RAND studies, and\/or modeling to increase confidence in the materiel solution defined in the emerging Capability Development Document (CDD)\/Capability Production Document (CPD) that support appropriate Acquisition Category (ACAT), Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and office of primary responsibility designations. This line also covers pre-acquisition activities intended to reduce risk of not fielding capabilities by the required date, such as market surveys, technical risk assessments, initial development of performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test & evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, early test planning activities, and prototype development activities.  The Army Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) will build, and test prototype LF systems for safety release, Soldier use, and further technology maturation. Product Manager ALUGS will lead the development of a LF Software Integration Lab (SIL), in addition to Modeling and Simulation (M&S) efforts, to stress the systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements through validated simulations.\n\nLeader Follower (LF) will provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. Leader Follower will provide capability for a manned Leader vehicle with up to seven (7) unmanned Follower vehicles.  Initial efforts by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center will control up to three (3) optionally manned Follower vehicles with a designated Leader vehicle. The manned Leader vehicle wirelessly provides direction and speed guidance to the Follower vehicles to follow the Leader vehicle with no driver input or unmanned.

Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, AoAs are required to be completed for a new start program prior to its first Milestone (MS) Decision. AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document (CDD), Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision which do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity. The Army is projecting to start work on several AoAs beginning in FY 2018, and will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.\n\nFY 2018 funding in the amount of $9.832 million supports of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for new start programs that do not yet have a Program Manager assigned."

AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision which do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity. The Army will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.\n\nFY 2018 funding in the amount of $9.832 million supports of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for new start programs that do not yet have a Program Manager assigned."

The non-prescriptive technical solutions provide maximum technical flexibility for industry to satisfy LTAMD capability requirements related to the implementation of an LTAMD Sensor\/Radar Set to replace the current force (PATRIOT) RS. The knowledge-point-centric assessment approach during the TMRR phase enables the government to down-select to the single best contractor for EMD using best value trade-off determination techniques.  This accelerated TMRR-to-EMD approach will provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat, refine the best materiel solution for LTAMD capability requirements, fosters full and open competition, reduces programmatic & technical risks, and substantially reduces total ownership cost (compared to the baseline RS being replaced by this LTAMD capability)."

Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future systems, and reducing technology risk in order to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs. In Project DS3, Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototypic platforms. Project EX3 funds experimental prototyping and demonstration of ground vehicles to assess future concepts and designs against selected capability trades, and emerging technologies for current and future combat vehicles across the combat vehicle portfolio. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), and US Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and acquisition programs of record to inform emerging requirements for future systems and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are directed by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group (ESG) based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments.  A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototypic platforms. CPE efforts facilitate rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping in a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for early performance verification of new capabilities and transition into acquisition programs. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishing a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in the Project is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), the Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

The CPE will demonstrate the verification and validation of selected weapons platform variations in a way that accurately identifies potential performance and design failures, while also testing and mitigating solutions and multiple trades in a VPG prior to cost-bearing production and manufacturing. The CPE will reduce the cost and the time required for testing and evaluating air and ground vehicle systems, thereby reducing acquisition risk and enabling rapid transition of new warfighting capabilities."

Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten maneuver forces\u2019 ability to conduct operations.  Specifically, maneuver formations require improved air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar (RAM), Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)).  \n\nThis additional capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach that enables rapid fielding of an initial capability, culminating in a program of record that will field a full capability.  Initially, the Army will field an interim, near-term Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) solution using an Army Senior Leader Directed Requirement, informed by a FY 2017 \u201cSHORAD Shoot Off\u201d.  The system or system-of-systems solution will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include Rotary Wing (RW), Group 1 \u2013 3 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Fixed Wing (FW) while keeping pace and surviving with the armored and infantry maneuver forces.  This interim solution will be fielded to one M-SHORAD battalion.\n\nThe FY 2018 will begin the initial interim M-SHORAD capability development and integration of the identified solution into existing maneuver formation equipment.  The interim solution requirements will be identified in an Army Senior Leader Directed Requirement and based on the FY 2017 \u201cSHORAD Shoot Off\u201d.  Efforts will include: hardware\/software modifications and integration of sensors and defeat mechanisms; initial development of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs);  initial development of logistics products to include training requirements; and planning for testing required to obtain a material release.\n\nFY2018 base dollars in the amount of $20,000 million are required to support the analysis and design, integration, and testing of the M-SHORAD solutions."

Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten maneuver forces\u2019 ability to conduct operations.  Specifically, maneuver formations require improved air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar (RAM), Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)).  \n\nThis additional capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach that enables rapid fielding of an initial capability, culminating in a program of record that will field a full capability.  Initially, the Army will field an interim, near-term Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) solution using an Army Senior Leader Directed Requirement, informed by a FY 2017 \u201cSHORAD Shoot Off\u201d.  The system or system-of-systems solution will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include Rotary Wing (RW), Group 1 \u2013 3 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Fixed Wing (FW) while keeping pace and surviving with the armored and infantry maneuver forces.  This interim solution will be fielded to one M-SHORAD battalion. \n\nThe FY 2018 will begin the initial interim M-SHORAD capability development and integration of the identified solution into existing maneuver formation equipment.  The interim solution requirements will be identified in an Army Senior Leader Directed Requirement and based on the FY 2017 \u201cSHORAD Shoot Off\u201d.  Efforts will include: hardware\/software modifications and integration of sensors and defeat mechanisms; initial development of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs);  initial development of logistics products to include training requirements; and planning for testing required to obtain a material release."

Given the urgency of the requirement, existing contracts will be leveraged to the maximum extent possible.\n\nThe Army continues to develop the strategy for the longer-term program of record solution and will request follow-on resources based on emerging plans.  The longer-term process to a program of record may involve additional near-to-mid-term interim solutions using maturing technology prior to the program of record development.

Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated 05 Apr 2010, approved the Positioning, Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on 30 Jul 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on 28 Jul 2014.\n\nPNT is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions, which means Warfighter assured access and integrity to PNT is not guaranteed.  This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.\n\nAssured PNT is a system of systems consisting of one project (ED5) Assured PNT and four separate and interdependent PNT products; (EH8) Dismounted A-PNT System, (EH9) Pseudolite, (EJ2) Mounted A-PNT System, and (EJ3) Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS).  These interdependent PNT products assure access to and integrity of PNT information. Each system provides a degree of standalone capability, but only when deployed together can Assured PNT be achieved in all environments and across all formations and warfighting functions.  Program Manager (PM) PNT manages these four products (Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and AJAS) constructed to develop, test, field, and sustain the A-PNT materiel solution.  The final contracting strategy is under development.\n\nAssured PNT consists of:\n(ED5) - The Assured PNT funding line originally represented the entire program prior to breaking into four funding lines. The FY17-FY22 funding now includes PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing and Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) to legacy GPS systems.\n\n(EH8) - The Dismounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) System is a Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) optimized military Global Positioning System (GPS) and non-GPS sensor suite that acquires and distributes trusted PNT data to soldier-borne systems.\n\n(EH9) - The Pseudolite system provides area protection and PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal.\n\n(EJ2) - The Mounted Assured PNT System fuses military GPS with physics based sensors and timing technology to acquire and distribute secure trusted PNT data to tactical client systems on vehicular and watercraft platforms.\n\n(EJ3) - The Anti-Jam Antenna Systems (AJAS) provides GPS signal point protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through anti-jam technologies. AJAS enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments.\n\nFY 2018 Base funds in the total amount of $164.967 million are provided to continue the development of the Assured PNT program. The ED5 funding line accounts for $23.991 million for PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing, Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) and enhancements of Army PNT capabilities. The EH8 funding line accounts for $14.423 million to support risk reduction efforts for the Dismounted A-PNT System.  The EH9 funding line accounts for $79.230 million for the continuation of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase for Pseudolite.  The EJ2 funding line accounts for $35.300 million to support risk reduction efforts for the Mounted Assured PNT System.  The EJ3 funding line accounts for $12.023 million to support risk reduction efforts for the AJAS."

The Army requires ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions.\n\nPseudolite (satellite-like transmitters) assure GPS access and integrity by providing PNT via terrestrial and airborne-based radio navigation GPS transmitters in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. Area protection is provided through the deployment of Pseudolite transmitters supporting a Brigade Combat Team area of operations. Pseudolite supports continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker, Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions. Pseudolite consists of three segments: \n1.  Pseudolite Transmitter segment provides terrestrial and airborne radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a high power signal.\n2.  Command and Control (C2) segment to control the Pseudolite transmitters on the battlefield.\n3.  Receiver segment, which will develop software upgrades to current and future military GPS receivers to receive and process the Pseudolite signals.  \n\nFY 2018 Base funds in the amount of $79.230 million are provided for the continuation of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase, which includes additional testing and security certification efforts, and development of the Acquisition Requirements Package and other documentation to support the Developmental Request for Proposal Release Decision Point milestone."

Program Manager (PM) PNT manages these four products (Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System, and AJAS) constructed to develop, test, field, and sustain the A-PNT materiel solution.  The final contracting strategy is under development.\n\nThe Pseudolite Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition strategy was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority and Milestone A was successfully completed in May 2015.  The Pseudolite product is currently in the TMRR Phase of the acquisition life-cycle.\n\nThe TMRR Acquisition Strategy for Pseudolites includes: 1) Technology maturation of the Transmitter segment through the use of two prototyping, cost-plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts; 2) Command and Control (C2) segment will leverage the development by other DoD agencies to the greatest extent possible; 3) Receiver segment will make the use of multiple contracts through existing vehicles for Pseudolite Receiver software prototype development."

Army ground maneuver Forces require access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.\n\nMounted A-PNT is a scalable form-factor that distributes PNT data to multiple devices (client systems) on mounted platforms.  The system fuses military GPS with physics-based sensors and timing technology to provide trusted PNT data, which allows the Soldier to operate in GPS degraded or denied environments.  Mounted A-PNT System includes receiver software capable of acquiring Pseudolite signals resulting in additional protection for military GPS in denied environments and paces the threat by including a migration path to Military Code (M-Code) and other future technologies.\n\nFY 2018 Base funds in the amount of $35.300 million are provided to support Milestone B regulatory\/statutory activities to include documentation preparation\/approval, critical risk reduction through focused prototyping with industry and Federally Funded Research & Development Center partners, standup of the Systems Integration Lab to begin early integration with over 40 client systems, and development of the Acquisition Requirements Package and other documentation to support the Developmental Request for Proposal Release Decision Point milestone."

Initial IFPC 2-I system development was funded on this line through FY16. The system will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM defeat mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms. \n\nThe IFPC Inc 2-I second interceptor will expand the Block 1 system's target set by enabling an initial counter - rocket, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) capability through a kinetic intercept capability.  Integration of second interceptor for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1.\n\nFY2018 base dollars in the amount of $11.303 million funds the integration and testing of a second interceptor into the IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 Multi-Mission Launcher."

Initial IFPC 2-I system development was funded on this line through FY16. The system will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM defeat mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms. \n\nThe IFPC Inc 2-I second interceptor will expand the Block 1 system's target set by enabling an initial counter - rocket, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) capability through a kinetic intercept capability.  Integration of second interceptor for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1.\n\nFY2018 base dollars in the amount of $11.303 million funds integration and testing of a second interceptor into the IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 Multi-Mission Launcher."

Provide engineering support to the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) Mission Management Center (MMC) through an associated test-bed for both operational and developmental injection and integration of real- time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture (COP) for Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), Joint Task Forces (JTFs), and Coalition Partners. The MMC injects real-time J-FFT information into the COP for COCOMs, JTFs and Coalition partners. USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD. CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM. USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for Friendly Force Tracking (FFT).\n\nProject FE6:  Details of this program are reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119 (a)(1)."

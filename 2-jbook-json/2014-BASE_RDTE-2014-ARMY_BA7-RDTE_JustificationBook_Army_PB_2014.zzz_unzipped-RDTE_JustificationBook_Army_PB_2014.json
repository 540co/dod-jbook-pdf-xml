                            "val": "Projects 090\/DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS has been deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.\n\nMLRS is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, Precision Strike weapon system that is organic\/assigned to Fires Brigades supporting BCT.  The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  The launcher is complimented by the MFOM to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), and the AFOM, capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 kilometers (km).  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armament and system hardware and software technologies, including COE and NIE, obsolesence mitigation, realiability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications via joint variable message format. \n\nGMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the MLRS and HIMARS launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24\/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  \n\nThe GMLRS Program consists of four separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) that is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and scheduled to enter full rate production in FY15.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.\n\nGMLRS Increment IV is being developed to replace expiring Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles and ATACMS cluster munitions that are prohibited from use by the DoD Cluster Munitions Policy after 31 Dec 2018. It is intended to address the same targets with similar capabilities.  The program is currently in the pre-Materiel Development Decision (MDD) Phase. The MDD is anticipated to occur in 1Q FY2014 with a tentative Milestone A scheduled for 1Q FY16.\n\nThe United States (U.S.) Army funds GMLRS Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) activities from three program codes under the MLRS Product Improvement Program (0603778A) program element; 784-Guided MLRS includes common GMLRS RDT&E activities, 78G-GMLRS Alternative Warhead for GMLRS AW EMD activities, and DZ8-GMLRS Increment 4 for the Technology Demonstration (TD) activities."

The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers.  HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system.  The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for sustainment, obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament and system hardware and software technologies including Contemporary Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE) and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-Army interoperability and digital communications.  HIMARS has been deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units."

Development efforts underway include Enhanced C2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance,increased crew protection IAC, and mitigating obsolescence of the Fire Control System through the FCS-U effort.  The IAC effort, begun in FY 12, fulfills a M270A1 system requirement that enhances the level of crew protection. A contract was awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the government. The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current capability of firing the complete set of MLRS family of munitions per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Obsolescence mitigation activities in FY12 included trade studies to determine the most appropriate architecture for the FCS-U.  The FCS-U effort began in FY13, utilizing the industrial Engineering Services contract that was previously sole source awarded.  Contract efforts includes finalizing design, testing, and qualification of the FCS-U with scheduled completion in FY15.  PDR will occur in FY13 and CDR FY14."

GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.\n\nThe GMLRS AW increment completed Milestone B (MS B) on February 19, 2012 and is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  The three-year EMD contract was awarded on March 30, 2012.  Funding is requested in FY2013 for the second year of the EMD contract and for other government and contracted EMD activities to include engineering developmental testing and the Critical Design Review (CDR).  GMLRS AW is scheduled for a combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision in FY2015 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY2016."

The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers.  HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system.  The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications.  HIMARS has been deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units."

Development efforts underway include Enhanced C2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance, and mitigating obsolescence of the fire control system through the integration of the FCS-U effort on the M142 HIMARS.  The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current capability of firing the complete set of MFOM per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Obsolescence mitigation activities in FY14 include trade studies to determine the most appropriate architecture for the FCS-U. The FCS-U effort which began in FY13 for the M270A1 system, will be integrated on the HIMARS system starting in FY15. Contract efforts include integration, testing, and qualification of the FCS-U with scheduled completion in FY16. Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR) will occur in FY15 with qualified design in FY16.   HIMARS follow-on technology insertion efforts include automotive chassis life cycle enhancements, fire control system obsolescence mitigation and associated enhancements to training devices as improvements when applicable."

BENEFITS: As chartered by the Secretary of The Army, LIW will provide enterprise-accepted and trusted information for analysis, aggregation, and reuse in support of the Lead Materiel Integrator (LMI) mission. As an Army enterprise-level repository and retrieval system to facilitate accurate choices and rapid decision making. Specifically, LIW will provide all required data structured in a way that allows for querying and reporting; e.g., equipment authorizations, equipment on-hand, new procurement schedules, RESET production schedules and in-transit visibility from origin and distribution to final destination, in support of the information needs of the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other command logistics managers. This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's ARFORGEN processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success.ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisy unique command management requirements."

This is an agile development process, where major versions are released on a six-month cycle.  Version 1 was released December 2011 and Version 2 released June 2012.  Version 2 is currently in production and in use by the Army Sustainment Command, with user training underway for Army Commands and other materiel stakeholders.  The first option year was awarded August 2012, and development of Version 3 is underway.  FY2014 base year funding supports Version 5."

                            "val": "Biometrics Enterprise is comprised of two parts:  Biometrics Identity Management Agency and the enterprise data repository called Biometrics Enabling Capability.\n  \nBiometrics Center of Excellence:  DoDD 8521.01E directs the BCoE to conduct biometrics S&T research and engineering for the DoD and other USG sponsors in support of the DoD S&T Roadmap. The BCoE will conduct biometrics test and evaluation activities to include standards conformance testing (which include evaluations and assessments of biometric-enabled IT devices and systems that interoperate with the authoritative biometric database); support DoD acquisition organizations in developmental testing, systems integration, and independent verification and validation; support operational test and evaluation activities that determine system operational effectiveness and suitability; and acquire and conduct COTS and GOTS testing to identify functionality, performance, and conformance to DoD standards.\n\nThe Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) is the Department of Defense's (DoD) authoritative biometric enterprise database repository. The current operational capability is the Next Generation Automated Biometrics Identification System (NG-ABIS aka DoD-ABIS); it will transition to the BEC Increment 0 Program of Record (POR) at the Full Deployment Decision (FDD). NG-ABIS receives multi-modal biometric submissions from collection devices allowing the Warfighter to distinguish friend from foe and enabling near real-time retention, capture or release decisions. The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies in efforts to capture, detain, question and deny access to known and emerging threats to our National Security. Latent fingerprint matching allows the Warfighter to accurately identify and detain those responsible for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), weapons trafficking, and other terrorist attacks against US and partner nation's assets across the globe. NG-ABIS stores, processes, shares and matches four different biometric modalities (fingerprint, facial images, palm-prints and iris patterns) against over 9.5 million records as it searches for known and suspected terrorists, enemies and persons of interest. The system uses advanced algorithms to combine partial matches of multiple biometric modalities in order to increase the frequency of conclusive and automated matches; thereby, decreasing the amount of required manpower.\n\nBEC Increment 1 will build upon the success of NG-ABIS\/BEC Increment 0 and will include a web-based interface and cross-domain security capabilities across the SECRET and UNCLASSIFIED security domains. It will also build upon the current capability with increased matching throughput (number of records that can be processed within 24 hours), increased storage capacity and the ability to process bulk biometric submissions. BEC Inc 1 will have an automated, customizable Biometric Enabled Watch List (BEWL) that will be electronically input into the system and link an individual's record to the watchlist. This will facilitate on-demand access and development of watchlist data and provide match alerts to the collector through their collection system as well as to the intelligence community. This future system will also streamline interoperability and data sharing with government agencies and stakeholders including the Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC), Department of State (DOS), United States Central Command (CENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and other DoD and Federal agencies as required and in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24\/National Security Presidential Directive 59.\n\nBEC Increment 1 is currently conducting Pre-Milestone B acquisition activities to support a Pre-EMD and Milestone B decision reviews planned for FY2014."

The approach begins with establishing the current quick reaction capability as BEC Increment 0 at a Full Deployment Decision.  On 13 May 2011, an ADM designated the Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) as the Full Deployment Decision (FDD) Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), as delegated by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE).  The Capability Production Document that supports BEC Increment 0 was approved on 14 February 2012.  BEC Increment 0 is planned to be succeeded by BEC Increment 1, which will enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase of acquisition with Pre-EMD and Milestone B reviews planned for FY2014, based on a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved CDD being approved in 2QFY2013.  BEC Increment 1 will provide new capability beyond the current Next Generation Automated Biometrics Identification System (NG-ABIS). PM DoD Biometrics is preparing a forward-looking Acquisition Strategy for the BEC Increment 1 Program that is compliant with the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.0 process."

This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  \n\nRadar Digital Processor Development:  Incorporates improvements to mitigate radar hardware obsolescence, improve Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RAM) and improve performance of the PATRIOT Radar Set against evolving threat sets.  This program includes the implementation of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Level 1 \/ Level 2, and a Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) Combat ID technique to mitigate potential fratricide risk, and the development of CONOPS to incorporate the new Combat ID capabilities into system operation.  The RDP also provides the necessary radar processing capability to support follow-on EDP Tasks 6 and 7 to counter emerging threats and provide data necessary to support migration to IAMD.  The RDP is a pre-requisite for migration to an IAMD Netted Sensor.\n\nSIPRNet\/NIPRNet Access Point\/Troposcatter (SNAP\/TROPO):  Provides hardware interfaces to support extended range communications within the battalion (TROPO) and Force Operations interfaces to satellite for access to SIPR\/NIPR worldwide communication networks. \n \nTHAAD PATRIOT Interoperability:  Implements improvements to THAAD\/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network (JDN) deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile (TBM) battle management and force\/engagement operations.  Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint (TADIL J) interoperability. \n \nAdvanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology (DRFM) available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   \n\nInternet Protocol Commo Phase 1 Force Modernization:  Replacement of the current KG-194A encryptors in PATRIOT requires redesign of the basic PATRIOT shelter communications architecture to incorporate new hardware which interfaces the existing IDOCS to new KIV-7M encryptors and provides an IP base backbone for range extension and over the air IP communications tunneling for Force Operations message traffic without impacting the Engagement Operations traffic.\n\nEvolutionary Development Program (EDP):  Provides an integrated approach to maintain and update system capabilities against the evolving threat.  Develops and implements a comprehensive strategy to leverage modernization and upgrade efforts. \n \nTask 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PAC-2\/GEM, PAC-3, and MSE) to counter stressing TBM threats.\n \nTask 6:  Improves discrimination of higher altitude TBM RVs from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor. Longer-range detection and track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the RDP, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PAC-3 and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement missiles.\n\nUpper Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM):  Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the BMDS environment.  Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris."

Each radar system employs a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.\n\nJLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft allowing them to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture."

There is currently no funding beyond Block I.  \n\nOn 28 Jun 05, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) approved the JLENS program for entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) as recommended by the Army Acquisition Executive. The DAB elected to maintain oversight of JLENS as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program as stated in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum signed on August 5, 2005.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, the Acting Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) signed the JLENS Nunn-McCurdy (NM) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) certifying the restructured JLENS Program, and signed a memorandum rescinding the Milestone B approval for the JLENS program, granted on August 5, 2005.  The ADM directs the Army to restructure the JLENS program to consist of two EMD orbits; complete scheduled EMD test and evaluation to include the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air demonstration, Limited User Test, Developmental Test 2, and Developmental Test 3 that concludes in 4th Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 (4QFY2013); and to assist in site selection and planning for the employment of one JLENS orbit in support an operational Continental United States based exercise when a location is determined and orders are approved by the National Command Authority.  Letters were provided to Congress notifying them that the NM review was complete and program was certified and restructured as detailed above.\n\nThe Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) reviewed the results of the Army's 60 Day Deep-Dive employment assessment of JLENS for Homeland Defense.  The JROC concurs with the proposed JLENS employment to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD for an operational exercise duration Fiscal Year 2014-2017."

They are Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) Increment 1 and Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS).  In FY14, the program office will initiate the execution of the AFATDS Increment 2 requirements. \n\nAFATDS provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component\u2019s automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. Additionally, the system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, to include Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems.  \n\nAFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness (SA) data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.  Additionally, the system will pair targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  Also, the system automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  Furthermore, the system will automatically implement detailed commander\u2019s guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. Currently, the system interoperates with the other Army mission command systems, and is being used in operations in Afghanistan. The program office is currently fielding non-developmental, rugged common hardware, running the Windows Operating System. The total force will be fielded a Windows based platform by fiscal year 2013.  Currently, AFATDS Version 6.8 and 6.8.X are being developed and expect to achieve Full Materiel Releases (FMR) in 2Q FY2013 and 2Q FY2015.  With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.X, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 requirements and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  \n\nJADOCS is a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) Targeting, Mission Management, and Common Operational Picture (COP) Windows-based software suite which functions as a complementary system to the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). JADOCS provides integration and synergy between multiple Command & Control (C2) systems of the uniformed services, and joint and combined elements involved in the targeting process and performs coordination and calculates collateral damage. JADOCS Mission Managers support this coordination amongst Warfighter functional areas to rapidly execute critical missions. JADOCS enables coordination and de-confliction of conventional and asymmetric war-fighting missions. JADOCS is fielded to Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Army units involved in the targeting process at Division, Corps and Echelons Above Corps. JADOCS provides the Combatant Commands with the capability to plan and direct theater counter-fire and precision strike operations through the real time synchronization of US and Coalition assets. The application provides the Warfighter with a combination of tools, services and Mission Managers for rapid \"system of systems\" integration, visualization, coordination and deconfliction of critical mission information. It not only enhances Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems in the areas of strike planning but also in SA, joint and combined interoperability and force transition in war."

They are Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) based Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs).  \n\nAFATDS provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component\u2019s automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. Additionally, the system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, to include Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems.  \n\nAFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness (SA) data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.  Additionally, the system will pair targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  Also, the system automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  Furthermore, the system will automatically implement detailed commander's guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. Currently, the system interoperates with the other Army mission command systems, and is being used in operations in Afghanistan. The program office is currently fielding non-developmental, rugged common hardware, running the Windows Operating System. The total force will be fielded a Windows based platform by fiscal year 2013.  Currently, AFATDS Version 6.8 and 6.8.X are being developed and expect to achieve Full Materiel Releases (FMR) in 2Q FY2013 and 2Q FY2015.  With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.X, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 requirements and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  \n\nGPS-based PGMs require pre-launch loading of sufficient GPS Satellite related data down at the Weapon Platform level to enable delivery of Precision Capable Fires.  This hot start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of PGM maneuver authority to ensure required target engagement performance.  This is especially critical for short flight times and steer-early solutions such as Mortar and Cannon based PGMs.  Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due to vertical terrain\/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit Precision Capable Fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the Firing Weapon Platform.   A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature Technologies and taxpayer investments of existing acquisition programs."

Increment 2 will permit the management and targetability of the collective and coordinated target acquisition data, effective selection of munitions-target pairing from indirect fire weapons (land and sea based), as well as fixed and rotary wing aircraft against targets located throughout an area of operations.  AFATDS Increment 2 will be used to actively plan offensive information operations and exploit electronic attack weapon systems through the use of planning tools for effects and the status and readiness of the systems that can best support the commander's intent.  AFATDS Increment 2, through a network of Fires assets, can assist the commander to accomplish these tasks using it at the operational and tactical levels of war from the Soldier, Sailor, and Marine fighting the tactical fight to the operational staff preparing for the future fight.  AFATDS Increment 2 will provide the supported maneuver commander the capability to plan, coordinate, rehearse, and execute integrated networked fires.  Networked fires will include lethal and non-lethal effects producing weapon platforms and the empowerment of knowing, within seconds, the lethal status and availability of the fires platforms within the commander's area of influence, which include air, sea, and land-based weapon platforms.  Net-centricity will enable the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) commander to view targets that adjacent BCTs have encountered or engaged in their area of operations.  This capability enables the commander to:  exploit under-tasked air support assets, view\/task weapons platforms based on coordinated command-supported relationships, and search target data files and repositories.  Using the web-based tools, the BCT commander can access higher command centers via search wizards over Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) portals and internet gateways to the Global Information Grid (GIG). There is an operational need to provide Fires data to a central database repository within the BCT.  That repository will be accessible through network addressing or web-enabled search wizards to locate information relative to a certain maneuver element, within a BCT or adjacent BCTs, thus supporting unified battle command.  AFATDS Increment 2 will provide three distinct applications that interface via Local Area Network\/Tactical Communications Protocol\/Internet Protocol\/User Datagram Protocol(LAN\/TCP\/IP\/UDP) addressing with a common core database and core system functions\/management that resides on a remote battle command server.  The three applications\u2013Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction\u2013will support role-based functionality and provide a less complicated AFATDS package to the Warfighter."

It has been updated with subsequent releases reflecting the Spiral development strategy of the program. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.X in 2Q FY2015, AFATDS Increment 1 will have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).\n\nThe Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) issued a memorandum in June 2011 approving the Capability Development Document (CDD) for AFATDS Increment 2. Additionally in the memorandum, the JROC validated the Key Performance Parameters, assigned oversight authority to the Fires Center of Excellences Fire Support Command and Control Tactical Software Governance Board, and set a funding ceiling. These actions support the use of the emerging DoD 5000 systems acquisition approach for Information Technology (IT) (IT Box model). AFATDS Increment 2 development will follow the IT Box Model for systems acquisition.  AFATDS Increment 2 will be developed using an incremental approach that will employ fielded and emerging digital platforms, communications systems technology and architecture, and spaced-based systems, to virtually interconnect via web-enabled networks to exploit the capabilities of Fires platforms and precision munitions.  Increment 2 will provide a surface-to-surface Joint Fires asset manager building on the existing capabilities and functions of the current fielded AFATDS. It will provide additional targeting and decision aids, Situational Awareness (SA), Battlefield Visualization, Information Operations (IO) management aids, and control\/coordination and synchronization capabilities for all types of Fires assets to include electronic attack. The AFATDS Increment 2, unlike the current increment of AFATDS, will be based on a net-centric application with open modular service oriented architecture and a decentralized processing approach, which will make it effective, flexible, survivable, mobile, user friendly, and simple to maintain. This increment will also be developed to enable the establishment of detached or decentralized work platforms and applications when network services or connections are not available.  Using the current AFATDS Increment 1 software and functionality as a basis, AFATDS Increment 2 will provide three distinct software applications \u2013 Fire Direction, Fire Control, and Fire Support -  that will provide a less complicated AFATDS package to the Warfighter that will simplify training and support ease of use.  The fire direction application will provide the battery and platoon FDC's the functionality to perform mission processing and reporting.  The fire control application will permit the user to analyze the systems in his command supported relationship and supporting units. The Fire Support application will be used for coordination of fires assets within his area of influence primarily at Fire Support Elements (FSEs) and Fire Support Coordination Cells (FSCCs.).  AFATDS Increment 2 capabilities will be developed over three distinct software versions - Versions 6.9, 7.0 and 7.1.  It is planned to award AFATDS Version 6.9 via full and open competition.  The acquisition strategy for the award of the follow on versions of AFATDS software will be determined after the award of the Version 6.9 software Preliminary Design Review.\n\nAFATDS v6.9 will modernize and re-architect the AFATDS software to align with the requirements of the Inc 2 CDD."

The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army approved JADOCS for acquisition program status under the Capabilities Development for Rapid  Transition (CDRT) process. The approved JADOCS Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 16 April 2012, documents the current JADOCS threshold capabilities that are in the field today. As the lead agency for managing JADOCS capabilities within the Department of Defense, the Fires Center of Excellence, tailored the JADOCS CPD to incorporate Field Artillery tasks not included in the currently fielded version (v 1.0.5.1) of the software. JADOCS retirement will occur when system capabilities are individually or collectively incorporated into Army, Service, or Joint programs or are no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users. JADOCS Increment 1 will be managed as an Information Technology (IT) program under the IT Box Construct with periodic software updates. JADOCS Increment 1 will support any software refinements \/ modifications to enable enhancements identified by the Warfighter. Future increments of JADOCS will address operational lessons learned, changes in the Joint Operation Centers (JOCs) and the Joint Information Center (JIC), integrated architectures and optimizing the use of the Global Information Grid (GIG) with web based applications.\n\nThe JADOCS program strategy is to capture and sustain JADOCS capabilities IAW the approved JADOCS CPD dated 16 April 2012. All JADOCS Targeting and Fires capabilities required by the US Army and US Marine Corps, not already in AFATDS, will be captured in the AFATDS Increment 1 product, along with any appropriate interoperability, architecture modernization and web application modernizations that may be needed. All other capabilities will be captured in other Army, Service or Joint programs or otherwise sustained, updated, and enhanced as specified by the Warfighter in future increments of JADOCS (until no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users). An objective of the Increment 1 effort will be to modernize the JADOCS software and develop JADOCS widgets and provide inter- widget communications in accordance with TCM Fires Cells requirements and the requirements of COE. These widgets will support the Warfighting Function (WFF) for the sharing of data and collaboration between unit Commanders and their Staff sections.\n\nA draft JADOCS Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) has been prepared and is currently under review by the HQDA staff.  This ADM will be presented to the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) for review and signature.  It is expected that the AAE will sign the ADM in April 2013.  Under the provisions of the ADM, JADOCS will be established as a formal Army Acquisition Program with milestone decision authority (MDA) delegated to the Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) and entry into the acquisition life cycle at Milestone C.  It is projected that the Milestone C Decision Review will be held in 2QFY14."

This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nThe Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is a materiel solution to support the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) across the Spectrum of Conflict by replacing five mission roles currently performed by the M113 Family of Vehicles (FOV) and integrating the current M113 FOV Mission Equipment Package (MEP) to a modified existing vehicle platform.\nThe Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle Program is submitted under Program Element 0605028A, Project EB5 for the FY 2014 President's Budget."

In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.

The overarching capability includes a user-defined COP with integrated Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA), map-centric collaboration, Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and other enabling system interoperability, data management, and enterprise services.  The suite of products include Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Command Web, Battle Command Common Services (BCCS), and Command Post Client (CPC), that provides the consolidate server and services infrastructure for systems supporting Army Battle Command from Battalion to Army Component Command, Battalion and Above Joint Convergence with the Marine Corps, and Tactical Web Portal for Knowledge management. TMC products and services are compliant with the joint technical architecture.  In addition, this project funds the development of a collaborative Mission Command (MC) environment for ABCS to operate more efficiently and effectively.  The MC environment will serve as a common foundation for functionality development and support by converging onto a common architecture and infrastructure.  MC Convergence\/ Common Operating Environment (COE) development and integration will significantly enhance the ability of commanders and staff to effectively conduct collaborative mission planning and execution across a range of operations and spectrum of conflict."

TMC satisfies requirements and capabilities identified in the Maneuver Control System (MCS) Good Enough Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and MCS 6.4 Capability Production Document (CPD) which includes Army migration to Department of Defense (DoD) net-centric environment.  The overarching capability includes a user-defined COP with integrated Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA), map-centric collaboration, Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and other enabling system interoperability, data management, and enterprise services.  The suite of products include Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Command Web, Battle Command Common Services (BCCS), and Command Post Client (CPC), that provides server consolidation and services infrastructure for systems supporting Army Battle Command from Battalion to Army Component Command, Battalion and Above Joint Convergence with the Marine Corps, and Tactical Web Portal for Knowledge management. TMC products and services are compliant with the joint technical architecture.  In addition, this project funds the development of a collaborative Mission Command (MC) environment for ABCS to operate more efficiently and effectively.  The MC environment will serve as a common foundation for functionality development and support by converging onto a common architecture and infrastructure.  MC Convergence\/ Common Operating Environment (COE) development and integration will significantly enhance the ability of commanders and staff to effectively conduct collaborative mission planning and execution across a range of operations and spectrum of conflict."

The AB3 program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AB3A Remanufacture and AB3B New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, and Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.     \n\nFunds will also provide for the development and testing of the Modernized Rocket Launcher (MRL) with digital launcher electronics.\n      \nFY2015 funding totals do not include any previously requested funding for current FY2014 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) requirements, and no FY2014 OCO funds have been previously requested in the RDTE Project D17.\n\nFY2014 funding totals do not include any previously requested funding for current FY2013 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) requirements, and no FY2013 OCO funds have been previously requested in the RDTE Project D17.\n\nFY2013 funding totals did not include any previously requested funding for current FY2012 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) requirements, and no FY2012 OCO funds have been previously requested in the RDTE Project D17."

These 51 LRIP aircraft will be used for operational testing, First Unit Equipped (FUE), and training base fielding. \n\nIn Oct 2010, a contract for Apache Block III Lot 1 (8 aircraft) was awarded to initiate LRIP.  In April 2012, additional options for Lot 2a (16 aircraft), Lot 2b (19 aircraft) and Lot 2c (8 aircraft) were definitized.\n\nIn early 2012, the existing Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort was modified to incorporate development and testing to support the AB3 Lot 4 and Lot 6 production configurations.\n\nIn FY13, a contract for Apache Block III Lot 3, initiating Full Rate Production, will be awarded with options for Lot 4 and will continue to a total of 690 remanufactured and new build aircraft.\n\nTraining device concurrency will be maintained with each technical insertion. The EMD effort is managed as Cost Reimbursable.  Production efforts will be awarded as Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and include the Advance Procurement requirements.\n\nIn FY13, FY14, and FY15 MRL NRE will encompass US Government (USG) design of the Hydra Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA), modification of the M261 launcher, launcher fabrication, and launcher testing.\n\nMulti-year authority may be requested for the out years."

FY 2014 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) dollars in the amount of $2.833 million provides funding for NRE of CNS equipment that meets current and future air traffic management requirements. The increased performance will permit the Army Fixed Wing aircraft to operate in compliance with other existing and emerging regulations.  As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusion are likely for aircraft not properly equipped.  Upgrade of communication and navigation systems will improve aircraft performance and enhance reliability and maintainability, thereby improving aircraft availability for mission requirements. The associated aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army Fixed Wing requirements for product improvements to support the Army fleet."

It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities to meet the dynamic Army acquisition technology requirements. The strategy applies digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, and provides a clear and accurate common operational picture for leaders at all levels. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability of commanders and leaders to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo.  Digitization is a means of realizing a fully integrated C2\/SA capability to the platoon level, including interoperability links with joint and multi-national ground forces. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts, coordination of interoperability efforts between joint and multi-national forces, and the synchronization of combat material and training efforts to develop Army information technologies; 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software interfaces between and across the warfighting functions and across multiple Program Executive Offices, providing System of Systems (SOS) capabilities that satisfy warfighter requirements and enable the execution of mission operations by providing one Common Operational Picture (COP)\/Common Tactical Picture (CTP). 3) Oversee and support synchronization of LandWarNet Battle Command capabilities and ensure interoperability across the current and future force. 4) Support fielding of integrated systems to Active and Reserve Components (USARNG and USAR) in accordance with Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). 5) Support of the the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and the Continuing Early Validation (CEaVa) programs into a single integrated system. This supports the Army's Equipping Strategy Army Force Generation, ARFORGEN, and consolidates capabilities to gain efficiencies. IAW the National Defense Authorization Act 804 and OSD's report to congress,Army is poised to implement the \"Agile Business Process\" that will result in an iterative and incremental approach to software development and hardware\/software capability integration.  This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army Network."

It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities to meet the dynamic Army acquisition technology requirements. The strategy applies digital information technologies to acquire exchange and employ data throughout the operational environment, and provides a clear and accurate common operational picture for leaders at all levels. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability of commanders and leaders to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo.  Digitization is a means of realizing a fully integrated C2\/SA capability to the platoon level, including interoperability links with joint and multi-national ground forces. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts, coordination of interoperability efforts between joint and multi-national forces, and the synchronization of combat material and training efforts to develop Army information technologies; 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software interfaces between and across the warfighting functions and across multiple Program Executive Offices, providing System of Systems (SOS) integration capabilities that satisfy warfighter requirements and enable the execution of mission operations by providing one Common Operational Picture (COP)\/Common Tactical Picture (CTP). 3) Oversee and support synchronization of LandWarNet Battle Command capabilities and ensure interoperability across the current and future force. 4) Support fielding of integrated systems to Active and Reserve Components (USARNG and USAR) in accordance with Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). 5) Support the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM) and the Continuous Early Validation (CEaVa) programs into a single integrated system. This supports the Army's Equipping Strategy, ARFORGEN, and consolidates capabilities to gain efficiencies. IAW the National Defense Authorization Act 804 and OSD's report to Congress, Army is poised to implement the \"Agile Business Process\" that will result in an iterative and incremental approach to software development and hardware\/software capability integration.  This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army Network."

The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program provides for the upgrade of the PATRIOT System through individual materiel changes.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program upgrades the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capabillity with the emerging threat.  Efforts will be made to expedite PATRIOT materiel solutions (e.g. Radar Digital Processor, Communications Upgrades, Radars on the Net) to both enhance capability and facilitate integration into the Integrated Air Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.\n\nProject 038 Avenger PIP:  The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four STINGER missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun.  The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone.  Avenger is capable of day, night and adverse weather operations, can be transported by Utility Helicopter-60L Blackhawk or C-130 aircraft, is air-droppable and can shoot on the move.  The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit.  The Avenger system is operated by a crew of two to counter hostile low flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles, attack helicopters, and high performance fixed winged aircraft.  The system fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.  \n\nThe Avenger PIP provides for the design, development, integration and testing asociated with modernization and added capability to the Avenger Weapon System.\n\nProject DT5 Stinger Product Improvement: The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  It provides low-altitude defense for ground forces against attack or aerial observation by low-flying Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), Cruise Missile (CM), Rotary Wing (RW), and Fixed Winged (FW) threats.  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)\/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I missiles have extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include ground vehicles and helicopters.  The missile is delivered as a certified wooden round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  \n\nThe Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System."

Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)\/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include ground vehicles and helicopters.  The missile is delivered as a certified wooden round and requires no field testing or maintenance.\n\nThe Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System."

Blk 1 missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CMs), as well as, expired electronics and rocket motors. Under this modification effort, a policy compliant WH will replace the existing M74 bomblets, and also replace electronics and propellant to achieve a reset on the shelf life. This effectively brings the expired inventory back into service, while meeting the DoD CM Policy, to engage imprecisely located targets up to 300 kilometers (km)."

Blk 1 missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CMs), as well as, expired electronics and rocket motors.  Under this modification effort, a policy compliant WH will replace the existing M74 bomblets and also replace electronics and propellants to achieve a reset on the shelf life.  This effectively brings the expired inventory back into service, while meeting the DoD CM Policy, to engage imprecisely located targets up to 300 kilometers (km)."

JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems\/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  Presently, JTAGS is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other InfraRed (IR) satellites. JTAGS then disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning.  The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is a deployable asset.   JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES). JTAGS supports all Theater Missile Defense pillars and by being located in-theater, affords the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.  P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS P3I is on contract for a two-Block development effort.  Block 1 activities (ECD 2013) include Information Assurance (IA) upgrades; Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Automation Track Transfer (ATT) Integration, Initial Geosynchronous Capability (IGC); commercial antennas; Source on Source (SoS) data; and SIPRNET capability. Beginning with FY 2012 funds, Block 2 will be executed in two phases:  Phase 1 deshelters five systems, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-15) and updates hardware\/software\/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities include stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor data and Net Centric capabilities (FY 2015-17).  JROC-Memo 197-12 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Phase I by FY15 and Phase II by FY 2017."

JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems\/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  Presently, JTAGS is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other InfraRed (IR) satellites. JTAGS then disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning.  The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer, but is a deployable asset.   JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES). JTAGS supports all Theater Missile Defense pillars and by being located in-theater, affords the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.  P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness.  JTAGS P3I is on contract for a two-Block development effort.  Block 1 activities (ECD 2013) include Information Assurance (IA) upgrades; Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Automation Track Transfer (ATT) Integration, Initial Geosynchronous Capability (IGC); commercial antennas; Source on Source (SoS) data; and SIPRNET capability. Beginning with FY 2012 funds, Block 2 will be executed in two phases:  Phase 1 deshelters five systems, adds SBIRS Geosynchronous (GEO) scanner capability (FY 2012-15) and updates hardware\/software\/communication systems.  Phase 2 activities include stereo SBIRS GEO starer sensor data and Net Centric capabilities (FY 2015-17).  JROC-Memo 197-12 directs fielding of JTAGS P3I Phase I by FY 2015 and Phase II by FY 2017."

The JHSV program will provide high speed intra-theater surface connector capability to rapidly deploy troops and equipment together and then immediately transition to execute, even in the absence of developed infrastructure, and conduct deployment and sustainment activities in support of multiple simultaneous, distributed, decentralized battles and campaigns.  The primary missions include: support to Theater Security Cooperation Program (TSCP) and Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), littoral maneuver, and seabasing support.  Department of Army (DA) and Department of Navy (DoN) will maintain separate and distinct funding streams to support this joint program.  DA will resource to the critical Army requirement set validated for the joint Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for High Speed Intra-theater Surface Connector (HSC)and the Capability Development Document (CDD) for JHSV .  DA and DoN will focus on the development of common capabilities, each Department will source their unique developmental costs for unique service capabilities that cannot be incorporated into a combined solution set. FY10\/11 funding will procure for the Army Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)\/Integrated Electronic Technical Manuals.(IETMs). FY13 funding will be used for program management support."

The JHSV program will provide high speed intra-theater surface connector capability to rapidly deploy troops and equipment together and then immediately transition to execute, even in the absence of developed infrastructure, and conduct deployment and sustainment activities in support of multiple simultaneous, distributed, decentralized battles and campaigns.  The primary missions include: support to Theater Security Cooperation Program (TSCP) and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), littoral maneuver, and seabasing support.  Department of Army (DA) and Department of Navy (DoN) will maintain separate and distinct funding streams to support this joint program.  DA will resource to the critical Army requirement set validated for the joint Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for High Speed Intra-theater Surface Connector (HSC)and the Capability Development Document (CDD) for JHSV .  DA and DoN will focus on the development of common capabilities, each Department will source their unique developmental costs for unique service capabilities that cannot be incorporated into a combined solution set.

The JHSV would be acquired competitively and production would be based in the United States.  The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) program's updated Acquisition Strategy is currently under development.  The JHSV program Milestone A Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was in April 2006. Milestone B occurred November 2008."

This entails architecture studies,system integration, testing, certification, and accreditation of COMSEC systems and equipment.  COMSEC technology ensures total signal and data security for all Army information systems to include any operational enhancement and specialized Army configurations.  The program also assesses, develops, and integrates COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure posts, camp or station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nG6 OA22 Funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic, key management and information assurance (IA) technologies developed under the direction of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Services, and commercial developers to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to identify fundamental building blocks for Army IA solutions. \n\nArmy Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) to automate the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) key management control and distribution, thereby limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. Numerous software applications are being fielded on separate laptops, thus, burdening the units with the management of numerous laptops. In an effort to reduce the number of laptops in the field, Joint Tactical Network Environment NetOps Toolkit (J-TNT) provides a consolidated platform that hosts the numerous planning, monitoring and network management tools onto one J-TNT box. The J-TNT AN\\GYK-33 V1 system is a laptop platform comprised of a suite of Commerical off the Shelf (COTS) and Government off the Shelf (GOTS) software applications.  The suite of applications provides the soldier the capability to plan, monitor and manage COMSEC, Signal Operation Instruction\/Joint Communications-Electronics Operations Instructions (SOI\/JCEOI), network radio waveform configurations, loadsets and spectrum.  From one platform, the J-TNT system provides the soldier the essential tools needed to complete critical battlefield missions operating on the tactical network.\n\nKey Management Infrastructure (KMI) provides an integrated, operational environment that will bring essential key management personnel and functions in-band. KMI achieves an over the network key (OTNK) management solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The KMI client nodes are the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI System supporting DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives.  The Mission Planning\/ Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MP\/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the Warfighter.\n\nThe Crypto System program supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible."

NSA's aging EKMS infrastructure is being replaced with the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) by Dec. 2017, requiring the transition of 425 Army accounts from FY2013 to FY2017. AKMS supports the transition to the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) during this timeframe. A critical component of this transition is the Mission Planning\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) which creates a secure, highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. Updates to the MP\/MSS Interface Specification and additional capabilities for the interface continue through FY2014. The MP\/MSS Interface Specification defines the interface between the KMI Management Client Node (MGC) and the Mission Planning System operating on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This interface definition covers the key ordering, management, and distribution transactions that were decomposed based upon an Army Mission Planning System collaborating with KMI to fulfill mission requirements in a highly automated manner. \n\nThe additional MP\/MSS capabilities projected to be developed include 1) adding the missing mission planning data fields based on the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) evaluation of Sprint 9\/Release 1, 2) completing the Release 1 backlog along with the other core software requirements related to security, and 3) adding the access controls based on the current login procedures (via medium assurance Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Login\/Password and KMI certificate)."

Local COMSEC Management System (LCMS) completed fielding of software v5.0.3 in FY 2009 to all Communications Security (COMSEC) custodians in order to provide Encrypted Key capability.  LCMS hardware refresh began 2QFY10. Current LCMS software is v5.1.0.5, which completes fielding in 2013. The AKMS acquisition strategy to procure Simple Key Loaders (SKL) was updated in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approved by the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) 3QFY02. Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) began SKL Post Development Software (PDSS) efforts in 1QFY09 and release software upgrades annually.  In FY 2010, an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) was initiated to modify the current SKL design in order to meet emerging requirements of modern end cryptographic units and Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS). Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) is currently undergoing a hardware refresh. Continued enhancements and support of AKMS next generation software tools to meet emerging Army systems' requirements are also underway. ACES is currently operating on version 3.1. SKL is currently operating on version 8.0. AKMS supports the transition from NSA's EKMS infrastructure to the new Key Management Infrastructure (KMI)."

KMI achieves an over the network keying (OTNK) management solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The KMI client nodes are the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI System supporting Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives.  The Mission Planning\/ Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MP\/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the WarFighter. Updates relative to Key Management requirements to the MP\/MSS Interface Specification and additional capabilities for the interface are scheduled to begin in FY2014. The MP\/MSS Interface Specification defines the interface between the KMI Management Client Node (MGC) and the Mission Planning System operating on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This interface definition covers the key ordering, management and distribution transactions that were decomposed based upon an Army Mission Planning System collaborating with KMI to fulfill mission requirements in a highly automated manner.\n\nAdditional MP\/MSS capabilities projected to be developed include 1) registration of MP\/MSS identities, 2) validations required for digital signature based on KMI and other medium assurance Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), 3) allowing the exchange of an electronic equivalent of a signed SF-153 (Hand Receipt, Destruction, Inventory, etc) and 4) integrating MP\/MSS Application Program Interface (API) into the Army Mission Planner - Joint Tactical Network Environment NetOps Toolkit (JTNT)."

This effort will implement a comprehensive logistics automation solution for the field (deployable) and installation level Army and provide the Commander on the battlefield with an integrated, interoperable view of the battle-space in time to support decisions that will affect the outcome of combat operations.  Further, it will allow the Army to meet statutory requirements for auditability.  This solution implements Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products from SAP AG.  This will also allow the Army to retire multiple custom designed stand-alone business software baselines optimized to existing Army business processes and replace them with a single integrated business software baseline that has been optimized to industry defined best business practices.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  It will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system."

The system will be developed in multiple releases as functional capabilities are defined and as integration and synchronization opportunities with related systems present opportunities for subsequent releases.  Release 1.2 will be a viable stand alone capability that will not require subsequent releases to be operational.  \n\nGCSS-Army is being implemented in three releases to ensure program success. \n\nRelease 1.0 replaces: Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) at one Direct Support Unit (DSU) in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), Fort Irwin, California. An Operational Assessment (OA) was conducted on Release 1.0 and information is gathered through Continuous Evaluation. \n\nRelease 1.1 includes: Supply (Tactical and Installation Warehouse and Materiel Management); Field-level and Installation Based Maintenance; Property Accountability (Property Book, Unit Level Supply, and Unit Basic Load Ammunition); Force Element and Defense Forces Public Security (Allows Task Organization of Personnel, Equipment and Associated Property Accountability, Maintenance and Finance Actions); Store and Forward capability; Interoperability with STAMIS systems; Tactical and Installation Finance (Cost Management, Funds Distribution and Execution, Fund Status Reporting, and General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) Data Synchronization); Hub services; and Enterprise Master Data Management. Release 1.1 provides over 80% of the required GCSS-Army capability; it subsumes Release 1.0 and replaces the SARSS, Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE), Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) and Standard Army Maintenance System Installation Enhanced (SAMS-IE) legacy systems. \n\nRelease 1.2 provides enhanced capabilities such as disconnected operations,increased financial capabilities, expanded enterprise master data management and is prepared to interface with an aviation maintenance system. Rel 1.2 does not by itself replace any additional Systems. Rel 1.2 represents the complete baseline with all required capabilities provided."

AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:\n\nEnterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.\nEnterprise Business Intelligence\/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.\nEnterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. \n\nHence, the AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Foxhole thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield."

The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army Landwarnet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies.\n\nThis program is designated as a DoD Space Program."

Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future."

The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. GCCS-A provides a client-server layered architecture and is moving towards a common operating environment (COE) that will enable secure and interoperable applications to be rapidly developed and executed across a variety of computing environments to develop a totally integrated component of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems that integrates the GCCS-Joint picture with the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS). GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection."

DRRS-A is currently implementing the Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFMD-I) for consumption of authoritative force structure data.\n\nBased on Congressional direction (Section 247 of Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)), the Secretary of Defense submitted reports to the congressional defense committees detailing the consolidation of the NECC system with the GCCS FoS. As part of that effort, it was determined that GCCS-A will be included in the modernization of the command and control systems within the DoD under the Joint C2 framework. While sustaining and synchronizing current fielded operations, the Army will modernize and enhance current capabilities to support both the Service and \nJoint warfighters as part of a synchronized, orchestrated DoD wide effort that will transition the GCCS FoS into a more agile, net-centric, service oriented environment.\""

The NECC program was cancelled by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 2 November 2009.  Under current plans, GCCS-A will be modernized to meet the requirements defined in the Joint C2 Capability Development Document (CDD), as well as align with the Joint and Army Enterprise architectures and Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.\n\nGCCS-A must be maintained as a system until replaced by a new joint command and control capability. GCCS-A will be modernized as part of the Joint Command and Control (C2) way forward. In accordance with the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC) Memorandum (JROCM) 145-09 which states, \"The JROC endorses efforts to develop and implement programmatic recommendations to support the \"Do No Harm\" Strategy\", GCCS-A continues to sustain, synchronize and modernize along with the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS). In FY11 the Joint C2 Overarching Integrated Product Team concurred with the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) results and endorsed the proposed modernization of the GCCS FoS. In FY12 the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics approved the Joint C2 Capability AoA recommendations to implement the Joint C2 sustainment and modernization strategy based on creating and maintaining a federated Joint C2 Family of Programs.  \n\nOn May 17, 2012 the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics approved the Joint C2 Capability AoA recommendations to implement the Joint C2 sustainment and modernization strategy based on creating and maintaining a federated Joint C2 Family of Programs. An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was prepared by Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT)) and signed by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on September 7, 2012. The ADM directs that the Modernization Strategy will consist of two separate program efforts. (1) A three-year (Fiscal Years 2012-2015) (FY12-15) Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level with Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and authority to conduct a Materiel Development Decision (MDD) delegated down to Program\nExecutive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Communications - Tactical (C3T), and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure software products, with an MDD no later than (NLT) FY2015 at which time ACAT level will be determined.\n\nIn accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2011, entitled Net Enabled Mission Command (NeMC) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), software capability will be developed in 2-year increments as capability sets designed to Collaborate, Collapse and Converge Mission Command products.  The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems.  This strategy is designed to reduce the physical footprint, logistics support requirements and increase operational efficiency."

This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities.  \n\nSmall Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/GMTI) is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The GMTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors. \n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical \/ Infra Red \/ Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day\/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO\/IR\/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   \n\nProject 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor, currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system.  The TSP system is a complementary system to the aerial and terrestrial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) layers through direct interface with the Distributed common Ground system - Army (DCGS-A) Information and Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes, passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.\n\nProject 123:   The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC\/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

A follow-on production and sustainment contract is planned for award in August 2013 for 3 years that will procure all the remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform and provide system sustainment.  FRP is scheduled for FY13 while S\/W improvements to the current sensors are planned for FY14.\n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) EO\/IR\/LD is a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  It was briefed and approved at the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) in Dec 2006.  A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. FRP is scheduled for FY13 while improvements to the current sensors are planned for FY14.  CSP High Definition (HD) is being cut into the existing payload with a retrofit schedule planned for award in FY13 to bring all of the previously procured CSP baseline systems up to the HD configuration.   \n\nThe acquisition strategy for FY14 software development to improve CSP and STARLite Sensor Processing and Exploitation is to utilize existing contract vehicles."

The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system is a complementary system to the aerial and terrestrial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) layers through direct interface with the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) Information and Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).\n\nThe TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes, passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.\n\nFY2014 Base funding in the amount of $24.691 Million supports TSP Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase contract as well as test and evaluation, program management and engineering costs."

The TSP program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition and was focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform and integration and test of TSP software into the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A). The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that are currently fielded on the Hunter UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program.\n\nThe TSP programs Acquisition Strategy has been modified to accommodate the FY 2012 Appropriation that reduced the 11B Funding Line by $14.100 Million. The TSP program is following an incremental Acquisition Strategy with a TSP Block 0, Block 1 and Block 2. Schedule adjusted in accordance with the TSP Acquistion Decision Memorandum dated 22 Mar 2012.  \n\nThe TSP Block 0 will provide an early TSP operational capability for the Gray Eagle program. \n\nThe TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record that entered EMD in FY 2011.  \n\nThe TSP Block 2 effort will address System enhancements and upgrades as the threat and technology evolves."

The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  \n\nThis system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, annual software releases are integrated into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.\n\nDCGS-A consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record and two Quick Reaction Capabilities.  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program also will develop software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR\/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a key component of the DoD ISR Task Force modernization efforts and a critical Army priority.\n\nDCGS-A software will be tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  DCGS-A's contributions to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.\n\nThe DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a Cloud Processing Architecture.  Main Cloud nodes are placed in data centers strategically located across the globe, while tactical edge Cloud nodes will be integrated within select existing equipment currently on units' Modified Tables of Organization & Equipment (MTOE).  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment\/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  The first DCGS-A Cloud node reached its initial operating capability in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in FY11.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12\/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability will be deployed throughout the Army.\n\nFY14 Base funding in the amount of $27.622 million will be used for the development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Releases as well as the continued development and testing of the of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.   The COE has been directed by the ASA(ALT) and concurred by the Army G3\/5\/7 as a priority effort to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE vision.

The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, annual software releases are integrated into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.\n\nDCGS-A consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record and two Quick Reaction Capabilities.  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program also will develop software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR\/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a key component of the DoD ISR Task Force modernization efforts and a critical Army priority.\n\nDCGS-A software will be tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  DCGS-A's contributions to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.\n\nThe DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a Cloud Processing Architecture.  Main Cloud nodes are placed in data centers strategically located across the globe, while tactical edge Cloud nodes will be integrated within select existing equipment currently on units' Modified Tables of Organization & Equipment (MTOE).  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment\/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  The first DCGS-A Cloud node reached its initial operating capability in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in FY11.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12\/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability will be deployed throughout the Army.\n\nFY14 Base funding in the amount of $27.622 million will be used for the development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Releases as well as the continued development and testing of the of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.   The COE has been directed by the ASA(ALT) and concurred by the Army G3\/5\/7 as a priority effort to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE vision.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the CPCE\/COE will include the continued merger\/collapse of capabilities across multiple Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and the consolidation of hardware used across the BFAs.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of DCGS-A software releases will include continued security enhancements in order to achieve Protection Level (PL) 2 and PL 3 compliance, as well as further investment into capabilities and widget development supporting All Source Intelligence, Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and emerging architectural and infrastructure enhancements. The DCGS-A test program will show a growth from previous years.  The program office will be funding and conducting multiple test events for two distinct software releases.  Testing activities requiring these funds will include Developmental Testing (DT)for Release 3;  Operational Testing (OT) for Release 2 and Operational Test Prep for Release 3; Participation in Network Integration Evaluation and Exercises such as Eempire Challence and ULCHI Freedom; and Certification tests for each software release. The result of these activities all serve to prove out the capabilities in Increment 1 Release 2  and Release 3, and COE Version 2 (COE V2) and COE V3."

That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCG\/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. \n\nDCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance\/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A SW capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was included in the CPD and updated DCGS-A Acquisition Strategy. The CPD was approved by the JROC on 20 Dec 2011.\n\nThe DCGS-A System Engineering Plan (SEP) updated the current development plan and was approved by OASD (R&E) on 5 Dec 2011. The DCGS-A Revised Acquisition Strategy (AS) was approved by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 21 Mar 2012. The DCGS-A Acquisition Program Baseline was approved on 29 Mar 12. The DCGS-A program received a milestone C decision on 29 Feb 2012 and an operational test was completed in Jun 2012. A successful Full Deployment Decision (FDD) for Release 1 Initial Minimum Capability was obtained December 2012.  \n\nPM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with DCGS-A Cloud and POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software development and hardware integration, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts."

DCGS-A enables the commander to achieve situational understanding by leveraging multiple sources of data, information, and intelligence to synchronize the elements of Joint and Combined Arms combat power (maneuver, maneuver support and maneuver sustainment support).  The core functions of DCGS-A are: collection and processing of space, airborne, ground and maritime Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor data; control of select Army and joint ISR sensor systems; intelligence synchronization; ISR planning, reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S) integration; fusion of sensor information, and direction and distribution\/dissemination of sensor information.  It draws information from a wide variety of automated and manual sources; on-board sensors, space platforms, unattended air and ground vehicles, existing and new ISR capabilities, and an assortment of databases to enable the land component commander to execute battle command, synchronize fires and effects, rapidly shift battle focus, achieve situational understanding, protect the force, and employ his forces more effectively.  DCGS-A allows commanders at all levels to visualize and understand the threat and environment, predict threat intentions, execute targeting through targeting support, conduct ISR integration and support Information Operations.\n\nThis project provides for the design, development, integration and test of the DCGS-A system of systems at all echelons, from embedded DCGS-A up to Fixed Site operations.  The effort includes system engineering, software integration and development, test & evaluation, and use of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to develop DCGS-A Mobile systems with common multi-function hardware and software combinations (i.e. user workstations) capable of performing all DCGS-A functions.  Development will focus on common module hardware and software that is scaleable to allow commanders increased flexibility in the intelligence force package deployed such that it can be tailored to the echelon, location, and mission that DCGS-A will be required to support.  Included in the development will be the stand-up of a Federated Systems Integration Lab (SIL) to assess and implement existing and new candidate software applications and components into the DCGS-A baseline design.  A common set of ISR Analysis Tools to support collaboration, exploitation, fusion and collection management will be developed that operate within the construct of distributed, reach operations within the DCGS-A enterprise in order to maximize data access and minimize forward footprint.  This will ultimately result in a DCGS-A design that reduces physical and logistics footprint, eases training burden, and decreases sustainability requirements.\n\nFY09 funds development of Technology Insertion modules providing DCGS-A capabilities into Current Force systems, common module multi-function hardware, Battle Command interoperability and integration and test of new software applications. \n \nFunding for this effort continues under Project 956 beginning in FY 2010."

Capabilities Production Document was approved 14 Mar 09.  To meet the required capability, evolutionary acquisition has been employed to implement the incremental approach outlined in the CPD.  The Gray Eagle UAS is being matured during the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, which includes the development and integration of key components such as the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL), Link-16, and integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), payloads, appropriate Common Aviation Ground Support Equipment and the One System GCS.  PM JAMS is developing the P+ model of the HELLFIRE missile and participating in the integration and test activities for the entire Gray Eagle system.  PM JAMS is budgeting for the procurement of missiles for the fielded systems.  PM Night Vision\/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) under PEO Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS) develops, manages, and competes in the POM and is responsible for meeting all ERMP costs associated for payloads, payload integration, and payload sustainment.  Field Tests at the Electronic Proving Grounds in Ft Huachuca, AZ, and integration tests at the Central Technical Support Facility in Ft Hood, TX, are examples of the tests planned to reduce risk in the SDD phase.\n\nFY2014 and beyond funding allows for the development and integration of Pre-Planned Product Improvements, such as interoperability compliance initiatives and a Universal Armament Interface, and Block upgrades.  These improvements will be implemented through a CPFF engineering services contract and\/or engineering change proposals with the Gray Eagle prime contractor."

                            "val": "The Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhances force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control station.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remove Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products. \n\nA SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch\/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  This equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.\n\nThe SUAS RDT&E budget line includes funding for studies and incremental development\/upgrade of current SUAS capabilities that will capitalize on new technology insertions based on identified user requirements.  Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability, introduced in 2010, which provided data link security, increased the number of communications channels allowing more aircraft to operate in close proximity, extended range through data link relay capability, and integrated gimbaled payloads.  Future enhancements will follow the natural progression of technology and exploitation of improved payloads to meet Warfighter needs.  FY 2014 and future improvements will address enhancements to the system to support Army modernization initiatives and the service emphasis on Squad- Foundation of the Decisive Force.  Development of a government purpose rights control device compatible with current and future SUAS platforms and integrated into tactical networks is required.  Compatibility with Nett Warrior elements will support seamless transmission of data between squad members and adjacent and higher commands.  A communications relay capability for SUAS will extend the operational connectivity of the squad when ground based communications cannot support the ranges due terrain or atmospherics.  The relay capability supports the Aerial Layer Network Transport Initial Capabilities Document for low altitude requirements.  Development of a sensor to shooter capability will link forward edge combatants to organic and supporting fires networks with rapid dissemination of target information and imagery.  Efforts to reduce the workload required to operate the SUAS will free the soldiers to perform their primary mission while retaining the advantages afforded by the SUAS. Improved autonomy, to include GPS and comms denied environments will be sought through leverage of software, processor, and communications enhancements.   \n\nJustification:  FY2014 funds of $2.321 million will provide engineering services efforts and continue to focus on communication link encryption, network integration, interoperability, system vulnerability, and improved flight duration."

The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control station.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remove Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products. \n\nA SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch\/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  This equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.\n\nThe SUAS RDT&E budget line includes funding for studies and incremental development\/upgrade of current SUAS capabilities that will capitalize on new technology insertions based on identified user requirements.  Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability, introduced in 2010, which provided data link security, increased the number of communications channels allowing more aircraft to operate in close proximity, extended range through data link relay capability, and integrated gimbaled payloads.  Future enhancements will follow the natural progression of technology and exploitation of improved payloads to meet Warfighter needs.  FY 2014 and future improvements will address enhancements to the system to support Army modernization initiatives and the service emphasis on Squad- Foundation of the Decisive Force.  Development of a government purpose rights control device compatible with current and future SUAS platforms and integrated into tactical networks is required.  Compatibility with Nett Warrior elements will support seamless transmission of data between squad members and adjacent and higher commands.  A communications relay capability for SUAS will extend the operational connectivity of the squad when ground based communications cannot support the ranges due terrain or atmospherics.  The relay capability supports the Aerial Layer Network Transport Initial Capabilities Document for low altitude requirements.  Development of a sensor to shooter capability will link forward edge combatants to organic and supporting fires networks with rapid dissemination of target information and imagery.  Efforts to reduce the workload required to operate the SUAS will free the soldiers to perform their primary mission while retaining the advantages afforded by the SUAS. Improved autonomy, to include GPS and comms denied environments will be sought through leverage of software, processor, and communications enhancements.   \n\nJustification:  FY2014 funds of $2.321 million will provide engineering services efforts and continue to focus on communication link encryption, network integration, interoperability, system vulnerability, and improved flight duration."

The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II ASARC was conducted 21 Dec 99 and a Milestone III Decision 25 Sep 02.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 02 and all 102 systems were procured by FY2009.  Continued development of the selected TUAV system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL), Communications Relay, Laser Designator, High reliability engine, and reliability upgrades.  Development\/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on a (mostly) sole source cost-plus fixed fee engineering services contract with the Shadow prime contractor.  Development of the high reliability engine is being accomplished through a competitive process."

The aircraft system will be made up of multiple aircraft (minimum of 4) that incorporates high value technologies in the airframe, propulsion, datalink systems, communications systems, and avionics systems.  The system will be common with the Army selection of the Line of Sight and Beyond Line of Sight Tactical Common Data Link and the Universal Ground Control Station.  The aircraft will simultaneously carry multi-functional payloads such as SIGINT, EO\/IR\/LD, and Wide Area Surveillance without degrading time on station. This system will provide dramatic improvements in operational flexibility and mission performance.\n\nFY 2014:  No Funding"

The system shall be a rotary wing unmanned vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft system not conducive to standard airfields but forward deployable to support extended operations in austere environment.  The aircraft system will be made up of multiple aircraft (minimum of 4) that incorporates high value technologies in the airframe, propulsion, datalink systems, communications systems, and avionics systems.  The system will be common with the Army selection of the Line of Sight and Beyond Line of Sight Tactical Common Data Link and the Universal Ground Control Station.  The aircraft will simultaneously carry multi-functional payloads such as SIGINT, EO\/IR\/LD, and Wide Area Surveillance without degrading time on station. This system will provide dramatic improvements in operational flexibility and mission performance.\n\nFY 2014:  No Funding"

JPIv2 development will be informed by prototype collection capabilities. U.S. forces are currently operating unilaterally or in combination with joint, multinational, and interagency partners, to identify unknown individuals and verify the identity of person(s) across the full spectrum of military operations, to include Overseas Contingency Operations. Capabilities proposed for JPIv2 will be configurable for multiple operational mission environments.\n\nFY2014 Core funding supports development activities under an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for JPIv2 program. EMD efforts include: define system of system functionality and interface requirements; complete preliminary design to include both hardware and software; define and develop system maturity, reliability and technical performance measures; develop operational deployment sustainability, suitability and survivability plans; and conduct technical reviews consistent with required system capability. Funds will support Test & Evaluation (T&E) activities under an EMD contract for JPIv2 POR. EMD T&E efforts include: development of test plans against system requirements: conducting preliminary testing of system of system functionality; production of test reports to inform developmental activities; and providing T&E support to scheduled technical reviews. T&E funds will support Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) continuous evaluation of the EMD contractor; test and analysis of the EMD contractor test report; Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) support, and analysis of developmental testing and reports related to interoperability. Additionally, funding will support government civilian labor and operations to include travel, training, supplies, infrastructure, and facility costs."

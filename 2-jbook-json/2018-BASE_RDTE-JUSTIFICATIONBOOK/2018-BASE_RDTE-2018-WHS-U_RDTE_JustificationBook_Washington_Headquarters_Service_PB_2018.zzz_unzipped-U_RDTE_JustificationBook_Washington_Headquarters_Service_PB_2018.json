Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, (USD, AT&L) when it was established in July 2015.  In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the operational control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) with a functional realignment of $148.8 million across the FYDP to WHS.\n\nDIUx funds the acquisition and\/or prototyping of leading-edge technologies from commercially-focused companies (i.e., \u201cnon-traditionals\u201d) from Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and across the country; as well as from traditional defense contractors that either partner with non-traditionals or offer one-third in cost sharing.  DIUx acquires and\/or prototypes these commercially viable technologies solutions, in direct response to particular capability gaps faced by our nation\u2019s warfighters.  As such, solution proposals are assessed to ensure alignment with DoD\u2019s strategic objectives to increase and strengthen our nation\u2019s security."

Initially, this program was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, (USD, AT&L) with functional realignment of $148.8 million across the FYDP to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) beginning in FY 2018.  The DIUx program will fund the development of novel leading-edge technologies emerging from high-tech companies that are not traditional defense contractors.  An objective of this program is to obtain innovative ideas from industry that have low technology readiness and are of high priority to DoD leadership.  Incoming proposals will be assessed to ensure alignment with the DoD\u2019s strategic objectives to increase and strengthen our nation\u2019s security."

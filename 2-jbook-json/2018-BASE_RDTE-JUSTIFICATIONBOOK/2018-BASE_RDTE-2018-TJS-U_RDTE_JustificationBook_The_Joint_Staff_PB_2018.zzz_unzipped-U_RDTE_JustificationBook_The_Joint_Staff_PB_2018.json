The Joint Staff Operations Directorate is responsible for GFM Allocation and is the Functional Manager of the GFM mission applications. Accordingly, the Joint Staff Operations Directorate will employ a joint strategy for efficiently fulfilling Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nThe DoD must quickly transition from legacy systems that promulgate data disparity across the Defense enterprise in order to meet National military objectives that have evolved from large force scenarios to operations that include small-to-full scale activities. As stated in both the NSS and NMS, our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic means. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to seamlessly exchange information in a manner that keeps pace with globally changing threats to rapidly and accurately accomplish force sourcing activities to support SecDef allocation decisions.

                        "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n\n- USSTRATCOM SPACE CYBER\n\n- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and SOF joint training and enabling capabilities that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint collective training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. The enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program will focus efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS), consisting of the Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS), provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO, and multinational partners. The Joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS\u2019s intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners by continuing limited investments to ensure JTLS and JCATS remain relevant and provide reliable, low-cost, small footprint, distributed, and deployable joint training solutions. \n \nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD T2 JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, Interagency training; OSD required training (externally funded): and, administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (SEJPME) program.  JKO expends research, development test and evaluation (RDTE) funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance specific aspects of the training capability as required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nUSSTRATCOM CYBER: The USSTRATCOM CYBER funding provided architecture and analysis support to Space Security and Defense Program (SSDP) and the JOINT SPACE OPERATIONS CENTER (JICSpOC) through Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&A); Trade-Off Analysis; Concept Development; Scenario Development; and Military Utility Analysis.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and Cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements, and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and Coalition Forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard."

The net funding increase from FY 2016 through FY 2018 represents planned growth and internal reprogramming decisions to accelerate development of a cloud-enabled joint training environment.  The funding requested continues to modernize joint training capabilities into a single integrating architecture for Joint Training that is aligned to the DoD Chief Information Officer IT mandates.  Funding supports the development of cloud-enabled modular training application services.  Program intent is to reduce dependence on touch labor, and mitigate the impact of reductions in operation and sustainment funding.  Focus must be maintained to deliver operationally relevant training environments and respond to changes in global security landscape and the warfighter\u2019s operational environment.  JNTC enables the Department of Defense to be responsive to the warfighters\u2019 pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices. In FY 2018, this investment continues expanding capabilities and access for Service and Combatant Command trainers to plan and execute joint training.

The Joint Training Environment is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes, and accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating specific actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience.  This enhances the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  Funding in this account supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  The resulting capabilities enable selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command Headquarter levels.  The funding supports modernization of the Joint Training Environment (JTE) to increase warfighter access to semi-automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE) through web-based, modular cloud capabilities. \n\nThe Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the Joint Force to be responsive to the warfighters\u2019 pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed JLVC enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and CJCS High Interest Training Issues identified in the Chairman\u2019s Annual Training Guidance."

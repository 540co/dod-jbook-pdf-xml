Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research through exploration and discovery provides the unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations. \n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program directed from within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, consistent with the January 2012 priorities document \"Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense\" and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requirements.  This program seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the United States.  Deeper understanding of the cultural and political environments where threats, such as radical actors and regime disruptions, develop supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.\n\nThe Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  The SSBR initiatives support the five aims of: (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation\u2019s best Scientists and Engineers (S&Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.\n\nThe National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  NSSEFF provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows\u2019 work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with DoD laboratory scientists and engineers."

                            "val": "The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) engages the full science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) continuum to ensure the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality STEM personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  STEM degree production compared to U.S. employment projections show that there is likely to be a significant shortage of STEM professionals, especially in computing, information technology, and electronics engineering, DoD mission critical occupations for which NDEP\u2019s continuum of initiatives provides a pool of exceptional talent.  NDEP\u2019s portfolio provides short, medium, and long-term solutions to the perfect storm of workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD\u2019s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.\n\nNDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the integrated STEM\/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU\/MIs) program, synchronized with the Federal 5-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic and Implementation Plans and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan (in progress).  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nScience, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, authentic research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department\u2019s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported ~1,455 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and to date ~900 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission. \n\nNational Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) currently supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF Fellows work with ~100 undergraduate students, ~270 graduate students, and ~150 post-doctoral scholars at their respective academic institutions.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows, with the first selected in FY 2008, provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise. Fellows\u2019 work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific research areas, critical to the development of future DoD technologies.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD\u2019s laboratories and other research facilities.  The NSSEFF program is realigned to PE 0601110D8Z Basic Research Initiatives in FY 2015.\n\nNDEP Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD\u2019s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD\u2019s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD\u2019s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states.  As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.  The PK-12 program is terminated in FY 2014, though portions may transfer to the Department of Education."

STEM degree production compared to U.S. employment projections show that there is likely to be a significant shortage of STEM professionals, especially in computing, information technology, and electronics engineering, DoD mission critical occupations for which NDEP\u2019s continuum of initiatives provides a pool of exceptional talent.  NDEP\u2019s portfolio provides short, medium, and long-term solutions to the perfect storm of workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD\u2019s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.\n\nNDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the integrated STEM\/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU\/MIs) program, synchronized with the Federal 5-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic and Implementation Plans and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan (in progress).  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nScience, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, authentic research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department\u2019s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported ~1,455 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and to date ~900 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission. \n\nNational Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise. NSSEFF Fellows\u2019 work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific research areas, critical to the development of future DoD technologies.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD\u2019s laboratories and other research facilities.  The NSSEFF program is realigned to PE 0601110D8Z Basic Research Initiatives in FY 2015.\n\nNDEP Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD\u2019s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD\u2019s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD\u2019s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states.  As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.  The PK-12 program is terminated in FY 2014, though portions may transfer to the Department of Education."

The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment: 84 percent who have completed their service commitment are still employed by DoD beyond their original service commitment.\n\nOversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: retention scholars who are current DoD employees and recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the DoD.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in DoD labs, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department\u2019s mission.\n\nSince FY 2005, ~1,455 students have participated in SMART at ~ 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2013, ~900 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components."

The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.\n\n\u2022  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work\/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.\n\n\u2022  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.\n\n\u2022  Technical assistance.  These funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU\/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts."

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.\n\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018, and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.\n\nThe Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nThe JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP), 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP), 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and 5) Gun Propulsion (GP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be developed and tested at the small-scale, and for eventual incorporation in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. \n\nThe Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (6.3) programs and\/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way, the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools, multi-point initiation, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and fuze sensor. \n\nThe Joint Fuze Technology Program investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture."

This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges. \n\nThe JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks."

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, that when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include but are not limited to gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow Cook Off threats."

This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  Mature 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.\nUnder the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture."

This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.\n\n\u2022  Research.  The research grants further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university research staff to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.\n\n\u2022  Education.  Minority institutions use education assistance funds to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work\/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.\n\n\u2022  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements and highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.\n\n\u2022  Technical assistance.  HBCU\/MI uses these funds to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU\/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants, and contracts."

The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU\/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.\n\n\u2022  Research.  The research grants further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university research staff to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.\n\n\u2022  Education.  Minority institutions use education assistance funds to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work\/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.\n\n\u2022  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements and highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.\n\n\u2022  Technical assistance.  HBCU\/MI uses these funds to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU\/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts."

Historically, the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions Applied Research program, a FY 2012 new start, in support of the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  Succeed in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations.  In addition, this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&T priority, Data to Decisions, which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets."

                            "val": "The DoD response to a changing threat environment includes an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats.  As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store, and process the data created.  S&T investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely addresses three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example, irregular warfare, non-state terrorism movements, and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region of interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or to advance a particular priority area of that Component.  As a result, the R&E Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs; all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However, there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets, infrastructure, and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements, potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts, operators, and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies, workshops, and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to cross-service Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems, contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person\u2019s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights."

The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition.  The Applied Research program concentrates on the development portion of this collaborative effort, focusing on the development of improved algorithms, relative to FY 2012 state of the art, to be demonstrated and validated in the 6.3 D2D program test bed.  The D2D Advanced Development (6.3) program uses a spiral development model with four-steps.  Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality.  Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem.  A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self-test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems.  Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability.  A Transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition."

Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  To perform dyanmic analysis of asset criticality, and course-of-action analysis alternatives, there is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.

There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation; 1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system\u2019s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypothesis with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research and aid in integrated experimentation and transition to operations to simulate the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity, and to integrate cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain."

The program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PE), the program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0602670D8Z will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis.  Research will address needs in two areas:  modeling and data.  It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and improve methods for collecting data that will facilitate model development and enhance forecasting and analysis capabilities.  The program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. \n\nHuman behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.\n\nImproved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base, facilitate subsequent model development and validation, and address emerging data types and sources."

The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0602670D8Z will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis.  Research will address needs in two areas:  modeling and data.  It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and improve methods for collecting data that will facilitate model development and enhance forecasting and analysis capabilities.  The Program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. \n\nHuman behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.\n\nImproved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base, facilitate subsequent model development and validation, and address emerging data types and sources."

With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research Program Element (PE) seeks to establish a program of applied research that will develop and evaluate the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts with the potential to improve future DoD systems. \n\nThe SEI Applied Research PE will initially have four main research thrusts:  (1) measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods; (2) design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems; (3) models of computational behaviors; and (4) cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  These thrusts have known military applications and can be associated with active areas of basic research.  The SEI Applied Research PE seeks to translate this promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs.  This PE will leverage the expertise of the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) in advanced technology development and technology transition to design, develop, and improve tools, prototypes, and new processes that meet general requirements for software-intensive DoD systems.\n\nThe SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance."

Funding levels in each thrust area may vary from year to year.  Research will address the goal of assisting the DoD to retain a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries in the area of software-intensive systems.  The four main thrust areas are:\n\n1) Measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods.  Modern tools, integrated development environments, and software engineering processes have captured large data sets about development activities.  This thrust seeks to study the metrics that affect cost, schedule, quality, and performance based on real-world observation and experiment.  \n\n2) Design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems.  The commercial world has many successful examples of software ecosystems, but the DoD has not capitalized on these to the same extent.  This thrust looks beyond implementing ecosystems in a DoD context and seeks to implement the underlying principles in a way that makes automated creation, evolution, and scaling of ecosystems easier.\n\n3) Models of Computational Behaviors.  System performance depends on end-to-end models of computational behavior that include the user, architecture, source and object code, firmware components, and processor hardware.  This thrust seeks to study emerging ideas that better model end-to-end computational behavior.  \n\n4) Cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  Cyberwarfare is an increasingly important and rapidly evolving dimension on the modern battlefield.  This thrust seeks to investigate methods that will give the DoD enduring advantages in the cyber battlespace such as reverse software engineering, automated code & malware analysis, code-level software resiliency (e.g., randomizing and time variant techniques), and other techniques such as those found in the Software Security Assurance State-of-the-Art Report.  \n\nThe SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance."

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.\n\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Offices (PEO) for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.   The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior DoD and DOE laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.\n\nThe Insensitive Munitions effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nThe JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.\n\nThe Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO\u2019s and\/or Industry, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.\n\nThe JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&T communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.   These Fuzing technologies will be incorporated in weapon applications to demonstrate their maturity and utility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts \u2013 providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.\n\nThis effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nThe Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include but are not limited to gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact, and Slow Cook Off threats."

Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&T communities.  These four capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture."

                            "val": "P206, Explosive Ordnance Disposal\/Low-Intensity Conflict (EOD\/LIC).  The EOD\/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD\/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO\/LIC).  With a decreased budget, CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD)subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department\u2019s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.\n\n P207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits, leverages, and integrates DoD\u2019s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors, tagging and tracking devices, data infiltration\/exfiltration, remote delivery, and mobility\/delivery of sensors), while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies, integrates, and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements, including emerging requirements, and maintains DoD\u2019s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance. \n\nP208, Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain, albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z.\n \nP209, Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and other partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary\u2019s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  As evidenced by every applicable Defense and National Security strategy document, (e.g., 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), \u201cSustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense, Irregular Warfare capabilities are vital to U.S. security.  CTTSO, in coordination with the ASD (SO\/LIC), is in the process of reviewing options to continue the IWS capability that is critical to the combating terrorism community."

Deployed an enhanced training capability and planned for transition to a program of record a counter- \u201cgreen on blue\u201d capability for ISAF and U.S. forces. This effort assisted warfighters in detecting and mitigating insider threat attacks in partner, COIN and contingency operations, which is a serious issue that undercuts efforts at training host nation security forces, one of the pillars of Irregular Warfare.   Continued to support an Advanced Situational Awareness Capability that includes instructor-led training and supporting publications for tactical unit leaders at the US Army Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE), Ft. Benning, GA.  This capability led to trained units achieving the highest IED discovery rates in the OEF theater and saving coalition lives. This capability was ultimately transitioned to the US Army MCoE and they currently seek to enhance this capability with the training to counter \u201cgreen on blue\u201d violence that was previously mentioned in a hybrid training course. Continued to support Project LEGACY, a capability that significantly improves host-nation police counterinsurgency and military intelligence capabilities. Conducted and completed a spiral effort of Legacy to provide training that institutionalizes within U.S. Forces and the Interagency the capability developed by the Legacy Program to deliver police\/military investigative training to host nation security forces.  Conducted an assessment of the relevance and applicability of specialized Security Force Assistance doctrine and operational approach for environments outside Operation Enduring Freedom.  Continued to elicit and refine requirements for users within rapid assessment framework in order to successfully pair SOF and Interagency users with off the shelf, high performance technologies and novel capabilities that fulfill specific requirements to share and analyze operational data better and faster.   Continued to research and develop threat group assessments based on open source information that allows operators and decision makers to understand the threats associated within their various areas of operation globally and how these threat groups affect the global security of the US and its allies.  Continued to develop and expand an effort that integrates and fuses heterogeneous social media data for use in strategic and tactical operational planning and preparation of the battlefield with new end users and different support environments. This effort provides a real time data and analysis capability along with mentorship and the analytical tradecraft to understand and monitor critical events and sentiments in open source social media.  Continued to develop frameworks and training to better understand and implement Combatant Command (COCOM) -level Communication Activities.  Delivered Return on Investment Analytic Framework for the COCOM VOICE Program in order to assist in garnering quantifiable measurements of performance, measurements of effectiveness and methods of determining overall return on investment (ROI) of program dollars.  Additionally, this effort also developed training designed to equip decision makers and operators with the knowledge and skills necessary to properly utilize population data and avoid common traps and risks in order to assess and appropriately interpret the population research required in support of these Communications Activities. Conducted deep-dive research and analysis aimed at defining today\u2019s and the near future\u2019s typology of adversaries, their capabilities, intentions, use of terrain, weapons, technologies, proliferation schemes, U.S. technology and operational advantages adversaries will work to offset, and what the U.S. should be looking for to be better prepared when it faces off with these types of threats.  Assisted with further development and understanding of the US Marine Corps concept of the Intelligence Driven Combat, to include international partnership and exchanges with Israel.   Developed enhanced MISO\/PSYOP capabilities in planning, targeting and execution for support to special and unconventional warfare mission requirements.  Researched and started development of enhanced mobile capabilities for assessing and surveying assault and landing zones to support small units conducting distributed operations in remote and austere environments (to include resupply\/drop zones, refueling, and helicopter landing zones). Conducted research, development, operational analysis, and field experimentation of efforts intended to counter emerging and extant threats in the intersection of the digital-physical domains (such as understanding the usage of social media by transnational criminal organizations in order to predict changes in support and influence; measures of effectiveness of social media and understanding how to use this media for intended effects). \nInitiated the Secure Unclassifed Network (SUNet), which provided protected dynamic enclaves of capability for multi-agency users (Law Enforcement, Interagency, Defense, Coalition, and Foreign Nationals) in order to provide inter-organizational collaborative areas and enhanced capabilities of data upload, searching and sharing from headquarters down to smartphones, tablets or laptops.  Research and development of a non-material effort intended to better understand indirect and irregular threats currently facing the US, and how to implement effective measures against them. The studies and related activities undertaken for this project will fall under three broad lines of effort: 1) an analysis of indirect\/irregular actions employed historically and how these capabilities may be applied to today\u2019s threat environment; 2) an analysis of current and the evolving irregular threat environment; and 3) identification and analysis of which of the capabilities the US could apply to prevail against irregular\/indirect threats now and in the future.  Initiated a research and development effort to assess the degree and quality of organizational learning, adaptation, and innovation in the field over the course of the deployment of specific units engaged in IW; provide an initial framework to speed up and enhance organizational learning in the field; and operationalize framework through instruction\/education aids."

                            "val": "The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S., interagency, and international users through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support;  Training Technology Development; and a new working group, Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. \n\nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program.  However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products.  \n\nIn FY 2013, CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces in demanding or hostile environments such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. \n\nFor U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  \n\nFY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan accelerates, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces.  Additionally, CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM\u2019s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Specifically, CTTS will address personnel and physical security for small forces deployed to austere and hostile environments. In parallel, CTTS is increasing its support of the USMC as they reconstitute and improve the capacity and capabilities of the Marine Expeditionary Units.  Another area of increased emphasis that has become even more concerning will be the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  \n\nCTTS will continue to actively support the Department\u2019s Homeland Defense mission at NORTHCOM, including Defense support of civil authorities, interagency coordination, Special Operations support, and security cooperation.  Consistent with that focus, this office will also work to address Department of Defense Security requirements for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment."

                                            "val": "The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S., interagency, and international users through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support;  Training Technology Development; and a new working group, Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. \n\nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program.  However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products.  \n\nIn FY 2013, CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces in demanding or hostile environments such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. \n\nFor U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  \n\nFY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan accelerates, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces.  Additionally, CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM\u2019s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Specifically, CTTS will address personnel and physical security for small forces deployed to austere and hostile environments. In parallel, CTTS is increasing its support of the USMC as they reconstitute and improve the capacity and capabilities of the Marine Expeditionary Units.  Another area of increased emphasis that has become even more concerning will be the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  \n\nCTTS will continue to actively support the Department\u2019s Homeland Defense mission at NORTHCOM, including Defense support of civil authorities, interagency coordination, Special Operations support, and security cooperation.  Consistent with that focus, this office will also work to address Department of Defense Security requirements for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment."

The FCTs enhance interoperability, facilitate international collaboration, expand opportunities for prototyping and enable more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding (RF), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  The FCT projects are sponsored by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements and DoD priorities, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  \n\nSince the program's inception in 1980, OSD has initiated 671 projects; 619 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 324 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 252 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.\n\nThe FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the United States.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the United States defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects."

The original version used a thin steel barrel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a carbon fiber outer sleeve.  External steel parts were eventually replaced with aluminum alloys or plastics thereby reducing the weapon weight from 36 pounds to 21 pounds.  At 21 pounds the weapon is extremely heavy, especially when also carrying 84mm ammunition.  This M3A1 project will eliminate 6 pounds (28 percent) from the existing system by replacing various components (bolt, trigger, venturi, and ancillary parts) without changing the firing procedures, operations or ammunition.  Since the weapons\u2019 operational characteristics will not be changed, this low risk approach will produce a lighter weight 84mm shoulder fired weapon without going through a costly and time consuming process to test, qualify, and re-certify an entirely new modernized weapon system.  This is continuing project which was previously funded during FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z."

The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The DoD funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD\u2019s relatively small annual investment leverages DOE\u2019s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP seeks to develop:  improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example: design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation and materials characterizations; higher power and safer energetic materials (EMs)(e.g., explosives and propellants); miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons\u2014such as penetrators\u2014that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.\n\nThe JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:\n\n\u2022\tAdvancing munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.\n\u2022\tReducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.\n\u2022\tRapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today\u2019s conflicts.\n\u2022\tEstablishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.\n\u2022\tAiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.\n\u2022\tDeveloping advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.\n\u2022\tDeveloping safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n\u2022\tThe JMP is the primary provider of high performance, physics-based, structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics modules, run on massively parallel computer systems, and the Department can obtain source codes to modify the tools for individual Service needs.  According to the FY 2014 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 82 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The CPU (central processing unit) hours for CTH alone grew by eight fold between FY12 to FY14 (from 63 million CPU hours to 584 CPU hours).\n\u2022\tA significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.\n\u2022\tCheetah, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.\n\u2022\tThe Army Research & Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.  For example, DOE codes were used to analyze the fusible plug for Excalibur, saving the department close to $2 million dollars.\n\u2022\tThe Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.\n\u2022\tNew munitions\u2019 case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.\n\u2022\tThe Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  new compact, lightweight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.\n\u2022\tAn erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.\n\u2022\tA novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.\n\u2022\tReliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).\n\u2022\tRobotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot, to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies.\n\nThe JMP works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors. In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.\n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process. The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. Executive and technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments. The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas: Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies."

The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD\u2019s relatively small investment leverages DOE\u2019s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP seeks to develop: improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example:  design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation; higher power and safer explosives and propellants; miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons\u2014such as penetrators\u2014that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.\n\nThe JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:\n\n\u2013 Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.\n\u2013 Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.\n\u2013 Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today\u2019s conflicts.\n\u2013 Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.\n\u2013 Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.\n\u2013 Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.\n\u2013 Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCG conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans. DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCG to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n\u2013 The JMP is the primary provider of high performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  According to the FY 2010 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 70 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.\n\u2013 A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.\n\u2013 CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.\n\u2013 The Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads. The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.\n\u2013 The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.\n\u2013 New munitions\u2019 case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.\n\u2013 The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including: compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.\n\u2013 An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.\n\u2013 A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.\n\u2013 Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).\n\u2013 Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. \n\nThe JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.\n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies."

Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies; new EM formulations; a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance; and computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.\n\nBoth Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases, the only means to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.\n\nThe Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.\n\nThe desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in large part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality and safety.\n\nThe Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  We may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.\n\nThe specific projects in the energetic materials technical focus area are:\n-  Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.\n-  Insensitive munitions and surety.\n-  New energetic materials formulation and characterization.\n-  Cheetah thermochemical code development and experiments.\n-  Micro- and nano-energetics synthesis and initiation.\n-  Hazards analysis of energetic materials.\n-  Reaction processes of energetic materials.\n-  Microfluidic reactor synthesis of sensitive explosives.\n-  Energetics chemistry and properties.\n-  Microstructural and kinetic effects on energetic materials behavior.\n-  Microwave sensitization and initiation of energetic materials."

Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.   Projects in this focus area support the Department\u2019s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems; trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems; increasing reliability through redundancy (use of two or more smaller initiating systems); and upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. \n\nThe miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.\n\nThe specific projects in the initiators, fuzes, and sensors technical focus area are:\n\n-  Firing systems technology: FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.\n-  Safe, Arm, Fuze and Fire Technology: Initiation & Detonation; Advanced Firing System Components.\n-  Advanced initiation systems: diagnostics development, microdetonics, miniature initiation systems, and detonators for enhanced safety.\n-  Thermal Battery Performance Modeling.\n-  MESASAR synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors.\n-  Vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) sensors for proximity fuzing."

Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and\/or components.  These objectives are achieved by: identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.\n\nThe specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:\n\n-  Predictive materials aging including: solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.\n-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.\n-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.\n-  Complex system health assessment."

These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating and is now happening quicker than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.\n\nThe use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronic components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned aircraft systems, also strongly enabled by electronic components are proliferating and pose a threat both as military capability and as potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  \n\nTechnological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare, Information Operations, and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and\/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly, JEAT established three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation\/demonstration, 2) advanced technology development\/verification, and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture."

These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating quicker than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.\n\nThe use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronic components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), also strongly enabled by electronic components are proliferating and pose a threat both as a military capability and as a potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  \n\nTechnological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare, Information Operations, and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways; rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and\/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly, JEAT established three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation\/demonstration, 2) advanced technology development\/verification, and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture.\n\nExperimentation\/Demonstration:\n\nVigilant Hammer - A recurring multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) venue of increasing complexity and difficulty which advances the state of the art for the detection, classification, geolocation and prosecution of electromagnetic signals of interest using DoD and national resources.  The event will be modeled after the BLACK DART and Trident Spectre venues, and will include scripted and free play scenarios intended to give participants an opportunity to identify synergies and incrementally build capabilities to engage threats.  Engagement (Hammer) payloads will be developed and vetted through distributed electronic effects development. \n\nAdvanced Technology Development\/Verification:\n\nDistributed electronic effects development \u2013 A laboratory and developmental construct that will assess emerging Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies, allowing more effective coordination of sensor and electronic attack capabilities to deliver multi-point, collaborative EW services to warfighters. Distributed electronic effects development will seek to identify and match technologies together that have natural synergies and produce more capability than the sum of the individual capabilities.  \n\nSoftware Programmable\/Spectrum Diverse Electronic Attack (EA) Capability \u2013 Opportunities exist to adapt existing technology used for communication and other purposes into highly configurable EA capability.  This technology will help counter adversary movement into advanced military purpose digital electronic systems.  Beginning in FY 2014, JEAT began to adapt software configurable communications technology to be used as part of a distributed, networked, EA capability that can be readily adapted for installation in a wide variety of host platforms.\n\nInnovative Technology Exploration:\n\nAdaptive\/Asymmetric Technology \u2013 This effort directly supports ASD(R&E), Director EW and Countermeasures (EW&C) by performing analyses and studies of emerging asymmetric threats.  Past efforts under this JEAT project include the Aircraft Survivability Equipment Joint Analysis Team and the Helicopter Survivability Task Force, both of which resulted in significant strategic technology investments by the Department."

These unfused sensors create a serial information stream which can induce an inadequate response to the threat.  Federated systems consume weight, space, and power which are at a premium in small platforms.

However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to a more balanced approach that will continue to address COCOM needs in conjunction with initiating broader, longer-term JCTDs to address DoD\u2019s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems.  The JCTD Program will begin to employ developmental and operational prototypes to address these longer-term DoD priorities.\n\nThe shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD\u2019s strategic initiatives will tend to be longer and larger, with less focus on transition and partner funding.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more impactful JCTD projects. \n\nIn FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations (Project P264) funding will be transferred from Program Element (PE) 0603648D8Z (Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)) to PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis & Concepts)."

The value and impact of the JCTD Program is to cost-effectively address the COCOMs\u2019 priorities and the Department\u2019s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems through developmental and operational prototyping.  JCTDs provide key partnerships with the Department, Services, and other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with the potential to close validated warfighting capability gaps.  The JCTD Program typically demonstrates solutions in two - four years and has a transition rate to the warfighter greater than 80 percent.  At least 57 JCTD projects supported Operation Enduring Freedom, 74 projects supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 30 percent of JCTD projects involved partner nations.  These JCTD partnerships also enable interdepartmental cooperation and joint capability development (e.g. Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Justice).  In FY 2013, the JCTD Program successfully demonstrated and transitioned several key warfighter capabilities that address operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.\n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n\u2022 The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See \u201cSection D.  Acquisition Strategy\u201d for more details on transition.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program delivers capabilities rapidly and projects execute far quicker than the traditional DoD Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered \u2013 or would have been significantly delayed \u2013 if not for the JCTD program.  Recent examples include: \n1. A robust \u201cdetect and track\u201d capability of \"dark\" (i.e. non-emitting) maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.\n2. An operational, internet-based, open-access, Arctic-focused, environmental research and decision-support system that enables local, regional, and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.\n3. A vastly improved capability for U.S., NATO, and Coalition naval forces boarding operations, data collection, and sharing of time-critical boarding and biometrics information during an international operational assessment in April 2013.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has established priorities for Anti-Access\/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to the warfighter today.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  \n\u2022 Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned have been key metrics:\n1. JCTDs typically transition capability within 24 - 36 months with initial spiral products and deliverables in less than 24 months. \n 2. The JCTD program has been achieving transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all, or components of the demonstrated JCTD, going to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by DoD users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned."

However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to a more balanced approach that will continue to address COCOM needs in conjunction with initiating broader, longer-term JCTDs to address DoD\u2019s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems.  The JCTD Program will begin to employ developmental and operational prototypes to address these longer-term DoD priorities.\n\nThe shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD\u2019s strategic initiatives will tend to be longer and larger, with less focus on transition and partner funding.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more impactful JCTD projects. \n\nIn FY 2015, funds will be transferred from the JCTD Program Element (PE) to establish a new PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis & Concepts)."

The value and impact of the JCTD program is to cost-effectively address the COCOMs\u2019 priorities and the Department\u2019s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems through developmental and operational prototyping.  JCTDs provide key partnerships with the Department, Services, and other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with the potential to close validated warfighting capability gaps.  The JCTD Program typically demonstrates solutions in two - four years and has a transition rate to the warfighter greater than 80 percent.  At least 57 JCTD projects supported Operation Enduring Freedom, 74 projects supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 30 percent of JCTD projects involved partner nations.  These JCTD partnerships also enable interdepartmental cooperation and joint capability development (e.g. Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Justice).  In FY 2013, the JCTD Program successfully demonstrated and transitioned several key warfighter capabilities that address operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.\n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n\u2022 The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See \u201cSection D.  Acquisition Strategy\u201d for more details on transition.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program delivers capabilities rapidly and projects execute far quicker than the traditional DoD Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered \u2013 or would have been significantly delayed \u2013 if not for the JCTD program.  Recent examples include: \n1. A robust \u201cdetect and track\u201d capability of \"dark\" (i.e. non-emitting) maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.\n2. An operational, internet-based, open-access, Arctic-focused, environmental research and decision-support system that enables local, regional, and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.\n3. A vastly improved capability for U.S., NATO, and Coalition naval forces boarding operations, data collection, and sharing of time-critical boarding and biometrics information during an international operational assessment in April 2013.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has established priorities for Anti-Access\/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to the warfighter today.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  \n\u2022 Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned have been key metrics:\n1. JCTDs typically transition capability within 24 - 36 months with initial spiral products and deliverables in less than 24 months. \n2. The JCTD program has been achieving transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all, or components of the demonstrated JCTD, going to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by DoD users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned."

TEDS focuses on exchanging data from Army and Marine Corps C2 Authoritative Data Sources for the C2 and Battlespace Awareness domains.  The efficiencies gained will be the reduction of redundant software being developed across multiple programs and the ability to seamlessly exchange data within Military Services as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and coalition partners who adopt UCore.  Transition of the C2 Core extensions and Web services for translation and semantic mediation is planned for Programs of Record in the Army and Marine Corps.  The output of TEDS will enable C2 systems to migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture environment."

BWA also predicts greater performance and signal strength at several different positions versus current whip antennas, including the limiting prone position.  BWA will replace four distinct whip antennas, totaling over five pounds, necessary to cover the same communication band.  BWA weighs three lbs creating a lighter load and increasing operator maneuverability by dispersing weight around the waist.

In these cases, existing program documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the Program of Record.\n- The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring Program of Record changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  \n- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.

The Director, JCTD Program, maintains and provides overall programmatic oversight for the JCTD program, to include the individual JCTD projects.  The JCTD performance metrics center on how fast relevant joint and\/or transformational technologies can be demonstrated and provided to the joint warfighter.  These metrics are driven by the overall business process which includes six parts:  (1) selection focus; (2) ability to spin-off spiral technologies; (3) time necessary to complete a final demonstration; (4) adequately resourced projects with appropriate oversight; (5) capability to complete an independent assessment of the technology; and (6) the number of successful capabilities that are actually transitioned to the warfighter.  \n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include:  all JCTDs will deliver products within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of Implementation Directive signature.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to Programs of Record (POR), sustained residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration Schedule.\n\nTransition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) stated goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing POR, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completions successfully transitioned."

Today's Warfighter rely more and more on communications networks to support and enable actions from targeting and shooting weapons to video-conferencing.  Though military basic infrastructure capabilities follow the mainstream commercial internet, for many reasons (security, mobility, and robustness), commercial telecommunications especially commercial wireless (tactical edge) communications are not well-matched with the requirements of today\u2019s warfighter.  These trends will continue as the military data load becomes more diverse and heavy.  These tactical edge technology challenges cut across all warfare domains (space, air, ground, and sea).  In response to recognized technical problems today, as well as anticipated problems in the future, this research will focus on two key problems in networked technologies:  the need for \"Joint interoperability\" and  \"expanded reach\" (resilient and robust) where no communication infrastructure exists.  The main research objectives of this program are to:\n\n\u2013 Perform Network Communications Analysis to establish the scientific foundations for tactical mobile networking with a specific emphasis on integrating heterogeneous Networks and Integrated Network Operations (NetOps) for tactical networks.\n\u2013 Complete the enhancements of joint integrated capability to predict performance of heterogeneous communication networks and expand the reach\/connectivity and capacity. \n\u2013 Jointly manage and operate existing and planned diverse communications networks, services and applications.\n\u2013 Create mature products for transition to programs of record (POR) or directly to field.\n\t1)  Wireless mobile network design, development and operations, spectrum management, information assurance and information dissemination management software tools.\n\t2)  Joint Aerial Layer Networking (JALN), services and applications packages including hardware and software systems and integrated\/joint network operations software tools and new information architectures.\n\nThis research provides the technical basis to standardize the implementation of military network communications capabilities in the areas of joint airborne network gateways and network communications analysis across the military services, Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and defense agencies."

                                            "val": "Tactical Mobile Networking - As studies have suggested, for instance, the National Research Council\u2019s Network Science Report (2005) and Army Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) JASON's Report (January 2006), the type of networking projected to meet military tactical requirements is not supported by network theory, network design, and analysis tools.  This research will define those technical parameters important to military tactical mobile networking environments, investigate the status of network design and analysis tools, and evaluate how modeling and simulation is conducted to support tactical mobile networking environments.  The role of network experimentation with respect to network modeling will be explored.  Further development and analysis will be conducted to improve the awareness of the condition of tactical mobile networking technologies.  Design tools, architectures, and technical approaches will be recommended to acquisition programs as a result of this research.  \n  \nNetwork Management Tools and Analysis - Network management in the commercial world is a highly organized, synchronized activity that has excellent tools to monitor activity and repair disrupted networks as needed.  These same tools are ill-matched for management in the wireless world, and specifically for military tactical mobile networking.  In addition, the military tactical mobile networking environment lacks the infrastructure (connectivity) and support (helpdesk) because resources (spectrum, people, and equipment) are scarce (not in harm's way).  As the complexity of networking grows and as network capabilities are introduced, improved network management is required.  For military operations, assured delivery may be needed for specific information and operations.  This requires management tools to be in place to ensure continued secure and robust operations, which is not achieved with commercial wireless technologies.  This research will assess network management tools in place for the military tactical mobile networking environment and develop technology and tools to address shortfalls with the goal to transition technology to operational systems.   \n  \nSpectrum Management Tools and Analysis - For wireless, tactical mobile networking, the management of the use of spectrum effects network operations.  The demand for spectrum is increasing due to the expanded use of sensors, imagery, and voice.  This demand increases the pressure on the limited shared radio frequency (RF) spectrum for military tactical networking.  The current Department of Defense (DoD) frequency planning and management infrastructure will have a limited ability to cope with this demand through operational planning, Coalition Joint Spectrum Management Planning Tool (CJSMPT) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD), and the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS).  Advanced spectrum management concepts such as sense and adapt, spectrum sharing, and dynamic reallocation are under investigation but not yet mature support operations.  This research will evaluate opportunities for more efficient and effective use of the frequency spectrum within DoD.  Technology advances are expected to advance the concept of cognitive radio and cognitive antenna devices to sense and adapt operations based on spectrum policy and usage, the management of multi-band and multifunction apertures, and the use of spectrum efficient waveforms for use in military environments.  This research will develop the models and tools to demonstrate capabilities for operational planning and monitoring of spectrum as these technologies are introduced.  \n  \nIntegrated Network Management Capability - Network management becomes more complex as more and different types of networking capability become available.  Integrated network management across heterogeneous systems, especially wireless systems, requires definition, design, and development.  Operationally, network management assumes all functions required to share networking resources and ensure proper operation for participants.  This research will define integrated network operations tools for all aspects of network resource management and to prioritize across operational spectrum management, security management, network management, and information management.  This research will also develop test beds especially to validate models and simulations used to develop and test network management tools, and conduct experimentation on approaches developed. \n\nTactical Networking Evolution and Expansion - Fielded and about-to-be-fielded tactical networks can be vastly expanded and evolved from their current capabilities by developing and applying new techniques (or existing techniques developed in basic research) to the existing systems, providing modern capability to the warfighter without the large expense to the DoD of developing new systems.  This research will focus on developing and applying new DoD specific techniques to create leap-ahead approaches to Anti-Jam resistance of tactical networks, larger, more fully exploited networks, and expanded capabilities for signal\/data processing and data compression in radios and across the networks.  This research will take advantage of new software defined radios about to be fielded by the Department, as well as focus on the existing legacy systems, using the successful approach we developed when fielding the Netted Iridium capability."

Historically, the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions program in support of the FY 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  succeed in counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorism operations.  In addition, this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&T priority, Data to Decisions, which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets."

                            "val": "As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  This is in part due to Department of Defense response to a changing threat environment where there is an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats.  From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store and process the data created.  Science and Technology (S&T) investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.\n\nThe OSD Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely address three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example, irregular warfare, non-state terrorism movements, and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region on interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or to advance a particular priority area of that Component.  As a result the R&E Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs, all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However, there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets, infrastructure, and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements, potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts, operators and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies, workshop and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems, contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person\u2019s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights."

The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition.  The Applied Research program concentrates on the Development portion of this collaborative effort, focusing on the development of improved algorithms (relative to FY 2012 state of the art) to be demonstrated and validated in the 6.3 D2D program test bed.  The D2D Advanced Development (6.3) program uses a spiral four step development model.  Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality.  Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem.  A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self-test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems.  Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability.  A transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition."

However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained advanced development in both cyber security and computer network operations to mature new concepts to harden key network and computer components to include: designing new resilient cyber infrastructures; increasing the military\u2019s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks; disrupting nation-state level attack planning and execution; measuring the state of cyber security for the U.S. government; increasing our understanding of cyber as a war-fighting domain; and providing modeling and simulation of cyberspace operations to explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. \n\nThe Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element is budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it focuses on the maturation of successful applied research results, and their development, into demonstrable advanced cyber security capabilities.  The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program will build on the results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research (0602668D8Z), and other programs, to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of an attack from an advanced persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance metrics. \n\nThis program focuses on integrating computer network defense (CND) and computer network operations (CNO), in addressing the advanced persistent threat (APT), filling DoD technology gaps as identified in the Cyber Science & Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap, as determined by assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E))."

The link between the Cyber Applied Research and Cyber Advanced Technology Development PEs is intended to create a mechanism to take existing basic research results and mature them to the point of incorporation into technology demonstrations.  This program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing joint problems in cyber operations, and filling capability and technology gaps as determined by assessments in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering.  Progress and results are reviewed by the Cyber S&T Community of Interest.\n\nEfforts of the program will develop improved and demonstrable capabilities through the DoD science and technology (S&T) organizations within and across the following technical areas:\n\nINFORMATION ASSURANCE AND COMPUTER NETWORK DEFENSE (IA\/CND):\nDevelop technologies to harden DoD network components; evolve from network defense to mission assurance; and enable systems to operate through cyber attacks in degraded and contested environments.\n\nCOMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS (CNO):\nDisrupt adversary attack planning and execution; explore game-changing ideas over the full spectrum of CNO and new concepts in cyber warfare; increase collaboration between disparate research communities within CNO; and address identified gaps in DoD CNO S&T to prepare for cyber conflict against advanced persistent threats.\n\nBeginning in FY 2013, the program will expanded research in cyber command and control to provide warfighters and commanders new situational awareness, course of action analysis, cyber operational agility and cyber mission control.  This research will include protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  The six new technical thrust areas include:\n\nFOUNDATIONS OF TRUST\nRESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE\nAGILE OPERATIONS\nASSURING EFFECTIVE MISSIONS\nCYBER MODELING, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTATION (MSE) \nEMBEDDED, MOBILE, AND TACTICAL ENVIRONMENTS (EMT)"

There is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques, to perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course-of-action alternatives.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.

The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools and prototypes.  Work under PE 0603670D8Z is focused on developing and demonstrating general-use, cross-domain tools in two areas: computational modeling; and sociocultural behavior data collection, management, and dissemination.  Research will result in more effective cultural understanding in existing intelligence, influence operations, and operations planning systems; modeling capabilities for forecasting reactions to U.S.\/coalition actions; demonstration of strategic decision making tools that highlight political, religious, cultural, and related factors; tools and technologies enabling more widespread and effective use of sociocultural behavior models in operations and mission rehearsal; and toolsets that can be used as strategic decision making tools to account for sociocultural factors."

By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.\n\t\t\t\nDMS&T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.\n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design\/qualification\/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.\n\nThe total sequestration reduction executed as a result of the FY 2013 DoD appropriation act was -$.4.438, of which -$3.430 was applied to FY 2012 and -$1.008 was applied to FY 2013.  Sequestration of these amounts impacted the ability of the OSD Defense-wide ManTech program to execute DoD and Administration priorities for Advanced Manufacturing by  investing in fewer manufacturing processes and improved materials, which are intended to drive in affordability for reduction of system life-cycle costs of major weapons systems."

Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.\n \t\t\t\nData calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements and down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including \"above the shop floor\" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level."

In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements\n\n- Innovation Manufacturing Institutes (IMI) (previously Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Institutes) (see program  descriptions addressed above): \n  1) IMI for 3D printing:  The institute accomplished a first-year, start-up phase consisting of establishing over 80 industry, academic, and non-profit members, creating a balanced governance structure to engage industry and government stakeholders, development of performance metrics, a project call process, an operating plan, the hiring of full-time staff, and completed renovations of the headquarters, the Innovation Factory.  A Call for Projects resulted in six applied research projects, engaging over 35 member organizations on project teams.  The Additive Manufacturing technology roadmap was developed using results generated from a series of workshops with members.  A  Second Project Call was launched with anticipated awards totaling $9 million (government share).  Plans for education and workforce training and outreach were developed, and initiatives were launched in these areas.  The IMI for 3D printing began the development of a new public and private (members-only) collaborative website for secure exchange of relevant information on projects, member organization capabilities, and developments in the additive manufacturing industry.\n\n  2) IMIs for digital manufacturing and design, and for lightweight metals:  Provided resources for initial staffing of each Institute, permitting timely standup of the Institutes to facilitate growth in membership and customer interest.  Awarded initial cooperative agreements. The Technology Advisory Boards of these Institutes were established along with operating procedures on governance, intellectual property protection, and membership. Began cross-institute project teaming with the 3D printing IMI, and began engagement with organic (depot) manufacturing communities within DoD. Executed the initial Project Calls and awarded first round of projects, typically $1M in government funds matched 1:1 or better by industry. Contracts were awarded in the following core areas for each Institute: \n  IMI for digital manufacturing and design: advanced manufacturing enterprise, intelligent machines, and advanced analysis; \n  IMI for lightweight metals: applications of new\/novel metals and alloys, primary metal manufacturing processes, secondary manufacturing processes, and development of products exploiting lightweight and modern metals.\n\nOther projects executed (space limitation precludes project details below, but further descriptions are available):\n\nAutomated Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) Analysis of Composite Ultrasonic Inspection Data for Manufacturing Quality Control\nCarbon Nanotube Cables\nConnecting American Manufacturing\nCurved Transparent Ceramics\nLaser Assisted Consolidation of Composites\nMulti-function Periscope\nOn Tool Inspection of Automated Fiber Placement"

This program will reduce the cost of the current radar system by $1M per ship set, and will fit into the existing TRS-3D top side and below decks available footprint. The open architecture configuration will allow upgrades for new technologies over the lifetime of the program as well as offer lower cost via the potential for open competition for the radar\u2019s building blocks.  Radar manufacturing and support capability will be transferred from a foreign company to a domestic company and facility.  Transmit\/Receive (T\/R) module packaging cost will be reduced through near-hermetic, commercial Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) packaging and automated Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly techniques, reducing touch labor costs.  Model Based Enterprise (MBE) concepts will be integrated to ensure supportability and technology refresh via an Intelligent Technical Data Package.  The commercial packaging effort for T\/R module components as a part of this program will have a direct impact on the Volume Search Radar (VSR) on CVN-79 \u2013 creating a $1M\/hull cost savings for the Navy.  This effort will provide the Navy with the first truly open architecture radar solution that will be able to accommodate different Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technologies, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) technologies, processor, and power supplies from multiple vendors.  The system will use fiber optics to connect the above-deck equipment (antenna) with the below-deck equipment (signal processing and control) which will allow greater flexibility in location of below-deck equipment (allowing a lower center of gravity and thus improved ship stability)."

The size, weight, power, and cost components of conventional atomic clocks are too high for tactical applications. Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) provides improved long-term frequency stability that gets integrated into long-term time accuracy. The focus of this project is leveraging Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) investments in the CSAC technology to reduce operational costs and transition beyond custom fabrication of the current CSAC.  Objectives include improving the existing batch manufacturing processes such as atomic cell filling, cell sealing, physics package assembly, and sub-system testing to reduce the \u201ctouch hours\u201d required for CSAC assembly and testing. Development of a network of multiple vendors to foster competition and ensure a viable supply base is a complementary goal. Current manual assembly processes can produce CSAC in small quantities with low yield at high cost ($8,000\/unit).  The DMS&T funding enables producibility at an affordable cost ($100\u2013$300\/unit). Successful performance enables an environment of continued operation of critical C4ISR systems, regardless of the presence or absence of global positioning system (GPS). The ability to rapidly reacquire GPS military code in a hostile Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) environment is an additional targeted benefit."

These efforts provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nSilicon Carbide (SiC) High Efficiency Power Switches: Another emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development is for Silicon Carbide High Efficiency Power Switches to enable a new class of power electronics that allows flexible new architectures at higher voltages, higher frequencies, less volume \/ weight, higher temperatures, higher efficiency (reduced fuel consumption), and better power quality for Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems and the Air and Missile Defense Radar Radar Power Conversion Module.\n\nMini Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and ManTech for SWIR Imagers: Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC)-less SWIR imagers are being developed that are smaller, use less power, have a lower cost than currently available SWIR imagers, and offer improved functionality over sensors presently in use.  These new SWIR imagers will be used by warfighters including SOF to see target designation lasers during day and night, to identify friend or foe at long range at night, and to operate with covert lasers.  Applications include several night vision and targeting system programs with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and SOCOM.\n\nManufacturability of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs): One emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development focuses on the manufacturability of VCSELs. This effort will allow the enhanced use of high-power laser diode technologies by reducing their operational cost, increasing their reliability and yield, and improving their large array scalability without substantially increasing the processing and packaging requirements. Will apply a modern factory approach of a fab-less front-end with specialized in-house process steps, allowing more flexibility for DoD procurement cycles and leveraging installed, previously-invested capital. This project is expected to benefit numerous programs, including: PUMA, RAVEN, TigerShark, Anubis, Spectre-FINDER, Speckles, TigerMoth, WAAS, PAWS, IPODS, AngelFire, MAV-OBAT, nLoss, LOS-short, CLRF, JETS, IDNST, TLDS, Big Safari, OEF, OIF,  STINGER , and ARGUS.\n\nFuture efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, radars, conformal sensors, and solder free electronics.\n\nOrganic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) Microdisplays: Many applications of microdisplays require extremely high brightness and contrast in order to see sensor imagery in challenging high brightness environments. Existing technologies are limited by low contrast, bulky and complex packaging, and high power consumption. Recently developed methods of direct patterning and Silicon On Insulator (SOI) allow color OLED displays to have large color gamuts and very long lifetimes at high luminances. Direct pattern color OLED on SOI has been successfully demonstrated; however, proliferation is limited due to high costs and manufacturing deficiencies.

These efforts will provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nAdvanced materials manufacturing technologies undergoing development include materials for ballistic survivability and materials for rapid fabrication of structural components.\nCold Spray Deposition: The objective for Cold Spray Deposition is to create a proven repair process and original equipment manufacturer applied corrosion\/wear prevention treatment for magnesium gearbox housings and parts on numerous platforms. Inability to repair is causing significant readiness, sustainment, and safety issues (20% of the fleet is affected at any given time).

Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  These manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nWith our adversaries forced to innovate rapidly to survive, it's become increasingly important for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.\n\nEmerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  Large-scale, challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between government and contractors.\n\n\nMTConnect Challenge: Focuses on developing enterprise manufacturing solutions (tools) using newly developed MTConnect interoperable protocol, for use on machining platforms and manufacturing enterprise communication development. MTConnect is an open communication standard that provides the capability to pass data from enterprise components to higher level systems for further processing using the XML based standard.\n\nFramework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT): Producibility analysis tools will be matured so that component performance, manufacturing processing techniques and cost can be simultaneously considered to achieve an optimum design solution.  Current producibility analysis tools do not reuse and connect existing design, manufacturing and cost models. Sustainment and Maintenance will be impacted by maturing advanced sustainability analyses operating within FACT to reduce sustainment costs associated with spare parts acquisition and weapon system maintenance.  The technology will enable correct selection of a manufacturing process to minimize cost given the estimated spare part lot sizes. Block Upgrades or Recapitalization using FACT will be critical for performing analyses associated with integrating new requirements into an existing platform to highlight the manufacturing and lifecycle costs associated with the necessary changes to the weapon system in order to meet new operational requirements.\n\n40mm M433 Warhead Producibility: This effort will improve anti-personnel lethality at the squad level, increasing grenadier first shot effectiveness against personnel targets.  Optimization of production process prior to transition to Full Rate Production will enable avoidance of significantly high cartridge unit costs.  New manufacturing process\/techniques will be established to embed discrete fragments into over molded warhead bodies, replacing deep drawn pre-formed manufacturing techniques. Low Velocity 40mm M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) Grenades do not meet lethality requirement stated in FM 23-31.  The grenadier, an integral part of the squad, lacks lethality from the M433 HEDP grenade. The M433 HEDP lethality is restricted by the warhead manufacturing process and design. A new warhead design and manufacturing process is required to achieve lethality requirements and to increase lethality overmatch of the squad.  Currently the M433 HEDP warhead is a deep drawn body with pre-formed fragments.  The deep drawn warhead body, although cost effective, produces inconsistent fragment sizes, weights, and patterns which reduces warhead lethality.\n\nLoading ALIMX-101 into 500 LB General Purpose Bombs: A promising new Insensitive Munitions, IM,  explosive has been selected for implementation into the 500 LB General Purpose Bomb used by the Navy and Air Force so an efficient manufacturing process needs to be developed early in the acquisition cycle in order to avoid costly delays in fielding the new IM-compliant system."

To support these goals, Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMI) will serve as regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial application and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.   Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DoE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of the IMIs will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The concept of these institutes is highlighted in the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report titled \u201cCapturing Domestic Competitive Advantage in Advanced Manufacturing,\u201d published in July 2012.\n\nIMI for 3D printing: The focus of the 3D printing IMI is to accelerate additive manufacturing technologies to the U.S. manufacturing sector and increase domestic manufacturing competitiveness by: 1) Fostering a highly collaborative infrastructure for the open exchange of additive manufacturing information and research 2) Facilitating the development, evaluation, and deployment of efficient and flexible additive manufacturing technologies 3) Engaging with educational institutions and companies to supply education and training in additive manufacturing technologies to create an adaptive, leading workforce, 4) Serving as a national institute with regional and national impact on additive manufacturing capabilities, 5) Linking and integrating US companies with existing public, private or not-for-profit industrial and economic development resources, and business incubators, with an emphasis on assisting small- and medium-sized enterprises and early-stage companies (start-ups). The 3D printing IMI was established in 2012.\n\nIMI for digital manufacturing and design: Advanced design and manufacturing tools that are digitally integrated and networked with supply chains can lead to 'factories of the future,' forming an agile U.S. industrial base with significant speed to market advantage. A national institute focusing on the development of model-based design methodologies, virtual manufacturing tools, and sensor and robotics-based manufacturing networks will accelerate innovation in manufacturing, increasing U.S. competitiveness. The digital manufacturing and design IMI will provide the proving ground to link promising information technologies, tools, standards, models, sensors, controls, practices and skills, and then transition these capabilities to the industrial base for full-scale application.  For example, proving and progressing intelligent electro-mechanical design and manufacturing capabilities from laboratory to prototype factory environments would improve production efficiencies and costs. The focus is the smart and comprehensive use of the \u2018digital thread\u2019 throughout design, production and support.\n\nIMI for lightweight metals: Advanced lightweight metals possess properties comparable to traditional materials while enabling much lighter components and products. A national institute will scale-up research to accelerate market expansion by applying integrated computational of materials and manufacturing approach.  New structural alloys face tremendous barriers to application due to lack of design guides and certifications as well as cost and scale-up challenges. The goal is to develop an advanced lightweight-metal U.S. supplier base, and to enable DoD to realize significant fuel reduction, increased payloads, and greater speed and agility of manned, unmanned, and soldier systems as well as benefits for commercial applications and energy savings. \n\nTwo additional IMIs will be established in FY 2015, focusing investments in the key technical areas of Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.\n\nEach Institute is projected to be financially self-sustaining within a five year period of performance."

The IMI will conduct further technology strategy workshops on a continuing basis to gather member input and continue to refine the Additive Manufacturing National Roadmap.  Technology transitions and technology dissemination will continue to institute members and to the general public.  Additional workforce development activities will take place.  The online portal and knowledge base will be further developed to allow for continued membership engagement and collaboration.  Small businesses will continue to be engaged with use of the Innovation Factory facility, and training activities will be developed.  Institute economic development activities and institute performance metrics will be measured.\n\nIMIs for digital manufacturing and design, and for lightweight metals: Expand the membership of both Institutes and promote inter-institute cross-membership and collaboration across the IMI network. Develop and expand upon the commercialization and utilization of FY 2013 and FY 2014 projects. Analyze US and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies, to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements.  Award fourth round of project contracts in the key core areas for each Institute, which are:\n    IMI for digital manufacturing and design:  advanced manufacturing enterprise, intelligent machines, and advanced analysis.\n    IMI for lightweight metals:  applications of new\/novel metals and alloys, primary metal manufacturing processes, secondary manufacturing processes, and development of products exploiting lightweight and modern metals."

The framework is guided by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering, the DASD RF, and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office science and technology objectives and focus areas.  With an emphasis on interagency and service partnerships, initiatives are developed to pursue risk-reducing prototypes and demonstrations in order to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span a two to four year period, typically at a cost of less than $4.000 million, and are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within the project timeline.  During FY 2014, the ECTD Program enhanced its focus on rapid prototyping of high-payoff technologies.  This program element has evolved from exclusive support of force transformation activities to the activities described above, which are more closely aligned with departmental goals."

With an emphasis on interagency and service partnerships, initiatives are developed to pursue risk-reducing prototypes and demonstrations in order to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span a two to four year period, typically at a cost of less than $4.000 million, and are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within the project timeline.  During FY 2014, the Emerging Capabilities Technology Development Program enhanced its focus on rapid prototyping of high-payoff technologies.

Pelican served as a non-deployable technology demonstrator that integrated several innovative technologies into a rigid aeroshell, variable buoyancy (RAVB) air vehicle.  The project\u2019s goal was to mitigate long-term technical risks by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to assist the development of future heavy-lift, airship programs.  The technology may enable the development of a nascent class of air vehicle which will reduce the energy use per ton-mile of airlift operations, permit high-payload operations directly into and out of austere regions with little infrastructure and enable long-endurance manned or unmanned air operations.  The key technologies demonstrated include: a buoyancy control system called Control of Static Heaviness (COSH), a rigid, lightweight-composite internal structure, a low-speed\/hover control system and ground handling capabilities that allow operations without a traditional airship\u2019s ground handling crew.  This project and its inherent technical progress were also monitored by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and United States Transportation Command."

The flagship project for this portfolio is Thunderstorm, an enduring multi-Intelligence technology demonstration for the Office of Secretary of Defense, interagency partners, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, academia, government laboratories and commercial vendors.  Thunderstorm demonstrations provide an opportunity to evaluate and assess the capabilities of new, prototype, emerging and transformational ISR technologies, and related information collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) capabilities in mission-related, geographically, and operationally relevant environments prior to full-scale employment.  Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, post-demonstration assessments and data evaluation serve to inform future DoD ISR concepts of operations and remote PED capabilities.  Thunderstorm aims to identify new capabilities and\/or new ways to employ existing capabilities that enhance our ability to \u201cDeter, Predict, and Interdict\u201d threats while assessing how to bridge capability gaps that cross multiple Departments and Agencies."

The highlight of this Spiral was the capability to share information in near real-time among eight data nodes.  Spiral 13-2 built upon lessons learned from Spiral 13-1, placed emphasis on the maritime-to-land transition activity and the ability to prosecute suspicious actors as they quickly meld themselves into urban or rural populations.  This information was gathered and then shared in near real time to the data nodes.  In FY 2013, Thunderstorm spirals demonstrated 28 emerging capabilities in operationally realistic environments with a broad range of potential operational users providing support.\n\nIn the space arena, a classified project in partnership with the NRO successfully demonstrated the ability to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment for transferring large data files from theater to the U.S.  The project used a COTS SATCOM High Data Rate Modem to improve the bandwidth throughput by 100 percent.  This was a prototype demonstration and this concept of operations will be adapted to other satellites."

Spiral 14-1 is a stand-alone threat convergence analysis designed to explore existing and nascent technology in an effort to expose threats to our national security; specifically those described as \u201cBlack Swan\u201d events.  Spiral 14-1 is intended to be a precursor to FY 2015 Spirals.  Spiral 14-1 will be conducted in March 2014.  Spiral 14-2 is a Distributed Tabletop effort that is directly associated with the 14-3 Field Demonstration and focuses on Countering Chemical and Biological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Spiral 14-2 Distributed Tabletop exercise will be conducted in February 2014. The Spiral 14-3 Field Demonstration will take place in the southeast United States in the Spring\/Summer 2014.  Key operational partners include the JIATF-S, USCG, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), CBP, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), USN Intelligence Community (IC),  Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), NRO, NGA, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical and Biological  Defense, and Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\n\nIn the space arena, projects focus on increasing satellite utility, prototypes, developing transformational satellite capabilities for the tactical user and efforts to improve space situational awareness.  With the high value and long lead time to replace space assets, the goal is to preserve and protect these capabilities.\n In FY 2014, a project is underway to assess emerging technologies for managing the space environment.  Specifically, the project will provide a critical overview of credible technologies, prototypes, and concepts for understanding, observing, and managing the space environment through space debris mitigation, commercial space situational awareness capabilities, and space-based orbital servicing.  Other projects under consideration for FY 2014 include Flume, a software system that aims to enhance the speed of ISR data link communications for Global Hawk, and Multi-INT Activity Learning and Inferencing for Space Threat Prediction (MALISTP), a software system that produces indications and warnings of threats to space assets, attribute estimation, change detection, and proximity analysis."

New prototype efforts in FY 2014 include: Advanced Countermeasure Prototype Phase III \u2013 Forward Operating Base (FOB) and Convoy Active Protection System (ACP Phase III: F&C APS) which will provide an active protection system against rocket propelled grenades for ground assets\u2014FOBs and vehicles; and establishment of a focus on Electromagnetic Environmental Understanding, which will allow tactical units to automatically identify and exploit electromagnetic spectrum or signals of interest.  A project under consideration in this focus area is Quantum Weak Value Amplifier (QWVA), which will amplify electromagnetic signals of interest.  Other potential new prototype efforts in FY 2014 include Small Fast Interceptor, a classified program addressing Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) capability gaps, and North American Arctic Next Generation Over-the-Horizon Radar (Arctic OTHR), which will demonstrate and mature advanced bi-static and multi-static OTHR concepts and techniques to support development of a persistent, scalable, wide-area Arctic surveillance capability in both the air and maritime domains.  Advanced prototype efforts will leverage joint or Service partnerships and involve operational commands in the evaluation of field-ready prototypes in realistic military environments.  Additional new efforts will examine and find possible leverage points to improve the state of the art for rapid prototyping.  Potential efforts may include improved materials, reduced prototyping costs and\/or improved cycle times for prototyping activities."

It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training\/readiness, sustains DoD\u2019s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer."

Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high-priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  Technologies developed by SERDP enhance military operations, improve military systems\u2019 effectiveness, enhance military training\/readiness, sustain DoD\u2019s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and by reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer."

The account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capability.  These resources are a slim residual of much larger accounts supporting unique warfare capability analyses for joint customers including major combatant commander staffs and the Joint Staff.  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions.  Iterative military budget reductions to joint mission support programs significantly increased demand for JWP support from joint staffs and \u201cunits in the field\u201d assigned to joint missions. \n\nThe JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capability analysis and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps for identifying potential material solutions.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA), and the development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts.\n\nThe balance of JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  These early assessments of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of civilian operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis \u2013 IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support (JOS) division within OSD\u2019s AT&L organization, JOS works closely and continuously with joint customers around the world.  Analytic project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff."

These are resources dedicated to support joint capability analysis for joint customers and undertaken by Combatant Command staffs, and resources dedicated for independent analysis of joint warfare (currently conducted by the Institute for Defense Analysis \u2013 IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Iterative military budgets decrements leave JWP as the primary resource dedicated to analytic assessment of joint capability gaps and potential solutions.  During a period of force resetting and realignment, this resource becomes even more essential to staffs and military units dedicated to evolving joint missions.\n\nThe JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capability analysis and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps for identifying potential material solutions.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to projects in partnership with joint commands provide analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA), and the development of tools supporting joint commander analytic efforts.\n\nThe balance of JWP funds resource the Joint Warfare Independent Analysis segment, an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis \u2013 IDA).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support (JOS) division within OSD\/AT&L, JOS works closely and continuously with joint customers around the world.  Analytic project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff."

                            "val": "Software is key to meeting the DoD\u2019s increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution, and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net based products and systems has been increasing (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, DDG-1000, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code, \u201cIt is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.\u201d  The report notes that software is \u201c\u2026unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations\u2026\u201d and what we can accomplish is derived \u201c\u2026from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems\u2026.\u201d  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE\u2019s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of joint capabilities.\n\nSoftware is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  To address this, the P781 project within this PE funds research and development within the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and, to access particular expertise, in the Services, industry, and academia.\n\nThe SEI FFRDC is the DoD\u2019s dedicated source for software research and development.  It is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.  To ensure that the DoD retains a differential advantage over potential adversaries, funding at the SEI FFRDC will include a new Budget Activity 2 funding line beginning in FY 2014.  The reduction in P781 in this line beginning in FY 2014 is offset by the creation of the new line, the SEI Applied Research PE.  The creation of this new line represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE will also increase the collaboration opportunities for the SEI FFRDC with academia and attract top research talent to the SEI.  \n\nPrivate sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies, but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD unique needs, e.g., high assurance software or large-scale integrated systems.  The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies, to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs, and where appropriate, conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  The P783 project within this PE funds the Software Producibility Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative works across the Services, industry, and academia to research and transition software science and tools that address the capacity to design, produce, assure, and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk, cost, schedule, quality, and complexity."

The SEI maintains unique software research and program support capabilities in a space where the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and academia cannot as readily address challenges.  The mission of the SEI is to provide DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The Institute works across Government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools, and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community. It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice, and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management."

The Initiative maintains a portfolio of work relevant to the Warfighter and DoD needs by periodically evaluating technology development efforts, retiring those that are under performing, and starting new efforts based on risk-reward priority.  The Initiative demonstrates new underlying software technology and tools in various domains, e.g., Networks, Modeling and Simulation, Avionics, Signal Intelligence, where DoD can benefit and enhance the transition paths for the underlying technology."

These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF);  3) Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) Architecture and Integration (RAI) 4) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 5) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two year budget cycle.  These efforts field new capabilities at low cost in short time-frames, inform the traditional acquisition cycle, and inject innovative technology into programs of record.\n\nThe QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include: force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, undersea offensive capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the COCOMs.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes with new capabilities for demonstration and evaluation.\n \nThe Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology (S&T) base and those of the other federal departments, as well as academia and the commercial sector to identify emerging capabilities and counter evolving threats.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop cost saving prototype capabilities to counter emerging threats.  Additionally, RRTO works to leverage technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small, non-traditional businesses to address specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders, Military Service organizations, other Defense agencies and interagency organizations.  Typical RRF programs are 6-18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).      \n\nThe Architecture and Integration (RAI) program objectives are to enhance and expand rapid technology architecture and assessment capabilities in general; and, to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complex (JERC), Stiletto maritime test platform and the Thunderstorm Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series.  The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  RAI funding also supports Stiletto, a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm, an ongoing ISR exercise series, is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.  Due to the draw down in Afghanistan in FY 2014, projects in RAI are either being concluded or aligned to other QRSP programs  \n \nThe Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC\u2019s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts, in most instances, are conducted outside of the processes described in the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nThe Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) cell program objective is to support all COCOMs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational\/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command\u2019s senior leadership.  Each SMA cell effort is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the COCOM\u2019s senior leaders."

The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and addresses technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two year budget cycle.\n\nThe Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) Program provides the Services, Components, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on technologies that are at a relatively high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and to rapidly field-test promising new developmental and operational prototypes that can have immediate impact on military operations.  QRF initiatives are limited to those that will deliver a prototype application within twelve months of being funded.\n\nThe QRF Program also focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, catastrophic and irregular threats.  More specifically, initiatives that serve to maintain a technical advantage over potential adversaries and reduce technical risk barriers in the following interest areas: Anti-Access and Area Denial; Base Protection; Electromagnetic Bandwidth and Spectrum Enhancement; Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Newly Emerging National Threats; Directed Energy Capabilities; Low-Cost Precision Engagement Capabilities; Operational Field Demonstrations; Unmanned and Robotics Systems; Over the Horizon-Radar Technologies; and Counter-Electronic Warfare Technologies.  \n\nIn FY 2014 and FY 2015, the QRF Program will continue to identify and fund new projects and prototypes that respond to critical operational needs and new technology development.  Current and future efforts that show significant effectiveness can be leveraged by additional investments in order to accelerate transition to operational forces."

The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to mitigate emerging threats and address technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two-year budget cycle. \n\nThe Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  The RRTO was established to accelerate the transition of high-potential science and technology (S&T) projects into operationally useful prototypes in the execution years.  The RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T base and those of the other Federal Departments, academia, and industry; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of prototypical capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  With projects supporting each Combatant Command and with a global perspective, the RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and advanced commercial capabilities.  Prototypes delivered by RRTO provide cost effective capabilities to operational users faster than the typical acquisition cycle.\n\nIn prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance stimulation for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established an innovation outreach cell that is facilitating better interactions with small companies with emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.  \n\nIn FY 2014 and FY 2015, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations while working to support the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rapid Fielding goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRTO's potential focus areas for FY 2014 and FY 2015 projects include:  capabilities to operate in denied areas, navigation in Global Positioning System denied environments,  persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architecture; ISR sensors; global warming\u2019s impact on operations in the Arctic, novel power sources for unmanned vehicles, interface of law enforcement and military operations; commercial product vulnerabilities and applications; biometrics and forensics S&T; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination; cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; counter proliferation initiatives;  strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and, non-traditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.  \n\nThe typical length of a RRTO project falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively respond to the Warfighter."

Bluegrass data has been provided to more than 150 organizations to facilitate development of new Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  In FY 2013, RRTO collaborated with the intelligence community and subject matter experts to make final plans to execute the Bluegrass II data collect which will explore the applications of low cost, low-access sensing such as urban video networks and social media to augment or replace traditional ISR sensors.  These efforts inform and enable development of ISR capabilities needed for future military operations in denied or austere areas.  Specific Bluegrass II objectives include developing an algorithm to track an individual across a dense urban video network, developing a technique to discover threat communications in social media, and developing a methodology to discover and characterize all Red Team nodes."

The highlight of this Spiral was the capability to share information in near real-time among eight data nodes.  Spiral 13-2 built upon lessons learned from Spiral 13-1, placed emphasis on the maritime-to-land transition activity and the ability to prosecute suspicious actors as they quickly meld themselves into urban or rural populations.  This information was gathered and then shared in near real time to the data nodes.  In FY 2013, Thunderstorm spirals demonstrated 28 emerging capabilities in operationally realistic environments with a broad range of potential operational users providing support.\n\nIn the space arena, a classified project in partnership with the NRO successfully demonstrated the ability to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment for transferring large data files from theater to the U.S.  The project used a COTS SATCOM High Data Rate Modem to improve the bandwidth throughput by 100 percent.

The second component was a case analysis of the drivers of buffers to political, social, economic and environmental instability in the Dhaka, Bangladesh population center.  The third component of the study was an assessment and testing of novel ways to present and visualize megacity stability data.  This benefited COCOM planners with forecasting socio-cultural trends affecting state, regional, or community level stability.  Also, this effort answered the need for quantitative stability assessment approaches to address key national security considerations including the potential for resurgence of violent extremism; humanitarian crisis; reinforcement of outlier state behavior and consideration of partner and ally relations."

This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&E\/S&T Program performs the following activities:\n\u2022 Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&E) requirements.\n\u2022 Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&E community.\n\u2022 Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&E.\nAdditionally, the T&E\/S&T Program examines emerging T&E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&E technology needs and to develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other government agencies, industry, and academia to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  This program provides travel funds for T&E\/S&T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.\n  The DoD established seven strategic science and technology (S&T) investment priorities: 1) Data to Decisions, 2) Engineered Resilient Systems, 3) Cyber Science and Technology, 4) Electronic Warfare\/ Electronic Protection, 5) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction, 6) Autonomy, and 7) Human Systems.  The T&E\/S&T Program has been aligned and prioritized to prepare the T&E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from these S&T priority investments.\n  The T&E\/S&T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities."

Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  \n  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\n  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\n  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

Current production ground test facilities could only create the high temperature inlet conditions necessary for scramjet engine tests by burning fuel in the airflow prior to entering the engine.  As demonstrated by HSST FY 2011 tests, the resulting \u201cvitiated air\u201d had different gas properties than clean air and was not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affected the engine\u2019s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  Variable Mach number capability is required to \u201cfly the mission\u201d and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program, were initiated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, variable Mach number 5-8 aero propulsion test facility.  Completion of this facility will demonstrate component technologies have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year in Phase I of the facility development including the completed installation of the clean air regenerative storage heater, associated support systems, instrumentation and controls required for facility operation.  Design efforts for subsequent phases progressed including the critical design of the air delivery system and preliminary design of a variable Mach number nozzle.  Another FY2013 effort examined the incorporation of advanced morphing ceramic materials into the design of common facility nozzle and ducting hardware to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  This capability reached critical design and promises to provide a significant advantage over current rigid, stationary facility hardware by providing a \u201cfirst-ever\u201d realistic variable Mach flight distortion simulation test capability, while reducing test cost and increasing productivity.\n  Ground test accomplishments included continued progress in determining the capability of existing ground test facilities and methodologies to evaluate and develop large-scale hypersonic propulsion systems.  Following the successful completion of the benchmark freejet test series utilizing an advanced hydrocarbon fueled missile scale scramjet in a larger facility, the semi-freejet and direct-connect test configurations were initiated in a smaller facility. The resulting analysis comparing tests between the larger and smaller facilities will allow the optimized utilization of existing facilities.  In addition this effort will help define the size and type of investments needed for future large-scale scramjet vehicle development and reduction of flight test and acquisition risks.  The hypersonic community\u2019s first rigorous assessment of data uncertainty was completed on the freejet test series per the US National Standard on measurement uncertainty, which will serve as a precedent for future high-speed propulsion system development. Another task was initiated to examine the unique and extensive set of ground and flight test data collected by the X-51 program so that it can be utilized in the development of state-of-the-art techniques for high speed engine design, development and testing. The HSST project initiated an effort to address critical arc heater technologies and flow quality gaps; this development will improve the service lives of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  Improved computational and numerical simulation models were completed involving magnetic field and arc column interactions with the air flow in the heater necessary to investigate advanced designs and allow for time\/memory efficient parallel computing of the simulations.\n  The autonomous flight safety technology was matured to TRL 6 and prototype units were designed and delivered for service certification onboard two Operationally Responsive Space Office flight tests.  Another flight test technology effort completed the successful development and programing of advanced parameter identification maneuvers into the flight computer of the fourth X-51 flight.  Subsequent analysis of these optimized test maneuvers demonstrated the ability to collect substantially more stability and control data per flight than is possible using traditional methods, thus reducing the number of flight tests and costs for future development systems.\n  Progress was also made in advanced high speed system ground and flight test instrumentation.  The initial phase was completed on a ground based, portable Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed\/direction, O2 content) along a hypersonic vehicle\u2019s flight path from altitudes of 60k to 250k feet.  This initial phase demonstrated the ability to measure these conditions using the LIDAR system at the GroundWinds facility in Mauna Loa, Hawaii at altitudes representative of hypersonic vehicle flight trajectories. This capability will be a significant advancement over current technologies, improving the accuracy of determining atmospheric conditions at high altitudes needed for assessing the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development.  A project was initiated to develop a force balance system with high stiffness and frequency response to make measurements in hypervelocity flows with test times of 1-2 milliseconds.  This will substantially increase the accuracy of high Mach force measurements that are required to evaluate and improve models of air chemistry in design and prediction codes. An advanced system to measure gas properties in high speed flows was constructed utilizing lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum.  This system, which significantly lowers gas property measurement uncertainty, was transitioned to a DoD ground test center and a DoD research laboratory.  A miniaturized, temperature-compensated wind tunnel balance for supersonic store separation testing was constructed and transitioned.  Design, fabrication and demonstration of a non-intrusive laser hygrometer and a non-intrusive optical mass flow measurement system were completed.  Testing of a fiber optic heat flux gauge and a high temperature shear stress sensor were also successfully completed.\n  Advances were achieved in the development of a state-of-the-art validated computational M&S tools.  An advanced three-dimensional boundary layer transition code and hypersonic nozzle Characteristics Based Grid Generation code have been developed and transitioned to the hypersonic community for beta testing.  Recent wind tunnel and flight tests have provided data demonstrating that a fully three-dimensional flow boundary layer stability and transition prediction code is an essential engineering tool needed to evaluate and predict boundary layer instability and transition on maneuverable boost-glide vehicles currently under development by the DoD. Computed tomography methods for optical absorption measurements were completed; these create two-dimensional spatial maps of exhaust gas properties from multi-line-of-sight Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) measurements for verifying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code predictions and for determining combustion efficiency for turbine and scramjet engines.  This capability will greatly increase the diagnostic value of measurements from miniature, robust TDLAS gas diagnostic sensor systems now routinely used for engine ground and flight testing"

The project activities will include completion of the Phase 1 system checkouts and activation of the clean air regenerative storage heater technology.\n  Scramjet ground tests in semi-free jet, and direct connect test modes will be concluded and compared to free-jet test results to quantify their respective accuracies and identify optimal test methods for larger, next generation scramjet engines.

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to create test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or rugged packaging to survive airborne test applications.\n  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) effort, enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD\u2019s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band while opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry.\n  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

Development of a multi-band transceiver operating in the L\/S\/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms continued.  \n  The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in multiple range environments, specifically regarding missile test missions.  Additionally, the SET project continued efforts to develop the required hardware components (antenna, transmitter) required to conduct a missile test mission.  Testing of this hardware began to characterize the telemetry link performance of the C-Band spectrum versus the legacy S-Band spectrum. SET continued efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology to enable flexible scheduling of the T&E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional L\/S bands and recently permitted C-Band frequencies.  Some of these technologies will reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test large-footprint weapons, such as long range missiles.\n  The SET project completed the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.  This tool provides higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain, environmental, and various other factors on telemetry channels.

Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the airspace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense.  Additionally, a new generation of enemy radio frequency (RF) missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The test and evaluation (T&E) community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.\n  The technology development efforts within the EWT project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the electro-optic (EO), including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems, reconnaissance sensors, and missile seeker subsystems.\n  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw for instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted soldiers, must not adversely affect soldier performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.

Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2013 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI for warfighter systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded environments, such as in urban canyons and tunnels.  Efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment included technology that employs a layered system of sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency (RF) ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise TSPI under GPS-impaired conditions.  Preliminary testing in a realistic environment was successfully conducted in both open-air and RF-challenged environments achieving sub-meter tracking accuracies.  An inertial tracking system for dismounted warfighters continued in development; the system employs boot-mounted sensors to provide sub-meter geolocation over GPS-denied durations of greater than 2 hours.  System integration and performance testing were conducted; design improvements are ongoing.\n  To support testing of high-speed, high-acceleration systems, an ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver was developed.  The receiver performs significantly better than existing test instrumentation.  The AIST project gathered requirements for future test and evaluation GPS dependent TSPI activities, conducted analyses and mapped a way forward with respect to the development of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design architectures for next generation solutions.\n  In support of other instrumentation solutions, an electro-releasable attachment technology development effort continued.  This included investigation of new adhesive formulations that employ an electrically releasing foil patch to allow attachment of sensors to non-conductive, painted exterior surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles.  The goal is to provide immediate attachment for a test and significantly reduce the time to restore the system under test to its operational configuration.  \n  To support Electromagnetic Rail Gun (EMRG) developments, AIST continued development of a fiber-optic instrumentation suite to integrate into test projectiles to measure magnetic field strength in the harsh environment of an EMRG test firing.  Powered air gun testing was successfully conducted at 50,000G levels at the Army Research Lab\u2019s Adelphi site.  Preparations are underway to support full-up testing of an EMRG shot at the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Dahlgren Division.  \n  The AIST project developed algorithms and methods for automated detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors (e.g., hydrophones) to improve testing at DoD undersea range complexes.  Testing has been successfully conducted at undersea ranges and a baseline classifier for 6 marine mammal species is currently running real-time, range-wide at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Pacific Range Missile Facility, and the Southern California Offshore Range.  This test technology allows the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&E) events without adversely impacting marine mammal populations, and to support the Navy\u2019s Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring Program (ICMP) ensuring adherence to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).\n  Several efforts were initiated to develop technologies to:  (1) measure position and attitude (six degrees of freedom) of high-velocity, spinning projectiles at accuracies that significantly exceed the system under test guidance system; (2) measure soldier\/soldier system indoor location (GPS-denied environment) at sub-meter accuracies using ambient AM radio broadcast signals; (3) provide seamless transition between outdoor and indoor environments to accurately track systems under test using modified GPS receivers, relayed GPS signals, and multi-lateration and multipath mitigation techniques; (4) use passive imaging to characterize munitions\/warhead fragment size, velocity, and distribution, and significantly reduce set-up times and data analysis costs of current warhead arena test techniques; (5) accurately provide dynamic measurements and display the warfighter body posture, head and weapon orientation using fiber optic shape sensing of fibers integrated into uniforms and equipment; and (6) assess warfighter cognitive states using algorithms and measurements of brain electrical activity and brain blood oxygen levels. \n  An effort was initiated to investigate mitigation of the impacts of wind energy system interference on test range radars.  \n  Efforts continued to assess and leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and government laboratories.  These efforts will provide significant advances to T&E of modern war fighting systems."

A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.\n  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats."

Additionally, the NST project develops technologies to analyze and evaluate the increasingly massive amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by complex net-centric tests.  The technology to conduct T&E on net-centric systems is challenged by sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide an accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking and situational awareness), as the data passes among different systems of Service and coalition participants.  The NST technologies advance test automation (test planning, test execution, test control, and analysis) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using models and simulations along with hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and Command and Control systems accessing and providing information to the Global Information Grid.  The technology development efforts within the NST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in measuring \u201cData to Decision\u201d techniques and warfighting capabilities.  Ultimately, the NST portfolio enables the T&E community to \u201ctest like we fight\u201d by replicating net-enabled, Joint mission operations within a T&E environment."

Technology development to automate the processes that analyze and evaluate multiple SoS in a joint cross-Service mission context were also initiated. Other efforts included technology development for planning a complex, multi-system, mission-level net-centric test in a distributed live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environment and controlling test execution through management of the mission scenario.  The NST project developed test planning technologies to address test integration and interoperability issues.  Machine reasoning capabilities were extended and integrated to automate test planning tasks.  The NST project continued development of a planning and visualization technology to support joint mission thread testing to better correlate test data to the effectiveness of mission operations.\n  The NST project advanced technologies to support the execution of distributed tests with active network control, enhanced the dynamic management of the test infrastructure, and improved the integration of Service laboratories and test ranges.  These technologies were transitioned and integrated into the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) that was used by the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) Program and at test facilities and training ranges.  \n  The NST project developed predictive smart dead-reckoning technology to address the challenge to adequately synchronize the distributed test environment.  This effort provided the necessary distributed intelligence to manage time space position information (TSPI) updates in the net-centric test battlespace with a distributed LVC architecture.  The NST project built upon previously developed NST technologies to solve the test challenges of producing accurate TSPI predictions under all network conditions, to include both unpredictable network latency and missing information.  Since the predictive smart dead-reckoning technology is built on top of the policy-enabled agent, it will be able to provide fast response under complex test event conditions.  The CTEIP Joint Distributed Infrared Countermeasures Ground-Testing System (JDIGS) project tested and validated this NST project to further improve the error performance for JDIGS testing over the JMETC network.  \n  The NST project also developed technologies for the next generation of TENA middleware that supported a broad range of networks, including wireless networks, and provided native support for handheld and embedded computing platforms.  Global Positioning System and accelerometer test data were successfully transmitted over commercial cellular carriers using an encrypted virtual private network.  The NST project transitioned technology to the Edwards Air Force Base Instrumentation Group by successfully demonstrating TENA connectivity through wireless networks providing a live or file replay of flight line instrumentation data on wireless tablet devices with real-time synchronization."

They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology development efforts within the UAST project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess autonomous systems\u2019 ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.\n  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems."

The complexity of operational unmanned and autonomous systems, with all possible interactions occurring between sensing, perception, reasoning, mapping, decision making and action, resulted in an almost infinite set of potential interactions and correspondingly, an almost infinite set of test conditions.  An effort was initiated to employ evolutionary\/genetic algorithms in a software-in-the-loop environment to accurately predict the fault conditions of a complex, long-duration autonomous system.  Initially supporting testing of the Large Displacement \u2013 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, this test technology was extended to improve the ability to predict fault conditions and focus test strategies for other types of unmanned vehicles. The UAST project effort initiated work to enhance safety of autonomous system testing to prevent unsafe UAS operations\/actions. Additionally, work began to develop methods to measure autonomous system reliability and performance by providing complex and interactive live, virtual, constructive (LVC) test environments to stimulate UASs so their response and performance can be observed, recorded, and compared to pre-test simulations.\n  In the area of autonomous system performance assessment, test technology development continued to enable automated autonomy architecture stress testing, with a focus on UAS software and the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code.  The approach was agnostic to the specific component interface.  This technology provided the tester with a perspective of system performance and a previously unavailable prediction of behavior.  Recent stress-testing of a representative ground-based UAS system identified vulnerability issues at the command interface layer of the system.  Additionally, in the area of autonomous system performance assessment, a virtual UAS proving ground was designed that used environmental data from external sources (to include imagery from operational areas of interest) and injected that data into simulations of a given UAS to predict the behavior of the system in the operational environment.  An initial demonstration of this test technology facilitated efficient testing in operationally representative environments at Savannah River Test Site and Aberdeen Test Center and allowed for safe operations at \u201cedge of the envelope\u201d performance parameters."

Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will need advancement and maturation of various nascent test technologies.  The CTT project has been aligned with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) priorities, specifically in the area of Cyber S&T.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats, and executing cyberspace tests."

It contains two projects.\n\nP455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes science and technology to promote long term change in the Department's capabilities to be better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy. It generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance. This mission has two key aspects.  First, to develop and\/or demonstrate, and rapidly transition into, use operational energy technologies or practices that will improve the Department\u2019s military capabilities and\/or reduce its costs. Second, to establish within the military Services sustainable, institutional capacity to continue to research, develop and adopt operational energy innovations. OECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to consolidate or start promising operational energy programs, directions or changes to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.\n\nP456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module, co-sponsored by ASD(R&E) and ASD(OEPP), develops advanced technology in energy storage to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of this program are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power and energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (2) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E). AMPED technology will be used to potentially extend the operational performance benefits and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configurations."

The Navy\/ARPA-E cooling technology program completed feasibility studies of two competing prototypes to efficiently remove humidity from the air before cooling.  It also began three other projects based on innovative cooling technologies. The Army\/Air Force soft shelters\/tent program completed design of selected shelter configurations; conducted field demos of shelter systems in Kuwait which showed a 50 percent energy savings; and worked on advanced component technologies to be used in future designs. The super energy efficient Containerized Living Unit (SuperCLU) program built a Phase 1 prototype SuperCLU and continued improving the design. They completed testing improved CLUs and the prototype SuperCLUs at 29 Palms, CA, and existing CLU ECUs and coatings in Camp Lemonnier, Africa. The PACOM\/DOE program that tests load reduction technologies in tropical environments participated in operations in Thailand and Philippines, gathering energy usage data. They also developed and promoted their I-Net technology assessment capability and completed 2-dozen technology assessments. The Waste-to-Energy program completed syngas-cleaning prototype fabrication which is now being tested.  The program also completed rotary kiln hardware assembly and fabrication of the first prototype Shredded Waste Gasifier.\n\nThe new programs, started in FY 2013, are broad, comprehensive efforts to improve DoD\u2019s operational energy performance, particularly by involving non-traditional innovators and small businesses in meeting DoD\u2019s operational energy challenges through mechanisms such as consortia. These four new programs focus on: developing DoD standards for tactical microgrids; tools and training for more efficient planning and control of the energy resources at expeditionary outposts; technologies and systems engineering techniques to better manage soldier and small unit power and reduce their battery burden; and reducing aircraft fuel consumption by reducing drag through engineered surfaces and materials."

The Army\/Navy cooling technology program will complete ECU system design; construct, test and demo a prototype for Technology Enabled Capability Demonstration (TeCD); continue research on integrated power and environmental control technologies. The Navy\/ARPA-E cooling technologies program will complete developments for a transition demo at TRL 6 in FY 2015. The Army\/Air Force soft shelter tent program will complete initial demonstrations and validate mathematical models and simulations. The Navy Containerized Living Unit program will complete testing both advanced and upgraded CLUs.  The PACOM\/DOE program will continue lab and field assessment of promising technologies, probably in Guam, and continue to seek fee for service partners for long term sustainment of the program, while nurturing relationships with existing partners. For the Waste-to-Energy program, detailed designs for new devices will be prepared and operational tests will be performed.\n\nRegarding the consortia programs begun in FY 2013: The Army led program in tactical microgrid standards will focus on identifying gaps in standards, policy, and practices that pose obstacles for system implementation. These gaps will be categorized into a development agenda for the project. The need for standards for small, medium, and large forward operating bases will be documented and the similarities and differences identified.  The Navy led program for energy efficient expeditionary outposts will begin verifying models and defining dashboard requirements. The Army led soldier\/small unit program will establish a consortium that will formulate a next-generation Soldier\/Small Combat Unit Power and Energy architecture for the future. The program will also develop a return on investment tool to enable traditional defense contractors, non-traditionals, and small businesses to evaluate the ROI for their innovative soldier power and energy concepts. The Air Force drag reduction program will form a consortium; issue RFPs, and award studies for drag reduction technologies. \n\nFY 2014 new starts will focus on filling operational energy technology gaps identified in a technology gap assessment effort completed by ASD(R&E) in FY 2012. For FY 2014, the planned focus is methods and tools, including modeling and simulation, to embed energy considerations throughout DoD's planning processes, before engineering particular systems or platforms. This will facilitate making operational energy a consideration during such processes as war-games, force planning, requirements development and acquisition planning. With better methods and tools for understanding the burdens and vulnerabilities imposed by operational energy needs and how those needs affect our military effectiveness, planners and decision makers will be able to make choices that are better informed by operational energy considerations."

The Navy\/ ARPA-E program for cooling technologies will complete testing and optimization of the Absorption Heat Pump, Genset Heat Recovery Adsorption Chiller, and Stirling Air Conditioner prototypes, and hold TRL 6 transition demonstrations. The PACOM\/DOE testbed plans to complete the transition to a fee-for-service model for long-term viability.\n\nRegarding the consortia programs: The Army-led program in tactical microgrid standards will prepare draft standards for tactical microgrids that will include (a) interconnection and islanding, (b) communication and controls, and (c) safety, protection and human factors. The Navy led program for planning and operating energy efficient expeditionary outposts will refine power models based on testing and feedback and will implement an alpha version of the dashboard for testing and feedback for extended development. The Army-led soldier\/small unit program will use the Architecture developed in FY 2014 to develop technologies to demonstrate electrical load reduction, improved energy supply, and power management and distribution techniques.  These will reduce the operational, fiscal, and human burdens imposed by batteries\/energy technologies. The Air Force drag reduction program will hold a second workshop to review progress and to choose awardees for a second round of research awards. Lab, wind tunnel, and flight testing of surfaces and coating technologies will occur throughout the year as needed. In addition, the FY2014 new starts will be ramping up.  These programs will be aimed at developing methods and tools, including modeling and simulation, to embed operattional energy considerations throughout DoD\u2019s planning processes.\n\nGenerally, FY 2015 new starts will be focused on filling one or more of the operational energy technology gaps identified in a technology gap assessment  completed by ASD(R&E) or other significant gaps OEPP identifies in Service S&T funding.  Consistent with the mission of this funding , these programs will aim to fill some of the gaps by funding the startup of sustainable S&T programs within the Services. The five top priority gaps are: High Efficiency Energy Conversion and Harvesting; Energy Integrated Design and Simulation; High Efficiency Propulsion and Platform Design; Environmental Control Systems; Flexible and Adaptive Power Distribution."

The goals of this program are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power and energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (2) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E). AMPED technology will be used to potentially extend the operational performance benefits and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configurations."

Further effort established system level metrics for HESM demonstrations and concept of operations in all demonstration areas. Efforts associated with Army and USMC battlefield generator and vehicle HESM demonstrator development were continued. Key new initiatives in FY 2013 were initiated for Air Force and Navy aircraft, and Navy ships HESM demonstrator development. Further energy storage technology demonstration effort associated with safe operation of energy storage impacting all three military application areas was initiated. The goal of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a safe energy storage structure which is capable of not only buffering against life-reducing high operating temperatures due to aggressive cycling operations but also preventing or limiting thermal runaway conditions.

The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) \u2013 nuclear, biological and chemical threats \u2013 mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD \u2013 it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\" January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant\narrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),\ndevelopment (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\" January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record \u2013 which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant\narrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied),\ndevelopment (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.\n\nNuclear Terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based Prompt Diagnostic sensors and Particulate Airborne Collection Systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of Nuclear Forensics. \n\nPer DoDI 2060.04 OSD AT&L NCB is the program lead for the Department of Defense in Nuclear Forensics.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but focuses heavily on post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post detonation Nuclear Forensics capability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program."

Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 166 evaluations in 36 countries, including Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.  The program\u2019s technologies have cleared 23 million sq meters of the world\u2019s toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 109,000 mines and UXO\n\nUnder the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO\/LIC), the HD R&D Program works closely with the COCOMS and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter by developing and implementing mine\/UXO detection and clearance technologies; speeding improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reducing the threat to host nation population and US forces; reducing insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhancing mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries. \n \nAreas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO\/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DoS), U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and mine-affected nations.  \n\nThe program element\u2019s work is consistent with the Department of Defense\u2019s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with \u00a7 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines, unexploded ordnance and small arms ammunition."

The HD R&D Program focuses on development of new technologies to improve the efficiency and safety of indigenous nation-conducted, post-conflict clearance of residual mines and UXO, which pose a serious threat to US forces conducting stability operations, and to the host nation\u2019s population and economy.  \n\nEvaluations of HD R&D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for US military countermine R&D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to world-wide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 163 evaluations in 36 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program\u2019s technologies have cleared 21+ million sq meters of the world\u2019s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 101,000+ mines and UXO; and provided 306,000 mine\/UXO disposal charges with 36 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.\n\nUnder the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO\/LIC), the HD R&D Program works closely with the COCOMS and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter by developing and implementing mine\/UXO detection and clearance technologies; speeding improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reducing the threat to host nation population and US forces; reducing insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhancing mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries. \n \nAreas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO\/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DoS), U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and mine-affected nations.  \n\nThe program element\u2019s work is consistent with the Department of Defense\u2019s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with \u00a7 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines, unexploded ordnance and small arms ammunition."

Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance by supporting DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission. CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent\u2019s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds up the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  In its thirteen-year history, CWP has leveraged $4 of foreign partner funding for every $1 of U.S. Government investment, and $3 of other U.S. Government funding for every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects. \n\nCWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners."

Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance by supporting DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission. CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent\u2019s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds up the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  In its thirteen-year history, CWP has leveraged $4 of foreign partner funding for every $1 of U.S. Government investment, and $3 of other U.S. Government funding for every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects. \n\nCWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners."

                            "val": "(U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 \"Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure\" of 01 February 2010.\n \n(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as a collaboration between universities, academies and research laboratories, focused on corrosion technology research and development to provide solutions to long-term, complex corrosion prevention and control problems, including metallic-non-metallic interactions, advanced surface coatings and treatments for non-traditional use of materials . This advanced corrosion research has been funded since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.\n\nIn FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.\n\n(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given technology development, demonstration, and transition project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&L) for final approval.  Likewise, members of the TCC are notified of advanced research requirements and provided instructions for submitting white papers and subsequent project proposals to the Science and Technology Working Integrated Product Team (WIPT) for evaluation, selection and funding.\n\n(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: \"Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . .\"  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.\n \nThese projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2014 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance."

These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.\n \n(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&L) for final approval.\n\n(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: \"Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . .\"  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.\n \nThese projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2014 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance."

Implementation plan:  Explanation of how the project will be implemented when completed including a description of the transition approach, and plans to evaluate ROI during the first two years of implementation.   \n   \nThe Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) receives project plans and engages an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, and joint service applicability.  DEA efficiency scores are provided to the evaluation team to assist in their prioritization of projects for funding.  In addition, evaluators consider the following in recommending final priorities:\n1. Return on investment credibility: Degree to which there is evidence that the project will achieve an acceptable return on investment\n2. Technology maturity:  Degree to which proposed technology has been developed or demonstrated and will satisfy project objectives \n3. Schedule confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed on time\n4. Budget confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed within the proposed budget\n5. Management support: Degree to which management actively supports this project and has committed program resources to both manage and support this project\nThe project priority ranking is finalized and sent to the CPCIPT lead for a final decision..  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects by the CPCIPT, the projects are briefed to the Corrosion Forum.  Funding is distributed between the Services based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.     \n   \nUpon selection by CPCIPT of the highest priority projects and final funding approval, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) transfers individual project funding to the appropriate funding sites that are provided by the Services.  After receiving the project funding, the Services are responsible for the funding and management of the projects.  OSD retains oversight and direction of the Corrosion Prevention and Control initiative through the CPCIPT.  Project oversight includes the review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   \n   \nThe quarterly project report (PR) format has been defined and requires the following input:   \n1. Statement of progress \n2. Outstanding issues \n3. Performance goals and metrics \n4. Upcoming events\n5. Schedule status \n6. Current return on investment (ROI) status \nThese project reports (PRs) are submitted to the CPCIPT.  The CPCIPT analyzes project status, progress and project statistics and informs the Service points of contact (POCs) of any project problems.  Projects are also required to report verbally at Corrosion Forums, as appropriate.   \n\nIn addition to the project plans described above, advanced research white papers and subsequent proposals are solicited from universities, academies and research laboratories that constitute the TCC.  The proposed efforts must include collaboration between two or more members of the TCC and address significant corrosion problems that call for ground-breaking science and technology and\/or complex research and development in the five areas corrosion program areas cited above. Not only does the TCC produce technologies, advanced components, and products that reduce the impact of corrosion on DoD weapons systems and infrastructure and increase their sustainability; but it also provides participants with advanced education and skills to form the core of the future corrosion prevention and control technical community, its support network, and its suppliers.   \n\nCorrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) Program direction, control and oversight include the following activities to be performed by staff and support contractors:   \n1. Plan and schedule Corrosion Forums and oversee Corrosion Forum activities and working Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings.   \n2. Oversee project performance including review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   \n3.

Cost-effective land-based defense will be demonstrated by closing the fire control loop between existing sensors and prototype ground-launched Railgun projectiles. To facilitate this, LBRG will integrate the Railgun launcher, power, projectile, and sensor so that projectiles may be command guided during a series of flight tests. These tests will verify performance and lethality results from modeling and simulation. Testing will conclude by demonstrating projectile fly-out and control, sensor tracking of projectiles, communication from sensor to projectile, integrated guidance, navigation and control, culminating in an FY2015 live-fire, closed-loop, command-guided launch from a 20 mega-joule Railgun.\n\nThis is a new PE for FY 2014 that contains OSD land-based Railgun investments to accelerate fire control loop closure. In FY 2011 and FY 2012, ramp investments were provided from alternate RDT&E PEs to enable the following accomplishments:\n\u2022 Initiated development of high fidelity models and simulations for gun launched guided projectile engagements.\n\u2022 Anchored projectile models with wind tunnel and flight test data in collaboration with the Navy\u2019s Office of Naval Research (ONR).\n\u2022 Analyzed several effective sensor architectures using existing sensors to support gun launched guided projectile engagements.\n\u2022 Selected sensors to support FY 2014 flight tests of prototype projectile airframes.\n\u2022 Conducted several projectile airframe flight tests in the first quarter\u2014a quarter ahead of schedule\u2014in collaboration with ONR.\n\u2022 Installed tracker hardware and successfully tracked a projectile flight with tactically relevant measurement accuracies in the first quarter in collaboration with ONR and the Army\u2019s Armament Research Development and Engineering Center."

The display work included Display Usability Tests conducted with UAS operators in Huntsville, AL and at Ft Huachuca, AZ to refine the Alert & Traffic Display subsystem. In addition to the usability tests, a Common Display Quick Study utilizing 15 Army participants \u2013 including manned pilots, unmanned operators and air traffic control personnel - was conducted with a focus on intruder prioritization schemes for a common display. Army's top level GBSAA requirements and a high-level description of its approval process were submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide a framework for a written agreement between DoD\/Army and the FAA on full integrated GBSAA operations, starting with Ft Hood, TX. Army GBSAA is considered a \u201cpathfinder\u201d for SAA system certification by the FAA. Army GBSAA Block 0 system requirements are base-lined and the development of software certification is underway with integration testing scheduled to begin in July 2014. Cherry Point MCAS began flying segregated transit GBSAA operations under a Certificate of Authorization (COA) in June 2013.

The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0604670D8Z will create transition ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and\/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices\/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels."

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\u201d January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as \u201cProtecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,\u201d January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  \n\nUnder this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial\/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  \n\nThis PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant\narrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), \ndevelopment (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives of the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  In FY 2015, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives of the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  In FY 2014 and FY 2015, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives of the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.  This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight test events and DoD budgets.  In FY 2015, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. The Common Joint Tactical Information funding line responds to the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities and for communications which meet net-centric standards to ensure interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems. It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms, Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways, Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations.They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and best value technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation."

Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. The Common Joint Tactical Information funding line responds to the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities and for communications which meet net-centric standards to ensure interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems. It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms, Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways, Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations. They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and best value technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation."

Incorporation of defense exportability features in initial designs can help control costs throughout the product life cycle.  \n\nFunding is increased in FY15 to expand the number of systems included in the Defense Exportability Pilot Program that are used to define and implement DEF \u2018best practice\u2019 program management, system engineering, and program protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.  Early development of export variants including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper (AT) protection and differential capability (DC) requirements to lower production costs, increase quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and enhance US industry share of the global marketplace."

As with the FY 2013 programs, FY 2014 feasibility studies will define the required actions for implementing DEF and assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&L) will engage with program offices through the Military Departments, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure offices to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A systems, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Technology Development Strategy and the Program Protection Plan (PPP).  For the systems that are in the pre-MS B development stage, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Acquisition Strategy and the PPP.  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies are executed.  Depending on the maturity of each program and where it is in the acquisition life cycle, the feasibility studies may be addressed in the Requests for Proposals (RFPs).      \n\nOUSD (AT&L) will conduct a follow-up industry round-table meeting to discuss the DEF concept, capture government and industry perspectives, and to identify further corresponding government and industry strategic choices. Government and industry participants will also identify mutual risks and challenges in implementing defense exportability features, and identify legislative, regulatory, or policy change proposals.  This will take place in the spring of 2014.\n\nOUSD (AT&L) will continue to develop recommended procedures and guidance to be incorporated in the DAG regarding incorporating DE business case analyses into contract and acquisition strategies, as well as procedures to cost share DEF implementation with industry and recoupment of these costs though foreign sales.  OUSD (AT&L) will also develop policies and processes to identify additional DoD funding sources for the next phases of DEF activities, as well as cost-sharing with contractors for the initial and follow-on research and development costs of DEF pilot programs, in accordance with Section 252 of the NDAA for FY 2012."

It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD\u2019s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nToday, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) uses various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), PBD Wizard, Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to keep than they need to be.\n\nThere is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller\u2019s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  \n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress."

The CMS Program increase is to expand the pilot program to close out services for cost-type contracts, and a portion is to be used to sustain existing AbilityOne closeout support teams. This funding plus up is not related to the Defense Electronic Procurement dollars however the funds were placed here because AT&L\/DPAP does not own another RDT&E PE."

The system measures readiness of the Department's components to execute the full range of missions assigned by the Secretary of Defense. \n\nThe Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for DoD.  DRRS measures the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense.  The realization of DRRS required integrating a host of key technologies to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The primary technical goal was the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems.  DRRS contains readiness metrics and supporting data for forces and support organizations."

Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoDs overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The QDR also lays out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning,  programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused  goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This  program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements."

This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department\u2019s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades\u2014a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.   To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements."

The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).\nJIM projects address critically needed T&E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; threat simulators; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for manned and unmanned aerial platforms and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure and electronic warfare systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.\nCTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.\nAnalyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide processes for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.\n\nThe REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.\nThis Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements."

The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).\n\n    The JIM funds critically needed T&E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, miniaturized flight safety systems, realistic urban test environments, ground testing for hypersonic systems and satellites, and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.\n\n   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.\n\n   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.\nThe REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.\n\n   This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements."

hostile fire munitions (e.g., small arms and RPG) firings to support evaluation of the Joint Allied Threat Awareness System. \n-  Complete the Automated Test Case Generator Web Service (ATC-GEN WS) to provide JITC with the capability to develop BMDS and Mode 5 IFF MIL-STD-6016E compliance test cases and an automated test tool on a test network.  \n-  Initiate development of instrumented facilities to evaluate our next generation of sensors, weapons, platforms, and C4ISR systems in a realistic urban environment.\n-  Initiate development of hardware simulators to test missile warning systems of new generation electronic warfare (EW) suites in a dynamic environment.\n-  Initiate the development of non-intrusive instrumentation to address near term OT capability shortfalls to evaluate advanced sensor system performance in harsh environments."

The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD\u2019s \u201cTesting in a Joint Environment Roadmap\u201d to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to \u201ctest like we fight.\u201d  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability; supporting system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service\/Component acquisition programs.  USD (AT&L) directed TRMC to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR) beginning October 1, 2012. The Director of TRMC assigned NCR to JMETC.  The JMETC program is funded within the RDT&E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs.  JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  To support the DoD guidance on cyber defense and attack operations, the JMETC environment includes a distributed cyberspace interoperability testing capability for systems under test.  JMETC is a widely applicable, persistent, service provider for the Department\u2019s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks, standardized data transport solutions, tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations, DoD corporate distributed testing expertise, and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability, through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC), streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn, this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.\n \n       By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.\n \n       JMETC\u2019s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  It also funds JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements to include distributed cyber testing); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.\n       \nThe Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department\u2019s lead for the JMETC program and oversees both its development and its operations."

                                            "val": "The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department\u2019s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201cTesting in a Joint Environment Roadmap\u201d to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to \u201ctest like we fight.\u201d  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability; supporting system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service\/Component acquisition programs.  Under Secretary Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) directed Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR) beginning October 1, 2012. The Director of TRMC assigned NCR to JMETC.  The JMETC program is funded within the RDT&E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs. \n   JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  JMETC is a widely applicable, persistent, service provider for the Department\u2019s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks, standardized data transport solutions, tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations, Department of Defense (DoD) corporate distributed testing expertise, and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability, through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC), streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn, this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.\n\n   By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.\n\n    JMETC\u2019s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  Additionally, in FY 2013 funding was added to the JMETC program to provide improved cyber test capability.  Also, in FY 2013, responsibility for the National Cyber Range (NCR) was given to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) and subsequently put under the JMETC management team.  The NCR was funded in FY 2013 through funds provided by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research & Engineering)(ASD(R&E)) reprogramming, and the TRMC investment programs.  JMETC program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.\n\t\n   The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department\u2019s lead for the JMETC program, the National Cyber Range, and oversees both their development and operations."

The design and development for this project has been completed and initial, early testing of the device with various waveforms has shown that this project will achieve it designed goals.  This capability will result in a significance cost avoidance (estimated in the millions of dollars) to the JTNC program.\n\n- Assisted and supported customers with distributed test tools and expertise for planning and executing their distributed events.\n\n- National Cyber Range:\n\n- Received responsibility for the National Cyber Range in Orlando, FL, a cyber test facility, a majority of which is a fully accredited Secure Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF).   The facility is comprised of an array of servers, networking, storage devices and an integrated tool suite.  During the year, the NCR was accredited by the Defense Intelligence Agency to operate at the Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence level of security, making the NCR fully test capable through the range of classification levels.  The NCR provides the ability to rapidly design, deploy and sanitize large scale, high fidelity test and training environments in which extremely malicious threats can be unleashed on operationally, representative systems and networks to assess the impact on the network, networked weapon systems, and the associated mission.   Considerable technological advancements were incorporated into the integrated tool suite which is highlighted by the significant level of automation and the ability to support up to four concurrent events, executed in completely isolated testbeds, at different levels of classification.\n\n- The NCR supported users in FY 2013 included Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, US Pacific Command, US Cyber Command, other Defense Agencies, and DoD development programs.  Their objectives have included testing for vulnerabilities, scalability, malware propagation, and effective defenses.  Even though the primary focus has been on functionalizing, refining and accrediting the capabilities, the NCR conducted 8 events through August of FY 2013, has another 8 events scheduled into FY 2014, and is planning additional tests to be executed after the end of the calendar year.  An event normally consists of a week for integration and set-up, a week or two of testing, and a week for analysis.\n\n- Cyber Test and Evaluation\n\n- Initiated the Cyber Range Interoperability Standards (CRIS) effort, developing a common lexicon, developing a standard cyber test process, and beginning the effort to prioritize needed standards which will result in efficiencies through improved interoperability and scalability.  This effort was executed through participation by representatives from across the cyber range community.\n\n- Worked with the Deputy Assistant Secretary Defense Developmental Test & Evaluation (DASD DT&E), Army Threat Systems Management Office, and the Air Force 46th Test Squadron to conduct an Integrated Cyber Event (ICE).  This cyber test event proved that the infrastructure is adequate to test a command and control system.  However, it also pointed out the significant need for improvements in areas such as red and blue environments, cyber test instrumentation, and a cyber visualization capability.\n\n- Deployed the first of several production Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDP).  This first system resides at the Threat System Management Office (TSMO) and will provide enterprise resources for computing, storage, and common services.  Funded the development of the second Regional Service Delivery Point (RSDP) which will provide increased capacity for cyber test and training.   The RSDPs will also promote efficiencies by providing enterprise services, such as realistic traffic generation, visualization tools, instrumentation, and other tools.\n\n- Developed Cyber T&E Use Cases, a set of operational and system architecture driven products, that helps identify potential threat vectors and test concepts needed to identify Cyber T&E infrastructure requirements for testing representative C2 Systems, Combat Systems, Weapon Systems, and Business IT Systems.\n\n- Initiated planning for significant distributed test infrastructure enhancements that will support multiple, concurrent classification up to and including TS\/\/SCI with a focus on leveraging the RSDP capabilities and incorporating both kinetic and non-kinetic assets to address growing interoperability and cyber T&E requirements."

Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the strategic redeployment of forces in the face of technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.\n\nIn FY 2014 the budget request for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) program will be transferred to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.  TSCMIS is an existing program that will be executed by the Joint Staff separately from the Technical Studies, Support, and Analysis program. The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems program responds to OSD's Guidance for Employment of the Force so that Combatant Commanders, Military Department Chiefs, CSA Directors, and applicable Defense Agency and Field Activity Directors are able to use a tracking mechanism to account for their steady-state activities that is accessible to other DoD components. Together these tracking mechanisms will provide a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components. The intent of this program is to encourage further development of tracking mechanisms in order to achieve full visibility of Defense Department activities."

Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the strategic redeployment of forces in the face of technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.\n\nFrom FY 2010 through FY 2013 this program element included funding for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) Program, which is a separate program from the OSD Technical Studies, Support & Analysis program.  TSCMIS is an existing program which provides a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components and enables that information to be accessible by other DoD components.  Proposed enhancements to TSCMIS will enable all of the Services and Combatant Commands to access information in this system and will allow the incorporation of data provided by other interagency partners.    The budget request for the TSCMIS program was transferred to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency beginning in FY 2014."

The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.\n\nSpecific activities include:\n- Develop and publish in electronic form (including Internet version) restricted editions of the MCTL document that describe the military and proliferation significance of various technologies.\n- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.\n- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.\n- Limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.\n- Identification and determination of technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.\n- Identification of foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.\n\n(2) The DoD Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) Program:\nThe Defense Industrial Base (DIB) secures critical DoD programs and technology by protecting DoD unclassified information resident on and transiting DIB unclassified networks.  This project further establishes the DoD DAMO to coordinate the conduct of assessments involving the loss of DoD information requiring controls resulting from the unauthorized access and\/or exfiltration of technical data maintained on unclassified DIB networks.  The DAMO identifies and categorizes the impact of the loss of acquisition information contained on the affected systems, organizes, and coordinates the assessment reports with all affected components and DIB members, and establishes a process to appropriately share collected information with all affected parties.  The DAMO establishes policy and procedures for conducting damage assessments applicable to all DoD components and in concert with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) procedures pertaining to contracts with the DIB.\n\nSpecific activities include:\n- Provide technical expertise and analyses in assessing the impact of data lost as a result of the unauthorized access and\/or exfiltration. \n- Develop a damage assessment ontology and data repository in order to provide analysis to identify trends in the targeting and compromise of defense program information."

The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.\n\nSpecific activities include:\n- Develop and publish in electronic form (including Internet version) restricted editions of the MCTL document that describe the military and proliferation significance of various technologies.\n- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.\n- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.\n- Limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.\n- Identification and determination of technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.\n- Identification of foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.\n\n(2) The DoD Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) Program:  \nThe Defense Industrial Base (DIB) secures critical DoD programs and technology by protecting DoD unclassified information resident on and transiting DIB unclassified networks.  This project further establishes the DoD DAMO to coordinate the conduct of assessments involving the loss of DoD information requiring controls resulting from the unauthorized access and\/or exfiltration of technical data maintained on unclassified DIB networks.  The DAMO identifies and categorizes the impact of the loss of acquisition information contained on the affected systems, organizes, and coordinates the assessment reports with all affected components and DIB members, and establishes a process to appropriately share collected information with all affected parties.  The DAMO establishes policy and procedures for conducting damage assessments applicable to all DoD components and in concert with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) procedures pertaining to contracts with the DIB.\n\nSpecific activities include:\n- Provide technical expertise and analyses in assessing the impact of data lost as a result of the unauthorized access and\/or exfiltration. \n- Develop a damage assessment ontology and data repository in order to provide analysis to identify trends in the targeting and compromise of defense program information."

The FCTs enhance interoperability, facilitate international collaboration, expand opportunities for prototyping and enable more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a(g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) Rapid Fielding (RF), Comparative Technology Office (CTO).  The FCT projects are sponsored by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) each year.  Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  \n\nSince the program's inception in 1980, OSD has initiated 671 projects; 619 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 324 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 252 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, deve lopment, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.\n\nThe FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects."

This prototype process has had very promising results and has the potential to reduce the weight and improve the ballistic performance of personal body armor at a lower cost.  The current SAPI plates are made by conventional processing techniques which use low pressure autoclave to bond ceramic tiles and high performance fiber composites together.  The fiber composite materials are processed separately using hot press prior to the final bonding process.  This production method cannot provide uniform high pressure throughout the entire processing and therefore, the ballistic performance of current SAPI plates is not optimized.  The proposed technology has demonstrated the capability to provide absolute uniform and high pressure for the entire process and also to combine fiber composite consolidation and plate integration into a one-step process.  This technology will maximize the bonding strength between fiber composite layers and between composite and the ceramic which will significantly improve the ballistic performance of SAPI plates.  Uniform and high pressure processing technology will also dramatically reduce the performance variation which will provide more trade space for weight reduction.  The technology developed provides a new manufacturing technique that is unique and unavailable from domestic sources."

The portal will expand its use to distribute Air Force Weather processing needs across the enterprise in a net centric mode providing efficiencies, expanded capabilities and cost savings over current approaches.  In particular, it can be used for meteorological data processing and visualization, contain interactive forecasting tools, enhance forecast production and workflow management, and develop adherence to the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) standards for Web Mapping Services (WMS), Web Coverage Services, and Web Feature Services (WFS).  In addition, Visual Weather is compatible with the Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Broker Language (JMBL), which is Air Force Weather\u2019s current Web service approach to the exchange of information between meteorological and oceanographic data providers and user applications.  The use of Visual Weather reduces the time the weather forecaster spends on product generation and allows more time for quality control of the resultant weather product.  The distribution of data across the Air Force Weather Enterprise will also provide a level of Continuity of Operations that currently does not exist if connection to the Air Force Weather Agency is lost."

The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense.  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&L).  Based on the DASD(SE)\u2019s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board, the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program\u2019s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.\n\nThe DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department, providing advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability functions and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  \n\nThe DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities. The DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.\n\nThis PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department\u2019s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical technology, components and information in acquisition programs.  This includes study and maturation of policy, guidance and SSE discipline fundamentals such as engineering methods, tools and best practices.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews."

Comprehensive Program Protection Planning links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.  Activities carried out support implementation of DoD Directive 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology."

As a UARC, the SERC is a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department\u2019s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved systems engineering is essential to the president\u2019s strategy for the Department to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of eighteen research universities from across the US that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD\u2019s systems engineering research problems. \n\nIn prior years, DASD\/SE has resourced the SERC at $1.000 million per year from P142. \n\nThe additional funding, beginning in FY 2014, will increase the Department\u2019s engagement with SERC, supporting additional research on topics of strategic importance to DoD.  \n\nThis new project code, established within the Systems Engineering Program Element:  (1) provides core funding for the SERC; (2) provides adequate stable resources for the SERC research agenda; and (3) enables the SERC to take full advantage of the university collaborators, enabling them to address DoD needs much more effectively."

It serves as the Department\u2019s primary catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to register holdings metadata and search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data in federated architecture data repositories across DoD.  DARS provides a key component of the Department\u2019s net-centric data management capability by federating enterprise architecture data across the Department.  It enables alignment of program architecture components with the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model - consistent with OMB directives for exhibit 300s - via the DoD Business Reference Model.  DARS implements a federated search capability and metadata catalog that will interoperate with the Department\u2019s Net-Centric Enterprise Discovery Service and enterprise content metadata catalog.  Architecture metadata is searchable using the DARS federated discovery web service.  The discovery search results provide links to architecture data that is retrievable based on user roles and access permissions.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the DARS program focus on: (1) Making architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build \u201ccomposite\u201d integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO\u2019s are collaborating in the development of DARS federation web services via the Federated Joint Architecture Working Group under the auspices of the DoD Enterprise Architecture Summit to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model."

In this capacity, the ASD(R&E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for DoD R&E programs.  Additionally, the ASD(R&E) provides technical support to the USD(AT&L) on R&E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&E) (OASD(R&E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&E program and it impacts the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts.  \n\nThe PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the OASD(R&E)).  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and invests in the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) quality of workforce; and (3) global insight of critical or strategic technologies important to the Department and the Nation.\n\nThe PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&T) program and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis program conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.\n\nThe DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&E programs resides in the OASD(R&E).  The OASD(R&E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.\n\nThe PE provides funding for Critical Technology Assessments within OASD(R&E).  Critical Technology Assessments provide the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  \n\nThis PE also provides funding for the Data Vulnerability Tiger Team to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative\/mitigation actions."

Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base.  To maintain full confidence in our systems we must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities. DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks, and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result in the loss of this information.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  We must take steps to understand the loss and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities.  This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production and component manufacturing.\n\nThis project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information and analysis of losses to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action."

It also provides for the assessment of DT&E capabilities of the Military Departments and Department of Defense (DoD) Components, oversees the Test & Evaluation (T&E) career field of the defense acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&E within DoD, and produces the annual DT&E report to Congress.  Specific activities include the following:\n\n- Work with MDAP\/MAIS\/SI Program Managers to develop a comprehensive DT&E strategy that supports acquisition decision milestones.  Ensure that the test strategy beginning at Milestone A, is documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) DT&E also approves or disapproves the developmental test and evaluation plans in the TEMPs.\n- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the systems \nengineering and development planning processes of the Department.\n- Provide formal DT&E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) (pre MS B) and begin production (MS C) with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. \n- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and \ninformation assurance in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).\n- Provide DT&E assessments in support of Nunn-McCurdy certification review teams, and the Director, Performance Assessment and Root Cause Analysis \n(PARCA).\n- Review the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to developmental test and evaluation and identify needed changes or \nimprovements to such organizations and capabilities, and provide input regarding needed changes or improvements for the test and evaluation strategic plan \ndeveloped by Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).\n-As the T&E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification \nstandards to enhance T&E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&E courses to ensure the curriculum \nsupports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training."

It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department\u2019s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department\u2019s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of  issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development."

These investments directly support the new defense strategy and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force. The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)\n- Air Force JNTC\n- Navy JNTC\n\nJNTC:  Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands (CCMD)  to train as they operate.  This investment will develop a cloud-enabled joint training environment, building on previous development of Scenario Management Tools for planning and executing joint training.  In 2016, this investment will enable access at the point of need (Service and CCMD trainers) for planning and executing joint training.  This investment will increase the relevance and realism of training by providing training capabilities which replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.  This program also enables the Department of Defense (DOD) to be responsive to the warfighters\u2019 pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) will decompose, harvest, and reuse DoD investment in joint simulations to develop cloud-enabled modular services (CEMS), reaching Initial Operating Capability in FY16.  JSS will enhance existing Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) and Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) to meet CCMDs\u2019 training requirements.  JSS will provide design and development of web-based applications used as services in CEMS environment.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DOD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  JKDDC JKO is tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&R) CE2T2 Program Goals & Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Items, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKDDC JKO Stakeholder (CCMDs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve:  \n-  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling and simulation based training: These capabilities train and prepare tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined\/Joint Task Force (C\/JTF) billets. Specifically, C\/JTF \u2018battle staffs\u2019 will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  \n-  JKO mobile \u201cpilot\u201d courseware training device development:  This facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms.  \n-  JKO Learning Management System (LCMS): JKO LCMS development is required to deliver JKO courses and track\/report students\u2019 completions more efficiently.  \n-  Develop the future virtual worlds learning environment.  It will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce through an interactive, immersive virtual gaming environment.\n      \nUSFK:  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training & Exercise Support program is developing simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences, tactical to strategic, in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK\u2019s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding is providing a focused upgrade to developing models for space based capabilities and integrated them into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force is also supporting development of cross domain solutions allowing for the linking of systems with differing security requirements, which significantly extend the breadth of the training audiences to additional joint and coalition participants.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate LVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems, developing cross-domain architectures for US and Coalition Forces as well as ensuring sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a common unified standard."

Will design, implement, test, and integrate JSAF enhancements in accordance with requirements.\n\n\u2022 Navy will produce one Navy Training Federation Object Model (FOM) (NTF) release to include applicable documentation updates for the Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) and Federation Agreement document (FAD). Will implement JSAF capability enhancements to support evolving joint and Coalition training requirements.\n\n\u2022 Navy will deliver a JSAF\/JNTC-JLVC FOM interoperability Guide.\n\n\u2022 Navy will facilitate integration by providing dedicated support to the effort, improving the quality of participation and documentation of Navy efforts in the JNTC.  Refine and mature the Navy Training Federation Object Model (NTF), it is improving interoperability and integration with other services and the Joint community.  Provides a standardized FOM for integration across the Navy training simulations.\n\n\u2022 Navy\u2019s current JLVC and other federation simulation distribution are accomplished by tying simulation data to multicast groups.  This is neither a scalable solution nor is it an effective one as federates are not able to publish and subscribe with fine enough precision.  The Simulation Aware Software Router will address this shortcoming, and additionally provide a flexible solution for federating heterogeneous networks and on-the-wire protocols without forcing all federates onto a single, uniform, lowest common denominator solution for each training event.  Ultimately, a simulation aware router will allow simulation users to optimize the network for both simulation scalable traffic and for voice and Command, Control, Communications, (Computers), Intelligence (C4I) traffic."

Criteria for project selection will include factors such as 1) identifiable path of preservation, transformation or innovation between an existing capability and a capability with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term (< 5 years); 2) loss of the capability is likely in the absence of the proposed project; 3) analysis showing that the project results in a lower overall cost to the department than if capability is developed from scratch when needed; and 4) preference is given to projects supporting multiple programs or services with no clearly identifiable principle beneficiary."

These tools collaboratively identify elements of the industrial base where current acquisition programs will not invest enough in production and\/or research to support the minimum sustaining rate that would keep critical suppliers viable.  While industrial base risks identified through these assessment tools are to be mitigated primarily through direct engagement with military departments, agencies, and industry, exceptional cases will require defense-wide intervention via investment accounts, often in collaboration with multiple Services and agencies, to ensure adequate industrial capability to support future defense needs.\n\nThis funding is a key tool for addressing supply chain risks and diminishing manufacturing sources.  Investments are prioritized though a careful analysis at every tier of the supply chain according to a numerical scale of risk-area's fragility and criticality.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific product or service difficult to replace if disrupted; fragility examines characteristics that make small deviations in the status quo likely to have substantial effects on an industry \/ supplier.  These concepts underpin AT&L\u2019s core mission and inform critical investment, budgetary, and programmatic decision-making."

There is a gap between the end of horizontal integration of FLIR and the slated start of I-FLIR modernization.  In order to bridge the gap, the Department plans to maintain the foundry capability and intellectual base of critical suppliers through time-phased lots of IRFPAs.\n\nAdvanced Solid Rocket Propulsion: To support future missile interceptor missions, advanced kill vehicle thrusters for high precision and long duration missions are required.

The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) \u2013 nuclear, biological and chemical threats \u2013 mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD \u2013 it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.\n\nThis PE will fund development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or provide planned product improvements.\n\nThis Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) \u2013 nuclear, biological and chemical threats \u2013 mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD \u2013 it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.\n\nThis PE will fund development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or provide planned product improvements.\n\nThis Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.\n\nSpecifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.\n\nEach Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  \n\nIn addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational commercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL)."

Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.\n\nSpecifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.\n\nEach Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  \n\nIn addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational commercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL)."

Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  \n\n     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the joint information environment architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4&II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission application, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  \n     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint \/Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies."

Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  \n\n     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the joint information environment architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4&II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission application, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  \n     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint \/Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies."

Provides an increase in intelligence disciplines (Imagery Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potential Human Intelligence ) in support of US and Allied\/Coalition forces that currently is very limited to the warfighter.  Increased intelligence advanced analytics tools will be migrated from Joint Intelligence Operations Center-IT and DI2E developments and will significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES\/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters\/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.  Develops and provides a federated TNE that incorporates the Asian Pacific Intelligence Information Network being developed to support the National Defense Strategy as we transition out of Afghanistan and into the Pacific.  Provides multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.  Develops the Coalition Partner Network for CENTCOM, the Coalition Information Exchange Network for SOUTHCOM, and the Coalition Partner Network for EUCOM and AFRICOM.   Develops the US BICES connections with these bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs that make up the US BICES-X Enterprise Network in support of Commander SOCOM requirements for conventional and coalition operations as the US migrates into other Combatant Command regions."

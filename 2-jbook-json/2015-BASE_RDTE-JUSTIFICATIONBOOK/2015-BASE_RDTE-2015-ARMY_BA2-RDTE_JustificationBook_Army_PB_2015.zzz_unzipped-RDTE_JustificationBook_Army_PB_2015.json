The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers of networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors (including Soldier's eyes) from battlefield laser threats; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground and Soldier portfolios.  The work in this project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this area is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and booby traps. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)\/electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. \n\nWork in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC),  Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground Maneuver, Soldier\/Squad and Air portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

The APS common architecture will provide adaptable APS solutions that can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required.  This research includes the development of new modeling and simulation capabilities along with supporting experimental and theoretical approaches to enable active protective systems.  This effort includes integrated information (e.g., battlefield geography, threat launch detection and tracking) and intelligence to inform protection optimization, requiring collaboration across multiple Army organizations.

These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)\/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); and traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power\/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners.   The products of this research are required by developers of Army (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones.  These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.\n\nThis project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground and Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe work in this project is coordinated with the U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  These efforts were previously funded in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork on this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

Component technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), processing and electronics improvements, and modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness. This research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations. This project designs, fabricates and validates very large format IR FPAs needed for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area coverage and the high resolution for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume\/gunflash detection. In addition this project develops multispectral and hyperspectral algorithms for on-chip hyperspectral functionality, which offer the ability to perform detection, identification and signature identification at extended ranges as well as the ability to detect targets in \"deep hide\". Reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. \n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)\/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA."

The digital-in-pixel results in increased signal storage available to collect incoming signal information from the scene, compared to traditional analog techniques. DROIC is an important component in reducing the overall IR sensor cost and SWaP by allowing much smaller FPA pitch. The increased storage improves dynamic range for targeting, situational awareness and persistent surveillance applications."

The focus is on sensor components, sub-components and software algorithms to improve detection of mines, explosive threats and directed energy; ballistic methods to defeat mines and explosive threats; and signature management technologies to reduce reconnaissance capabilities of the enemies. This PE also supports DoD's Center of Excellence for Unexploded Ordnance, which coordinates and standardizes land mine signature models, maintains a catalogue of mine signatures, supports the evaluation of mine detection sensors and algorithms, and working in conjunction with the US Army Engineer, Research and Development Center (ERDC), examines countermine phenomenology of surface and buried mines, and explosive threats. Project H24 advances state of the art Countermine technologies to accurately detect threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo. Project H35 evaluates and develops advanced signature management and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions.  \n\nWork in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM)\/Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)\/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate(NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA."

Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations.  Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nTechnologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

These technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.  New and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide.  Efforts focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond.  This project focuses on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination and other waste streams.  Efforts abroad include a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced and cost effective technologies and\/or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste.  This project focuses on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing mission.\n\nThe work in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This research provides the basis for tools and methods to respond to regulatory constraints, and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis of all new Army materials and chemicals. The specific results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual Army-unique chemicals and materials of concern that minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. This includes development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down. Example areas of research include genomics analysis, cutting edge nanomaterial analysis, and computational\/molecular modeling.  Interim projects are used by PEO Ammo and IEW&S for use in life cycle analysis, risk assessment, and cleanup. Interim products are also US Environmental Protection Agency approved criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures and establishing regulatory limits. The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits on Army lands.\n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include base camp energy reduction initiatives, elimination of waste streams in contingency operations and toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nTechnologies developed in this project are fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0603728A, Project 025. \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Huntsville, AL, the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA, and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, Warren, MI."

This project provides the Army the technical capability to manage, protect and improve the biophysical characteristics of training and testing areas needed for realistic and sustainable ranges and training lands.  Technologies within this project enable users to match mission events and training schedules with the resource capabilities of specific land areas and understand how the use of those resources effect mission support and environmental compliance.  The project investigates, designs, and develops novel methods and technologies to adapt and restore lands damaged during training activities and allow sustained use of Army resources.  The project supports readiness and full use of training lands through development of invasive, threatened, and endangered species monitoring technology and management technologies for species at risk.  The project also designs and develops tools and technologies to avoid training restrictions and reduce constraints on training lands associated with potential impacts from climate change. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets.  Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations (includes Deployable Force Protection).  This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs\/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges.  Project T41 investigates and evaluates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions, and also supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives.  Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations.  Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.  \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology) and PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism, Technology Development).  \n\nWork in this PE is led, managed or performed by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.

This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation.  Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging weapons attacks and enables  maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports Deployable force protection (DFP) efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated in with local communities.      \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground, and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS. Deployable force protection activities are coordinated with research, development and engineering centers and laboratories across the US Army, Navy and Air Force."

The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scalability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.

Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations.  This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians.  Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials.  In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

Research efforts model the dynamics of electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic propagation in response to changing terrain state and complex terrain features and geometry and their depiction in geospatial information and mission command systems.  Numerical modeling of terrain properties as impacted by weather supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command delivered solutions to the Soldier.  The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.\n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This research provides the scientific basis to recruit, select, assign, promote, educate, train, and retain Soldiers and leaders that comprise a ready and relevant Landpower capability.  The human science applied research conducted in this program element provides knowledge-products, methods, techniques, and tools that will enable the Army to: select Soldiers who are predicted to perform well in future jobs; assign Soldiers to Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) and jobs that better match their skills and abilities; retain an effective career force through improved strategies and behavioral incentives to influence Soldiers to stay in the Army for longer periods of time; accelerate the development of leader critical thinking and interpersonal skills through virtual practice so that junior leaders are more adaptable and prepared for uncertain, rapidly changing missions; develop innovative training strategies for complex battle command skills in network-enabled environments; and design training tools for dismounted squad leadership and team maneuver with ground Soldier systems technologies.  Additional research is focused on training techniques and procedures that make it easier for trainers and training developers to rapidly respond to changes in mission or operational requirements and provide a more synergistic training and education process (e.g., automated and improved diagnostics, coaching and mentoring, performance measures, and feedback methods.\n\nWork in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0603007A (Manpower\/Personnel\/Training Technology.)\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Director, Defense Research and Engineering Strategic Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Army Science and Technology Master Plan.\n\nThis project is managed by the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Arlington, VA."

Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft. Belvoir, VA."

Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences. Research is funded in six projects.  \n\nProject 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Soldiers from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices and predictive models used for the refinement of Soldier protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 870 designs and refines medical diagnostic devices, drugs, and vaccines for protection and treatment against naturally occurring diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 873 conducts research on HIV, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus, preclinical work in laboratory animals including non-human primates to identify candidates for future vaccine refinement, and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for future vaccine trials. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program, (DHP). This effort and associated funding was transferred to DHP starting FY14.\n\nProject 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for resuscitation, life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care, as well as trauma care systems for use by field medics and surgeons. Research focus is on identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury and other blast related injuries, and treatments for ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. \n\nProject FH2 conducts applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy force of Warfighters through the entire deployment life cycle.  \n\nProject VB4 conducts applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate iterative biological tests, computer simulations, and animal studies.  Such refinement efforts using systems biology could ultimately reduce the time and effort invested in medical product refinement. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nProject VJ4 examines the mental and behavioral health of Soldiers to counter suicidal behavior. This work focuses on advancing the understanding of the multiple determinants of suicidal behavior, psychopathology (study of the causes and nature of abnormal behavior), psychological resilience, and role functioning. Work on this project is being performed by the National Institute of Mental Health through extramural cooperative research grants in collaboration with the Department of the Army. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (referred to as preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and assay refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves preclinical testing in animals. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee. The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.\n\nWork funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A and the Defense Health Program.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment and the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Fort Sam Houston, TX; U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD."

Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:\n\n(1) Drugs to Prevent\/Treat Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases\n(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria\n(3) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control\n(4) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(5) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n\nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nWork is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories."

This research focuses on enhanced protection of Soldiers against health threats in military operations and training. Stressors that adversely affect individual Soldier health readiness are identified and studied to refine interventions that will protect Soldiers and improve their health and performance in stressful environments. This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nForce Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:\n(1) Millennium Cohort Research\n(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring\n(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries\n \nPromising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project FH4.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n \nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care."

This study funds research to examine the mental and behavioral health of Soldiers and related suicidal behavior. Army STARRS component studies (Historical Data Study, New Soldier Study, All Army Study, Soldier Health Outcomes Study, and Pre\/Post Deployment Study) examine historical and administrative data collected by the Army from Soldiers in all phases of Army service. As of July 2013, more than 100,000 Soldiers volunteered to participate in Army STARRS. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork on this project is performed by The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) with the Department of the Army providing program oversight. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Military Operational Medicine."

                            "val": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system, which operates through all weather. GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations.  GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide.  GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time.  GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds the Research & Development (R&D) for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI).  This includes advanced concept development, systems analysis, modernized control segment development, mission planning development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, developmental test resources, systems engineering required to meet the government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification.  OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (Navwar) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations and 4) integrate DoD information assurance controls and capabilities.  GPS Enterprise Integrator is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.\n\nOCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved required capabilities.\n\nGPS supports both military and civil users in air, space, sea and land operations. The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments.  The government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, allied, and commercial GPS users. \n \nThe GPS Enterprise Integrator project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community.  The Enterprise Integrator maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops\/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further, the Enterprise Integrator provides modeling, simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification.\n\nIn addition, the GPS Enterprise Integrator project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this, the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments.  In this capacity, the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.  GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules, conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans; and System Test Plans and Procedures.  GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases.  The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions.  This enhances the government control, oversight and program accountability.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This project funds the research and development for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX).  This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment and mission planning, development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and developmental test resources.\n\nThe OCX acquisition was established to accomplish the following four objectives: 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation warfare (Navwar) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations, and 4) implement DoD information assurance controls and capabilities.  OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, technology development, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities. \n\nOCX Block 0 (Iterations 1.4 and 1.5) is the Launch and Control System (LCS) intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the on-orbit checkout of all GPS III satellites.  OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.  \n\nOCX Block 1 (adds Iterations 1.6 and 1.7 to Block 0) fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and civil signals (L1C\/A), military signals (L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the modernized civil signal (L2C) and the aviation safety-of-flight signal (L5).  It also fully meets information assurance\/cyber defense requirements.\n\nOCX Block 2 (adds Iteration 2.1 to Block 1) fields the operational capability to control the modernized signals (L1M and L2M (M-Code)), and the globally compatible signal (L1C)."

The Government Program Office owns and approves the technical baseline and is responsible for the successful fielding of all the GPS Segments.  To successfully execute its responsibilities, the Government relies upon the specific expertise of the GPS Enterprise Integrator to integrate segment products and verify that system requirements are met.\n\nThe GPS Enterprise Integrator project is responsible for the development and management of the Enterprise technical baseline.  The technical baseline consists of more than 6400 specifications and 330 interface documents.  The technical baseline reflects the requirements of multiple stakeholder groups such as the Department of Defense (DoD), foreign governments and allies, industry, the general public (through four Interface specifications), and ensures GPS capabilities meet the needs of warfighters, civil agencies, commercial entities, international treaties, and over 4B global GPS users.  The Enterprise Integrator manages the process through which the JROC requirements are matured and flowed down to the segments of the system and that interfaces are clearly defined.  This enables the GPS system to meet Title 10 of the U.S. Code, Section 2281, mandated GPS capabilities as well as obligations to the international community and allied nations, to provide, inter-operable PNT signals.  The Enterprise Integrator is also responsible for all aspects of schedule and technical alignment across the segments.  The Enterprise Integrator creates and manages plans that provide for early exercise of the products under development, compatibility analysis, and intersegment testing thereby reducing risk.  The intersegment tests are required to prove the interoperability of OCX, GPS III, and modernized user equipment.  The Enterprise Integrator's test efforts also extend to validating that GPS can be used for civil aircraft navigation.\n\nThe Enterprise Integrator activity supports the Government Program Office's GPS spectrum protection at international forums such as the International Telecommunications Union, assisting the United States when negotiating with foreign partners.  In addition, the Enterprise Integrator provides technical expertise and continuity for maintaining relationships with other U.S. government agencies to include the FAA, NGA, NASA, as well as the Departments of State, Transportation, Homeland Security, and Commerce.  Spectrum expertise from the Enterprise Integrator ensures GPS priority over eight essential spectrum signals such as the safety of life signal, L5, which is required for civil air navigation.  Spectrum Protection prevents encroachment from commercial or foreign entities, which preserves reliable signals to warfighters and civil users, ensuring military operations and the integrity of the global economic infrastructure.  The Enterprise Integrator is the GPS enterprise expert for Information Assurance (IA), System Safety, and System Security, ultimately ensuring a protected GPS Signal for both the military and civil users from emerging cyber threats.  The Enterprise Integrator is accountable for the development, execution, and analysis of OCX IA test cases, which are necessary to deliver a secure, operational system, protected against adversarial cyber-attacks intended to deny, disrupt, or degrade GPS operations.\n\nThe Enterprise Integrator supports the Government development and implementation of various Systems engineering documents, defines the methods of verification, conducts the analyses or tests, and assists the government in leading Integrated System Tests.  The Enterprise Integrator validates the system performance in various mission threat scenarios during its development.  The Enterprise Integrator provides deep, technical, highly specific expertise that the government utilizes to enhances the government control, oversight and program accountability."

This complex inter-segment integration is traditionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract.  To eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) contractor.  GPS Enterprise Integrator function of the SE&I contractor is currently funded within this Program Element (PE).  The SE&I effort was originally procured in 2007 through a full and open competition.  It was subsequently extended to support the timing and competitive award of a new SE&I contract which is currently in a full and open competition source selection.  The SE&I follow-on strategy builds in year over year cost reductions as requirements stabilize."

The greater overall system performance will tighten dispersion capability where multiple weapons are released from the same aircraft on the same pass, and hit the same impact crater.  The BLU-113 is an objective requirement of the 2002 JDAM Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  Weapon system will have an identical Concept of Operations (CONOPS) as existing USAF inventory for Global Positioning System-aided Inertial Navigation System (GPS-aided INS) weapons, and compatibility with aircraft Operational Flight Profile (OFP).  \n\nBA-07 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The system represents the AF commitment to modernizing business practices and providing enhanced support for today's service members and their families. AFIPPS will align with DoD data standards for personnel, pay, and accounting, including the Common Human Resource Information Standards (CHRIS), which will ensure compliance with the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).  AFIPPS will provide Enterprise Information Web (EIW) services.  The AFIPPS program will be bound by using the BEA \"Hire-to-Retire\" (H2R) construct.  Eighty-four percent of the BEA's H2R activities are within the scope of AFIPPS.\n\nThe purpose of AFIPPS is to provide the AF with a sustainable, cost-effective, auditable, and regulatory compliant method of effectively capturing and maintaining personnel information so that Service members are paid accurately and on-time without requiring repetitive action or onerous paperwork, while allowing commanders\/managers to easily access pertinent information.\n\nThe goal of AFIPPS, as documented in the Capability Development Document (CDD) signed 05 Jul 11, is to fully integrate personnel and pay management for the AF's Total Force (Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFRes)).  The future state will be characterized by streamlined, Total Force business processes; efficient and accurate management of pay entitlements; auditable financial statements with regard to military pay; improved access to accurate and timely personnel data for authorized users; and a modernized IT systems environment that is cost-effective and can adapt to future needs.\n\nAFIPPS's customers include approximately 507,000 AF Service members across all components (330,000 RegAF, 107,000 ANG, and 70,000 AFRes) as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure Service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.  Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The system represents the AF commitment to modernizing business practices and providing enhanced support for today's service members and their families. AFIPPS will align with DoD data standards for personnel, pay, and accounting, including the Common Human Resource Information Standards (CHRIS), which will ensure compliance with the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).  AFIPPS will provide Enterprise Information Web (EIW) services.  The AFIPPS program will be bound by using the BEA \"Hire-to-Retire\" (H2R) construct.  Eighty-four percent of the BEA's H2R activities are within the scope of AFIPPS.\n\nThe purpose of AFIPPS is to provide the AF with a sustainable, cost-effective, auditable, and regulatory compliant method of effectively capturing and maintaining personnel information so that Service members are paid accurately and on-time without requiring repetitive action or onerous paperwork, while allowing commanders\/managers to easily access pertinent information.\n\nThe goal of AFIPPS, as documented in the Capability Development Document (CDD) signed 05 Jul 11, is to fully integrate personnel and pay management for the AF's Total Force (Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFRes)).  The future state will be characterized by streamlined, Total Force business processes; efficient and accurate management of pay entitlements; auditable financial statements with regard to military pay; improved access to accurate and timely personnel data for authorized users; and a modernized IT systems environment that is cost-effective and can adapt to future needs.\n\nAFIPPS's customers include approximately 507,000 AF Service members across all components (330,000 RegAF, 107,000 ANG, and 70,000 AFRes) as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure Service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.  Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Each capability release builds upon and incorporates the previous baseline.  Contract 1 includes the effort to blueprint for all releases with an option to develop, integrate, test, train, deploy, and sustain Release 1 (Leave).  The primary contract type is Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF).  Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) are used for the smaller portions of the contract, as appropriate.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for Contract 2 includes separate task orders, each of which represents a fieldable capability for the Air Force human resources mission.  AFIPPS will provide a fully integrated personnel and pay service capability for the Total Force to fully utilize capabilities in the COTS software, minimize customization of the ERP and sustainment costs and maximize the life of the system.  Contract 2 plans to use a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) which will be determined via the Contract 2 acquisition strategy process.\n\nAir Force Program Executive Officer for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AFIPPS.

The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware\/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank\/library of Anti-Tamper technologies, providing proper security mechanisms, and conducting effective validation and verification of  AT implementations.  The purpose of AT is to protect critical program information in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT protections will permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters mission requirements.  Furthermore, AT will add longevity to DoD critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against a system or system component. \n  \nThe DoD ATEA will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the DoD Services\/Agencies, National Laboratories, and industry.  The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhancing existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL).  The AT technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in multiple areas, including the following:  Advanced sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and power solutions.  Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs and smaller form factor.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapons systems.  Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.\n\nAll DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) and\/or resident-critical program information (R-CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for the subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government of the shelf products.  To maintain its advantage, the AT program continues to improve its AT hardware\/software assessment capabilities.   These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and\/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and\/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding."

The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware\/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank\/library of Anti-Tamper technologies, providing proper security mechanisms, and conducting effective validation and verification of  AT implementations.  The purpose of AT is to protect critical program information in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT protections will permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters mission requirements.  Furthermore, AT will add longevity to DoD critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against a system or system component. \n  \nThe DoD ATEA will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the DoD Services\/Agencies, National Laboratories, and industry.  The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhancing existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL).  The AT technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in multiple areas, including the following:  Advanced sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and power solutions.  Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs and smaller form factor.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapons systems.  Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.\n\nAll DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) and\/or resident-critical program information (R-CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for the subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government of the shelf products.  To maintain its advantage, the AT program continues to improve its AT hardware\/software assessment capabilities.   These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and\/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and\/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding."

                            "val": "B-52 SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS (BPAC 675039)\nProject 675039 System Improvements, changed from B-52 Modernization.\n\nB-52 System Improvements is a comprehensive project to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks, navigation, sensors, weapons, electronic warfare (EW), and training capabilities. B-52 System Improvements integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control, targeting, and intelligence. It upgrades antiquated Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology: Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS). B-52 System Improvements upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability. In addition, it improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system. It studies, analyzes, and tests aircraft systems' hardness to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons effects, such as Low Level Continuous Wave (LLCW) and High altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Survivability tests. It upgrades mission critical systems to survive in CBRN environments. B-52 System Improvements upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver, jammers, chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).\n\nEngineering Studies & Analysis and Test & Evaluation\nB-52 system improvements funds test activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), engineering and planning studies for potential future weapon system enhancements (weapons, sensors, avionics, and EW) and emerging requirement on current projects, upgrades to the B-52 Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), Avionics Integration Support Facility (AISF), and Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), and weapon system operational\/safety, supportability, reliability, and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) improvements.\n\nAdditional Efforts\nB-52 system improvements funds additional efforts that stem from the operation and maintenance of a 50-plus-year-old aircraft, such as parts obsolescence, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), and emerging requirements to add to or maintain the existing capabilities. Examples include, but are not limited to upgrades to outdated avionics computers, mission planning interfaces to Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), upgrades to the EW suite, and studies and analysis. All B-52 development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.\n\nB-52 COMBAT NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CONECT) (BPAC 675050)\nThe B-52 CONECT acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates: on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions; UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP) based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and retargeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirement's Oversight Capability Council (AFROCC) on 18 March 2004.\n\nTrainers and Upgrades for CONECT\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update\/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.\n\nB-52 1760 INTERNAL WEAPONS BAY UPGRADE (IWBU) (BPAC 675048)\nThe 1760 IWBU requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft, which includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the AFROCC in April 2013. The 1760 IWBU project provides internal and external carriage for eight weapons and consists of two sub increments: 1.1 and 1.2.\n\nIncrement 1.1 consists of internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants, to include Laser JDAM (LJDAM), on a rotary launcher. Additionally, this increment develops the capability for external carriage for 16 LJDAM.\n\nIncrement 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J). This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.\n\nB-52 MODE S\/5 IFF (BPAC 675049)\nMode S\/5 Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF) is part of the Communication Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) effort and will develop and integrate modern IFF technology into the B-52 to enable it to operate in the evolving air traffic environment. This effort is driven by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to comply with performance standards to allow the B-52 to operate safely in controlled airspaces. Aircraft not equipped with appropriate capabilities will not be able to operate in airspace where new separation standards and air traffic management procedures are implemented. An additional benefit is the significant fuel savings that will result in being able to fly at optimum and more efficient routes and altitudes. DoD mandates Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 047-07 (signed March 2007) and JROCM 122-08 (signed June 2008) dictate replacement of the B-52's APX-64 IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) Transponder with a modern Mode S\/5 transponder.  This requirement was validated by Air Force Form 1067, signed in November 2011.\n\nB-52 ANTI-SKID REPLACEMENT (BPAC 675051)\nThe B-52 Anti-skid system is used to maintain control of aircraft during landings and taxi operations. The B-52 Anti-skid system prevents aircraft skidding by sensing the exact amount of brake pressure needed for safe braking under all runway conditions without tire damage. Previous B-52 Anti-skid supportability analysis, completed in 2006 by General Atomics indicated a supportability end date of 2011, based on parts obsolescence, a lack of test equipment, and a lack of repair personnel. Parts obsolescence continues to be a major supportability factor. However, since the previous analysis, test equipment and new depot maintenance procedures to refurbish previously failed Anti-skid detectors have been put in place in order to provide spares through 2015 when the replacement will be available. The Anti-skid Replacement project develops and installs a new system. This effort includes an upgrade of the maintenance trainers. This requirement was validated by Air Force Form 1067, signed in July 2009.\n\nARMS CONTROL ACTIVITIES (Funding is in the ARMS Control PE, 0305145F)\nArms Control Activities under the New START Treaty drives the need to modify a number of B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Code Enable Switch and associated equipment. This effort requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.\n\nThese projects are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

B-52 System Improvements integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control, targeting, and intelligence.  It upgrades antiquated Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology:  Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  B-52 System Improvements upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability.  In addition, it improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system.  It studies, analyzes, and tests aircraft systems' hardness to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons effects, such as Low Level Continuous Wave (LLCW) and High altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Survivability tests.  It upgrades mission critical systems to survive in CBRN environments.  B-52 System Improvements upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver, jammers, chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).   \n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "MIL-STD-1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft, which includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. The 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments.  Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage for eight weapons and consists of two sub increments: 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Capability Council (AFROCC) in April 2013.\n\nIncrement 1.1 \n\nIncrement 1.1 consists of internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants, to include Laser JDAM (LJDAM), on a rotary launcher. This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 16 LJDAM. The CRL Hardware modification consists of Group A (equipment racks and electrical wiring) and Group B (one Survivability\/Vulnerability (SV) junction box and one Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) per CRL). The IWIU Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) was previously developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) project. No CSRL replacements will be required as a result of this project.  Increment 1.1 completed Preliminary Design Review in February 2013 and awarded an EMD contract in September 2013.  Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in October 2013.\n\nAircraft Hardware Development:  None\n\nSoftware Development: Consists of modifying aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) software, JDAM Stores Management Overlays (SMO) and ground based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).\n\nCRL Hardware Development: Consists of modifying USSTRATCOM provided CSRLs by replacing nuclear mission equipment with Group B hardware and wiring interfaces. Group A includes equipment racks and electrical wiring; Group B includes one Survivability\/Vulnerability (SV) junction box and one IWIU per CRL. The IWIU LRU was previously developed under the AWI project and work was previously accomplished during a 2005 demonstration and developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding.  Three CSRLs will be modified using RDT&E funds.\n\nSupport Equipment:  Consists of developing software and 38 rotary launcher cable adapter sets on existing Multi-Use System Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG) testers to interface with the CRL. \n\n\nIncrement 1.2 \n\nIncrement 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J).  This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.\n\nAircraft Hardware Development:  Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements, for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft, and two GITA aircraft. \n\nSoftware Development: Development of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground based JMPS.\n\nCRL Hardware Development: Develops Group A associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (one power supply and one power distribution box).  Three CRLs will be modified using RDT&E funds.\n\nSupport Equipment:  Consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment.\n\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This effort is driven by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to comply with performance standards to allow the B-52 to operate safely in controlled airspaces.  Aircraft not equipped with appropriate capabilities will not be able to operate in airspace where new separation standards and air traffic management procedures are implemented. An additional benefit is the significant fuel savings that will result in being able to fly at optimum and more efficient routes and altitudes. DoD mandates Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 047-07 (signed March 2007) and JROCM 122-08 (signed June 2008) dictate replacement of the B-52's APX-64 IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) Transponder with a modern Mode S\/5 transponder.  This requirement was validated by Air Force Form 1067, signed in November 2011.   \n\nCNS\/ATM \nCapabilities identified under CNS\/ATM activities will include Frequency Modulation (FM) immunity management, digital communications (voice and data), improved navigation accuracy such as Required Navigation Performance (RNP) or Global Positioning System (GPS) enhancements, Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM), enhanced situational awareness such as Mode S\/Mode 5 IFF, Communications Management Unit, HF Data Link, Auto Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Selective Availability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM) and any follow-on activities to associated components\/systems resulting from modifications to CNS\/ATM systems.\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates:  on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions.  This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirement's Oversight Capability Council (AFROCC) on 18 March 2004.\n\nAdditional funds have been added to the project for the completion of the CONECT capability development and the CONECT capability inclusion into the required B-52 training systems, and production\/installation\/initial support for a total of 76 CONECT capable aircraft (2 kits were funded in EMD).

The test aircraft will maintain the installed CONECT configuration and will be used to evaluate efforts to maintain and\/or update B-52 CONECT capabilities.  As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication requirements (upgrades to IBR, JRE messages, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade, Mode S\/Mode 5 Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF), etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT. \n\nTRAINERS AND UPGRADES FOR CONECT\nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update\/maintain the system integration laboratory (SIL) for the Weapon System Trainers (WST).\n  \nThis project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The B-52 Anti-skid system prevents aircraft skidding by sensing the exact amount of brake pressure needed for safe braking under all runway conditions without tire damage.  Previous B-52 Anti-skid supportability analysis, completed in 2006 by General Atomics indicated a supportability end date of 2011, based on parts obsolescence, a lack of test equipment, and a lack of repair personnel.  Parts obsolescence continues to be a major supportability factor.  However, since the previous analysis, test equipment and new depot maintenance procedures to refurbish previously failed Anti-skid detectors have been put in place in order to provide spares through 2015 when the replacement will be available.  The Anti-skid Replacement project develops and installs a new system.  This effort includes an upgrade of the maintenance trainers.  This requirement was validated by Air Force Form 1067, signed in July 2009.\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Armed with a W80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage.  \n\nThe purpose of this program is to ensure ALCM sustainability through 2030 in support of Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and global strike mission requirements.\n\nAn ALCM Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was developed to support ALCM Service Life through 2030.  The results of SLEP studies identified system components and support equipment that will become non-supportable prior to 2030.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) deliberate planning commitments. Development funds are required to add capabilities to assist in identifying candidate components for future SLEP efforts.\n\nThe Aging and Surveillance program for ALCM continuously assesses critical components such as those in the safe arm and fuze subsystem, navigation\/guidance system, and electrical\/power distribution system.  The program identifies aging trends prior to failures in fielded components that would result in fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems.  Development funds are required to update software, test procedures, and test equipment.  FY15 funding will complete the Guided Missile Flight Controller sub-component testing and allow for the development of test capabilities for additional ALCM components.  \n\nAs part of the build phase of the sustaining engineering approach, the program has developed a plan for ALCM sustainment using a computer-aided decision making process called the ALCM Sustainment Enhancement Toolbox (ASET).  The first phase of ASET is the ALCM Report Recommendation Tool (ARRT).  FY15 funds are required to continue developing test procedures to implement the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS)-directed requirement for High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) testing for nuclear systems.\n\nBA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Armed with a W80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage.  \n\nThe purpose of this program is to ensure ALCM sustainability through 2030 in support of Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and global strike mission requirements.\n\nAn ALCM Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was developed to support ALCM Service Life through 2030.  The results of SLEP studies identified system components and support equipment that will become non-supportable prior to 2030.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) deliberate planning commitments. Development funds are required to add capabilities to assist in identifying candidate components for future SLEP efforts.\n\nThe Aging and Surveillance program for ALCM continuously assesses critical components such as those in the safe arm and fuze subsystem, navigation\/guidance system, and electrical\/power distribution system.  The program identifies aging trends prior to failures in fielded components that would result in fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems.  Development funds are required to update software, test procedures, and test equipment.  FY15 funding will complete the Guided Missile Flight Controller sub-component testing and allow for the development of test capabilities for additional ALCM components.  \n\nAs part of the build phase of the sustaining engineering approach, the program has developed a plan for ALCM sustainment using a computer-aided decision making process called the ALCM Sustainment Enhancement Toolbox (ASET).  The first phase of ASET is the ALCM Report Recommendation Tool (ARRT).  FY15 funds are required to continue developing test procedures to implement the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS)-directed requirement for High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) testing for nuclear systems.\n\nBA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range, conventional bomber.  It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the United States Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.\n\nThis effort provides funding for B-1B modernization programs.  These modernization programs alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. \n\nFunds address upgrades to the Secure Line of Sight (SLOS) \/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) \/ Air Radio Communication (ARC-210) voice capability.  The SLOS\/BLOS ARC 210 voice capability adds secure voice capabilities to the radio currently utilized only for secure data.  This will add much needed capability to our forces currently operating in forward locations.  This program is an Urgent Operational Need (UON).\n\nB-1B training systems upgrades(both flight and maintenance simulators\/trainers) are complementary to the aircraft Central Integrated Test System (CITS), Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization programs.  These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft.  The B-1B training system provides the war fighter fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.  \n\nAircraft RDT&E efforts include development of a Self-Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI).  This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude indicator, altimeter, and airspeed indicator) with a more reliable\/supportable commercial off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device.   If the primary flight instruments are lost, SCAI will continue to provide the primary flight information needed to fly the aircraft.  Standby instrumentation must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight.  \n\nUpgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current.  RDT&E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering, Manufacture, and Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU.  Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration.  Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established.  Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.  \n\nAdditionally, program funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development programs that have not yet fielded.  Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost.  All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. \n\t\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development; budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the United States Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.\n\nThis effort provides funding for B-1B modernization programs.  These modernization programs alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. \n\nFunds address upgrades to the Secure Line of Sight (SLOS) \/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) \/ Air Radio Communication (ARC-210) voice capability.  The SLOS\/BLOS ARC 210 voice capability adds secure voice capabilities to the radio currently utilized only for secure data.  This will add much needed capability to our forces currently operating in forward locations.  This program is an Urgent Operational Need (UON).\n\nB-1B training systems upgrades(both flight and maintenance simulators\/trainers) are complementary to the aircraft Central Integrated Test System (CITS), Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization programs.  These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft.  The B-1B training system provides the war fighter fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.  \n\nAircraft RDT&E efforts include development of a Self-Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI).  This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude indicator, altimeter, and airspeed indicator) with a more reliable\/supportable commercial off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device.   If the primary flight instruments are lost, SCAI will continue to provide the primary flight information needed to fly the aircraft.  Standby instrumentation must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight.  \n\nUpgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current.  RDT&E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering, Manufacture, and Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU.  Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration.  Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established.  Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.  \n\nAdditionally, program funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development programs that have not yet fielded.  Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost.  All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. \n\t\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development; budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The unique combination of range, precision, payload, and ability to operate in anti-access area denial environments allow the B-2 to identify, locate, target, and destroy the highest value enemy targets. The B-2 can, with necessary upgrades, accomplish its mission regardless of location, return to base safely, and permit freedom of movement for follow-on forces, including other long range strike platforms. An array of planned RDT&E projects are necessary to preserve a strategic advantage against 21st century threats as well as increase flexibility, lethality, and survivability of this national asset tasked across a broad spectrum of tactical and national strategic objectives. B-2 will achieve these objectives by adapting mature technologies\/systems in the fleet to rapidly deliver affordable and relevant combat capability, leveraging other Department of Defense investments and programs utilizing innovative acquisition strategies.  \n\nThe B-2 has a projected service life through 2058. To ensure the fleet can accomplish its nuclear and conventional mission in highly defended and anti-access environments, periodic modernization efforts must be undertaken to upgrade combat capability as well as improve the viability, supportability, and survivability of the weapon system.  Recent and ongoing investments in avionics, structures, communications, and weapons upgrades keep the B-2 viable in the immediate future. Current system upgrades include Defensive Management System Modernization, Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and Computers Increments 1, alternative communication solutions such as Common Very Low Frequency Receiver and Adaptable Communications Suite, Massive Ordnance Penetrator integration and modernization of Global Positioning System hardware and signal enhancement, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff missile-Extended Range integration, Flexible Strike Phase 1, Link-16 Center Instrument Display\/In-Flight Replanner, Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications, Aircraft Supportability Modifications, Training System Upgrades, Mission Planning System improvements, flight test aircraft upgrades and base of operations support, Advanced Low Detection Data Link studies, other weapons integration and engine improvements, as well as B-2 platform studies and acquisition planning.\n\nB-2 modernization of weapons carriage and armament interfaces, communications, navigation, avionics, and supportability efforts will establish an improved foundation for Moving Target Kill and Non-Traditional Surveillance and Reconnaissance combat capabilities necessary to ensure air superiority in 21st century nuclear and conventional combat environments. Flexible Strike Phase 2 efforts will modify Stores Management hardware and software necessary to accommodate integration of updated conventional and nuclear System 2 weapons into the B-2 fleet.  It will provide for mixed carriage of an assortment of weapons on the B-2, providing any combination of weapons in both B-2 weapons bays.  B-2 will have the capability to carry a fully loaded conventional Rotary Launcher Assembly along with a fully loaded Smart Bomb Rack Assembly or a Monitor and Control Assembly with Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapon on a single B-2 aircraft, providing unprecedented capability to destroy a wider array of target sets.  Other efforts include: the development of a Universal Armament Interface, integrating multi-platform advanced data links with high bandwidth satellite communication links, integration of the Global Positioning System M-Code hardware and software necessary for modernization of Air Traffic Management communications\/navigation\/ surveillance systems, and enhancement of the Mode 5\/S Identification Friend or Foe system with Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast capability mandated by US and European military and civil aviation agencies to improve situational awareness of controlled and contested airspaces. Finally, improvements are required on the B-2 data\/voice\/video recorders to comply with Air Force Safety Board mandates to provide specific flight and aircraft data, frequency of update, data precision, and recording duration that do not exist in the B-2 recorders today.\n\nAfter the above modifications are implemented, the B-2 fleet will be poised to deliver a Moving Target Kill combat capability, forming a foundation to exploit the modularity and improved precision algorithms of Universal Armament Interface. The inherent low observable characteristics of the B-2 will enable accomplishment of a Non-Traditional Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission. Necessary modifications include, but are not limited to, enhancement of current radar modes, high resolution improvements to the synthetic aperture radar, and improved information fusion required to gather, analyze, and communicate enemy movements and combat capabilities to friendly follow-on forces, the National Command Authority, and other operation centers via the Global Information Grid.\n\nIn FY13, Defensive Management System Modernization transfered to PE 65931F, project 653844.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics\/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, support equipment development, as well as studying future Integrated Strike Warfare and Advanced Tactical Data Link integration requirements.\n\nLow Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) and Aircraft Supportability Modifications (ASM) directly address B-2 aircraft availability, the primary stated B-2 user requirement.  Given the extremely small fleet size (20 aircraft), mission accomplishment is particularly sensitive to the availability of this high-demand strategic asset.  LOSSM projects increase aircraft availability, decrease low observable (LO) maintenance,  and maintain and improve the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet ensuring survivable combat operations. LOSSM projects improve materials, structures, and diagnostic tools necessary to evaluate LO materials and systems in the B-2 fleet. LOSSM structure improvement projects include, but are not limited to, advanced high frequency materials placement, windshield bounce patch and tape improvements, composite plies, advanced signature reduction, and radome improvements.  Material improvements include, but are not limited to, tailpipe and inlet coatings, pre-cured gap fillers, and other advanced LO materials development. Diagnostic tool efforts include, but are not limited to, improved radar frequency diagnostics, signature diagnostic system database upgrades, Tier One Material Inspection System improvements, Portable Laser Removal Tool development, Integrated Collections And Reporting System, Mobile Diagnostics Laboratory, Ground Air Radar System development, and other low observable special test equipment and information systems upgrades.\n\nThe Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines as well as reduce maintenance manhours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand\/low density fleet. Potential structural and avionics modifications include, but are not limited to, B-2 Common Processor, Proximity Sensor Logic Unit, Generator Control Unit, Rudder Access Panel and Elevon Drain Hole upgrades, Cockpit Voice and Flight Data Recorder, Radomes, Audio Control Display Unit, Center Instrument Display improvements, Aft Deck Doublers, Center Instrument Display connection to the aircraft Digital Video Recorder, Multi-function Information Distribution System Power Transfer, Global Positioning System Splitter Cable, Airborne Integrated Terminal Crypto, and upgraded cryptological functionality of all B-2 communications systems as necessary.  Engine improvements include, but are not limited to, the F118 engine Service Life Extension Program, Extended Mission Oil Tank, and the Next Generation Engine Core upgrade. Stage 1 and 3 engine fan blade improvements will reduce engine changes while increasing aircraft availability and reducing maintenance costs. Engine upgrades are necessary to maintain commonality with the F110 engine core and reduce maintenance and repair costs of divergent engine configurations.   \n\nModern communications are key enablers for the B-2 in the Anti-Access\/Area Denial battlespace, and directly enhance lethality and force multiplication. The Common Very Low Frequency (VLF) Receiver effort develops and integrates a receive-only very low bandwidth VLF receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-2.  The receiver will be adaptable for use by other Department of Defense platforms. Secure, survivable two-way communications in an Anti-Access\/Area Denial environment remains a requirement for the B-2, and the Air Force will study requirements and potential efforts which might address those requirements. The Adaptable Communications Suite provides a non-integrated communications system that allows B-2 to receive a complete integrated mission, time sensitive targeting information, intelligence updates, and positive command and control procedures while en route to a combat theater. Link-16 Center Instrument Display\/In-Flight Replanner upgrade allows B-2 access to theater tactical data links, improving on-board situational awareness while greatly enhancing the ability of theater commanders to coordinate B-2 with other assets.  Mode 5\/S Identification Friend or Foe with Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast will provide improved situational awareness of controlled and contested airspaces in the United States and Europe.\n \nB-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and\/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to destroy a wider array of target sets, to include moving target sets, and hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. Integration of the 30K pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) provides the nation with the ability to hold additional hardened, deeply buried targets at risk that are currently unachievable with 5K pound penetrator munitions. The B-2 is the only anti-access area denial penetrating platform capable of carrying the MOP, a capability which meets Urgent Operational Need requirements. The MOP integration project designs, develops, integrates, and tests hardware, software, and support equipment required for carriage, jettison, and release of two MOP weapons from the B-2. The MOP integration effort also includes modernization of the Global Positioning Signal (GPS) antenna enabling an enhanced GPS signal to be routed into the weapon bays to allow Monitor and Control Equipment (MACE) weapons, Smart Bomb Rack Assembly (SBRA) weapons, and Rotary Launch Assembly (RLA) weapons to acquire and track GPS satellites prior to weapons release, maintaining unjammed delivery accuracy in a jamming environment. The MOP Quick Reaction Capability effort includes dual fuze control and single Smart Bomb Rack Controller per bay weapon control and monitor. The Flexible Strike Phase 1 program will recombine and rehost the current B-2 stores management software onto a new integrated processor; Flexible Strike Phase 2 will update other Operational Flight Plans and hardware to enable simultaneous configuration of multiple weapons carriage capabilities, providing B-2 with maximum strategic nuclear and conventional strike flexibility.  Planned weapons integration efforts also include integration of currently fielded weapons and upgraded weapons such as, but not limited to, GBU-28 E\/B Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) with impact angle control, GBU-28D\/B SAASM with impact angle control, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuse, extended range Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, JDAM-5000, GBU 56, Long Range Standoff Missile, and Small Diameter Bomb II. The B-2 Weapons System Tester and its associated Test Program Sets (TPS), to include but not limited to, the Common Organizational Level Tester (COLT), MUSTANG, and B-2 Armament Tester, will be continually upgraded for increased reliability and performance to support current and new B-2 weapon suspension and release systems. \n\nPeculiar support equipment development activities include design, development, test, and procurement of new peculiar support equipment, to include but not limited to, special test equipment for newly emerging test and support requirements of legacy B-2 capabilities and\/or functionality. Development of new peculiar support equipment will support test and sustainment activities at the B-2 Weapon System Support Center Ground Test Facility, Program Depot Maintenance facility, Test Range facilities, and AFGSC operating locations.\n\nThe B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification.  Improvements include, but are not limited to, threat systems parametrics and order of battle information, radar display emulation improvements, improved aero fidelity of key pilot procedures, courseware improvements, and upgrades to display systems, subsystems, and simulation and computational processors. Other upgrades include, but are not limited to, conventional and nuclear guided weapons delivery training, expanded crypto keyfill capability in simulators, upgraded capability to train weapons as powered up upon completion of initial conditions, as well as upgrades to the electronic combat environment threat database tools to include threat laydown, threat parametrics, and Integrated Air Defense System. Upgrades also include the current Defensive Management System (DMS) simulation, improved DMS alternative\/ emergency procedures courseware, and upgraded Mission Generation System, Suppressor tool, and simulation and computational processors as necessary. Enhancements are provided to the B-2 family of trainers to include the Weapon System Trainers, Mission Trainer, Cockpit Procedures Trainers, Computerized Maintenance Training System, Weapon System Training Aids, Weapons Load Trainer, Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, Flight Control System Trainer, instructor-operator station, and Training System Support Center.\n\nThe Integrated Strike Warfare Airborne Network effort models and simulates combat effects and performance constraints in an environment that can demonstrate, integrate, generate, and validate four generic waveform models which will be used on the B-2 platform. Additionally, this effort establishes a viable end-to-end distributed modeling and simulation network. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Additionally, the new Integrated Processing Units and Disk Drive Unit architectures establish a high-speed fiber optic structure network while maintaining connectivity to legacy interfaces.  This upgrade provides the required processing growth path to future B-2 upgrades such as, but not limited to, future communications capabilities, Defensive Management System Modernization, Flexible Strike, B61-12 and other weapons integration efforts.   \n\nFour kits were developed with Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds for three aircraft installs, which includes two Force Development Evaluation installs and one Developmental\/Operational Test aircraft install.  The fourth development kit will be refurbished and utilized as a production install via procurement funding.   Procurement funding will purchase the remaining 16 kits\/installs for a total of 20 aircraft.  Modification of the training system will be accomplished at the operational base and other locations as required.  This effort also includes updating the aircrew and maintenance trainers and academics\/courseware.  The Production and Deployment phase acquisition strategy is based on a two lot buy:  Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in FY2012 and Full Rate Production (FRP) in FY2013.   Funds on the Support Equipment line are for upgrades to related support equipment.\n\nEHF Increment 2 was deferred in the FY13 President's Budget.  The Air Force will pursue an alternative strategic communications method, the Common Very Low Frequency Receiver, to satisfy the immediate user need date.  However, secure, survivable two-way communication remains a requirement for the warfighter.\n \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate\nproduction and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LCC Block Upgrades, ASU, and UHF Receiver. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.\n\nMM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete\/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities and to conduct MM III Force Development Evaluations (FDEs) determining ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Current efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as the MMIWRP, MMODS and Ground Test Upgrades.  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  Baseline support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.\n\nMM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete\/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment.  Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as RFSE, CSM, STACS, TERP and RSERP.\n\nMM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities of remote key\/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring.  These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities and 45 Launch Control Centers.\n\nMM Operational Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of weapon system equipment including the Guidance Modernization effort and SRM Modernization effort.  Beginning in FY15, the Guidance Modernization effort will provide modifcations or replacements for the current MM III guidance subsystem necessary to ensure operations through 2030 and to support future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) requirements.  Beginning in FY15, the SRM Modernization effort will provide modifcations or replacements for the current MM III propulsion subsystem necessary to ensure operations through 2030 and to support future GBSD requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years."

This effort is not a new start in FY15.  Reflected in PE 0604851F ICBM - EMD, Project 655037, Support Equipment in FY14."

To enable completion of these missions, USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as Strategic War Planning System (SWPS)) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning\/Missile Defense (MW\/MD) data into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   \n\nThe nation's strategic Command and Control (C2), sensors and other planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW\/MD systems into a single IP-based system that will provide redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors, from tactical to strategic (including the Nation's most modern and capable assets) taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2. To enable these missions, the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) must be capable of both deliberate and adaptive planning employing the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).\n\nThe ISPAN modernization program includes initiation of Course of Action (COA) Development as a service to the DoD enterprise, workflow and decision support development, Combatant Commander (COCOM) Collaboration, User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP), conventional mission planning integration, and Mission Planning Analysis System (MPAS) maintenance and modernization. This includes software coding, integration of multiple internal and external planning applications, as well as developmental and early operational test activities. ISPAN also includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), software, facilities support, manpower, and training to support the mission objectives of ISPAN, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, and subsidiary systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nISPAN Increment 2 developed the next increment of planning tools for ISPAN Collaborative Information Environment (CIE).  It built on capabilities delivered during Block 1 and developed advanced decision support capabilities for senior leader situational awareness through enhanced data analysis and visualization. ISPAN Increment 4 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS), that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 4 will fulfill MPAS requirements by reducing Crisis Action Planning and Time Sensitive Planning timelines, integrating nuclear and conventional kinetic weapon capabilities with non-kinetic effects, providing the capability to integrate planning and analysis capabilities of future Global Strike weapons, updating the MPAS system to provide the ability to train users in significantly less time, and leveraging new technologies to lower sustainment costs.  ISPAN Inc 4 is an evolution of the Block 1 baseline system using proven technologies."

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2, the CJCS Plan ORD and the USSTRATCOM Plan ORD.  GSIN nets together selected systems and sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will enable a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2, improved senior leader situational awareness (SA), and decision-making.\n\nThe Nation's strategic C2, sensors and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning\/Missile Defense (MW\/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN enables existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning."

This multi-input single integrated air control picture enhances the North American Aerospace Defense\/Combatant Commander's (NORAD\/CC's) capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty, transition, and conventional warfare in the event of aggression toward the North American continent (including Hawaii).  The BCS-F system serves as the Air Force's Homeland Defense battle management, command, and control hub and integrates data from radar sensors, data links, and the supporting communications architecture.  It provides the tactical communications and data link capabilities that enable planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space (including the National Capital Region).  BCS-F is a bi-national cooperative program with Canada, ensuring air defense and surveillance capability for the entire North American continent (including Hawaii).  BCS-F achieved Initial Operational Capability in October 2006 and full deployment declaration in Nov 2012. \n\nNCR-IADS is the post-September 11, 2001, quickly established, ground based air defense system using sensors to enhance the air surveillance picture and is incorporated into BCS-F. \n\nBattle Control System Modernization\/Sustainment: The BCS M\/S program efforts include, but are not limited to, providing system changes to facilitate mission area changes such as Radiant Mercury (RM) Redundancy, Sensor Integration, Battle Control Center (BCC) Expansion, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Remote Tactical Air Picture (RTAP) extensibility. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and program execution, as well as future program planning.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This multi-input single integrated air control picture enhances the North American Aerospace Defense\/Combatant Commander's (NORAD\/CC's) capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty, transition, and conventional warfare in the event of aggression toward the North American continent (including Hawaii).  The BCS-F system serves as the Air Force's Homeland Defense battle management, command, and control hub and integrates data from radar sensors, data links, and the supporting communications architecture.  It provides the tactical communications and data link capabilities that enable planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space (including the National Capital Region).  BCS-F is a bi-national cooperative program with Canada, ensuring air defense and surveillance capability for the entire North American continent (including Hawaii).  BCS-F achieved Initial Operational Capability in October 2006 and full deployment declaration in Nov 2012. \n\nNCR-IADS is the post-September 11, 2001, quickly established, ground based air defense system using sensors to enhance the air surveillance picture and is incorporated into BCS-F. \n\nBattle Control System Modernization\/Sustainment: The BCS M\/S program efforts include, but are not limited to, providing system changes to facilitate mission area changes such as Radiant Mercury (RM) Redundancy, Sensor Integration, Battle Control Center (BCC) Expansion, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Remote Tactical Air Picture (RTAP) extensibility. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and program execution, as well as future program planning.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

POFAs use Combatant Command assets employed against representative threats of specific OPLANs, CONPLANs and\nDefense Planning Scenarios to determine the impact of and\/or mitigation measures required to operate in an Anti-Access\/Area-Denial (A2\/AD) Contested PNT Environment. JNWC leverages the $3M\/year POFAs to\ndevelop national-level NAVWAR guidance, develop joint Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), non-material solutions and to upgrade capabilities. The intent of POFAs is to provide timely information for nearterm\nTTP development and realistic training in degraded space support environments.

                            "val": "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with \"PNT Superiority.\"  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied \/ degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning.  Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access \/ area denial (A2\/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied \/ degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):\n\n1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.\n2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. \n3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.\n4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):\n\n1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository\n2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term\n3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with \"PNT Superiority.\"  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied \/ degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning.  Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access \/ area denial (A2\/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied \/ degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):\n\n1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.\n2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. \n3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.\n4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):\n\n1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository\n2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term\n3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This process is expected to shorten the project decision\/initiation time by 2-5 years for selected projects due to the integrated headquarters review and immediate availability of transition funding.  The WRAP process allows the Air Force the flexibility to accelerate the development and fielding of operational  initiatives resulting from innovation and transition them to the warfighter in a manner that coincides with Air Forces' development of the President's Budget. Candidate projects will compete for WRAP approval and funds based on business case analyses, actual or potential operational impacts, cost savings, project development, production, lifecycle costs, and project risk.  The Air Force, through appropriate program offices, will manage the acquisition and development process for the integration and fielding of WRAP-approved projects.  Each project will have a complete acquisition plan defined and approved as a criterion for project selection and subsequent funding.  Each sponsoring Major Command\/Agency must commit full project funding in the subsequent programming cycle.  Congress will be notified when all projects have been approved by the end of the current fiscal year via Congressional Notification Letters.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This process is expected to shorten the project decision\/initiation time by 2-5 years for selected projects due to the integrated headquarters review and immediate availability of transition funding.  The WRAP process allows the Air Force the flexibility to accelerate the development and fielding of operational  initiatives resulting from innovation and transition them to the warfighter in a manner that coincides with Air Forces' development of the President's Budget. Candidate projects will compete for WRAP approval and funds based on business case analyses, actual or potential operational impacts, cost savings, project development, production, lifecycle costs, and project risk.  The Air Force, through appropriate program offices, will manage the acquisition and development process for the integration and fielding of WRAP-approved projects.  Each project will have a complete acquisition plan defined and approved as a criterion for project selection and subsequent funding.  Each sponsoring Major Command\/Agency must commit full project funding in the subsequent programming cycle.  Congress will be notified when all projects have been approved by the end of the current fiscal year via Congressional Notification Letters.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  \n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical, emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar, Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensors to find, fix, and track ground targets using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC), high definition EO\/IR, metric sensor and other capabilities, and assesses post-strike results.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop field capability through incremental upgrades.  Future capabilities development activity includes airframe and airframe system improvements such as: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability of the aircraft from 10,500 to 11,700lbs; increasing the operational range and endurance of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft (adding external fuel tanks and\/or airframe modifications such as wing extensions); incorporating an anti-ice\/de-ice capability to transit light icing conditions (will involve wing\/tail modifications as well as turbine inlet heating); propulsion system improvements; enhancing MQ-9 systems to include Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC); integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption, IP networking, and Beyond Line-of-Sight comm upgrades; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials; secure voice and data communications, including SATCOM upgrades; sensor\/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature Munitions\/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile, GBU-12\/38\/49 guided bombs, and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) variants); hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapon system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.  The MQ-9 program will continue to support other payload and capability development activities funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) leveraging Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), Dismount Detection Radar (DDR), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons) and address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.\n   \nThe GCS, common with the MQ-1 Predator, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provides a means for manual control; allows personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions.  Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS.  GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance\/certification and accreditation requirements.  Key efforts include GCS upgrades that add new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, ergonomic improvements, improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, and improved crew habitability. In addition, the GCS upgrade effort also includes development\/integration of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight in the GCS. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standard and tools.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, a ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data\/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system.  The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  \n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical, emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar, Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensors to find, fix, and track ground targets using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC), high definition EO\/IR, metric sensor and other capabilities, and assesses post-strike results.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop field capability through incremental upgrades.  Future capabilities development activity includes airframe and airframe system improvements such as: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability of the aircraft from 10,500 to 11,700lbs; increasing the operational range and endurance of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft (adding external fuel tanks and\/or airframe modifications such as wing extensions); incorporating an anti-ice\/de-ice capability to transit light icing conditions (will involve wing\/tail modifications as well as turbine inlet heating); propulsion system improvements; enhancing MQ-9 systems to include Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC); integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption, IP networking, and Beyond Line-of-Sight comm upgrades; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials; secure voice and data communications, including SATCOM upgrades; sensor\/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature Munitions\/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile, GBU-12\/38\/49 guided bombs, and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) variants); hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapon system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.  The MQ-9 program will continue to support other payload and capability development activities funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) leveraging Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), Dismount Detection Radar (DDR), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons) and address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.\n   \nThe GCS, common with the MQ-1 Predator, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provides a means for manual control; allows personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions.  Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS.  GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance\/certification and accreditation requirements.  Key efforts include GCS upgrades that add new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, ergonomic improvements, improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, and improved crew habitability. In addition, the GCS upgrade effort also includes development\/integration of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight in the GCS. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standard and tools.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Specifically, this program provides procurement, research and development, and operations and maintenance for sustaining the ALQ-131 and ALQ-184 EA jamming pods.  These pods are the sole self-protection jamming systems for US Air Force A-10 aircraft and most models of the F-16 aircraft.  This upgrade to the electronic attack pod is necessary to keep pace with adversary technological advances in surface-to-air and air-to-air missile systems.  Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) allows an electronic system to digitally record and store characteristics of received signals in order to produce a jamming pulse that more precisely replicates the threat systems pulse.  With the current\/near term threat systems the A-10 and F-16 are likely to encounter, this level of fidelity is necessary to effectively protect these aircraft in this increasingly lethal environment.  \n\nThis PE is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports upgrade development of the A-10 and F-16 EA pods which are fielded systems."

Specifically, this program provides procurement, research and development, and operations and maintenance for sustaining the ALQ-131 and ALQ-184 EA jamming pods.  These pods are the sole self-protection jamming systems for US Air Force A-10 aircraft and most models of the F-16 aircraft.  This upgrade to the electronic attack pod is necessary to keep pace with adversary technological advances in surface-to-air and air-to-air missile systems.  Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) allows an electronic system to digitally record and store characteristics of received signals in order to produce a jamming pulse that more precisely replicates the threat systems pulse.  With the current\/near term threat systems the A-10 and F-16 are likely to encounter, this level of fidelity is necessary to effectively protect these aircraft in this increasingly lethal environment.  \n\nThis PE is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports upgrade development of the A-10 and F-16 EA pods which are fielded systems."

The A-10 concept of operations requires a flexible, adaptable and survivable weapon system providing close-air support, combat search and rescue, and special operations capabilities. Current high operational tempo experienced by the Expeditionary Air Force requires the A-10 to perform effectively in a variety of operational roles. The A-10 must conduct around-the-clock air operations under various weather conditions against numerous enemy threats employing a full spectrum of air defense systems. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

There have been further delays due to the decision to defer Suite 8 in Jan 14 and then the decision to restart Suite 8 in Feb 14. \n\nEfforts include the development of a SIL in support of the transition to organic software development.  A SIL that can support the Suite 8 baseline will be developed for organic use. This SIL will consist of one Integrated Test Stand (ITS). The work continuing on the SIL will allow it to be operational by Oct 14. The work to get the SIL operational will consist of writing the COMET code to run the SIL, constructing it and writing the test procedures against it. If the SIL is not completed the OFP will not be able to correct and fix deficiencies that arise thus causing a grounding of the fleet.  This SIL will have no Sub System Test (SST) stands. With no SST's, and only one ITS, this will not allow for development actions, only sustainment."

                            "val": "The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier multi-mission fighter.  It is a fixed-wing, high performance, single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 35-year history, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day\/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)\/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD\/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved in its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales (FMS) production continues in the 21st century.  AFLCMC\/WWM (the F-16 System Program Office) develops, integrates, and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements that are being or will be developed during the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) include:  \n\na. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Block 40\/42\/50\/52 OFPs (M-series tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, and hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to keep the F-16s, their respective training simulators, and other hardware Group B subsystems current.  To keep this legacy platform combat capable, OFPs are designed for release on a three-year cycle.  Generally, three major or minor tapes are under development\/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-series tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM, Laser JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB and SDB II), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D, Sidewinder (AIM-9X\/AIM-9X Block II), and updates to existing weapons.  Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration, developing and integrating advanced racks, pylons, adapters, and the universal armament interface (UAI), and ensuring continued nuclear surety, safety and compatibility with upgrades such as the integration of the B61-12.  Updates to electronic warfare systems allow for incorporation of the latest updates for changing threat environment, reducing war-fighter vulnerabilities.  Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) HW block upgrades provides the F-16s with a secure, jam resistant, high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft, airborne control aircraft, and ground control centers. The new major capabilities currently being integrated via M6.5\/M7+ include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS\/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security, AIM-120D, joint mission planning system (JMPS).  As part of the Source of Repair Assignment Process (SORAP) decision, the OFP development has transitioned from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) to Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC), 309th Software Maintenance Group (309 SMXG). LM Aero will produce the common USAF\/European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) core software tape for USAF M6.5+ that will serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP. The 309 SMXG has software development responsibility for the M7+ SW\/HW candidates for the USAF jets fielding in FY16.  M7.2+ Minor Tape is currently in early stages of program planning, candidate definition and test HW procurement to incorporate DoD mandates such as Airborne Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS B-Out) as well as other Combat Air Forces (CAF) candidates including color display and Advanced Defensive Electronic Warfare (EW) System coordination.  M8+ is in early stages of program planning for incorporating Modular Mission Computer (MMC) architecture. \n\n \nb. F-16 Block 40-52 Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP): A two-phased RDT&E effort which includes Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to Block 40\/42\/50\/52 F-16 aircraft to increase service life.  FSDT required preliminary structural analysis, construction of a test fixture, and modification of an aircraft to begin testing. FSDT is required to prove finite element models and to develop the airworthiness certification basis to extend the current Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective).  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and MIL-STD 1530C, testing will support Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage, maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8,000 hours.  EMD is required to develop the engineering solutions necessary to resolve the life-limiting structural issues defined in FSDT and develop the airworthiness certification recommendation. The Government will receive a re-procurement technical data package to support production of kits and installs, maintenance Technical Orders, Time Compliance Technical Orders, manufacturing and installation tools, and all drawing packages necessary to sustain the SLEP modified aircraft through the extended certified service life.  \n\nc. Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS):  Builds upon the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) fighter risk reduction program (FRRP) demonstrated capability and results in the Auto GCAS capability being production ready for incorporation in the M6.2+ OFP (Minor Tape) fielding in FY14 with potential for nearly eliminating controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilots and aircraft.    \n\nd. EMD Hardware\/Advanced Capability Improvements:  EMD HW provides funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence.  The approach to contracting varies by individual project.  These hardware improvements include but are not limited to flight systems, improved navigation, multiplex architecture, MMC advanced hi-speed digital data communication and throughput and memory upgrades within the aircraft systems. Updates are periodically made to improve performance of subsystems such as embedded GPS inertial navigation set (EGI), air-to-air interrogator (AAI), digital video recorder, advanced data transfer equipment (ADTE) and related data transfer and retrieval devices, displays and display generators, radio\/communication gear, and data link improvements.  Advanced capability improvements include software integration, sensor upgrades, radar updates and other self-protection\/electronic protection (EP) enhancements, 4th\/5th gen fighter network communications, lab and\/or on-aircraft evaluation of potential subsystem changes\/capability improvements.  These capability improvements also include integration of targeting pod updates and tech order changes  e.g., SNIPER targeting pod, High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) targeting system (HTS), low altitude infrared targeting and navigation LITENING tageting pod, etc.  Advanced capabilities also include integration of new replacement hardware for DMS crash survivable data recorder. \n\ne. Modular Mission Computer (MMC) \/ Display Generator Upgrade:  The MMC upgrade resolves short falls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability over the last three OFP cycles.  Funding includes non-recurring engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground\/flight test for fielding with the M8+ OFP.  The addition of an Ethernet port facilitates future increments of combat capability (e.g., digital targeting pod video).  The Display Generator Upgrade allows a fully integrated Multi-Function Display System (MFDS) solution including Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) integration with Sensors of Interest (SOI), format swapping and high definition video on 4\"x4\" displays; provides improved display formats during dynamic maneuvers; resolves symbol freezing issues due to throughput constraints; and provides a sustainable approach to address growing DMS concerns with the current Programmable Display Processor (PDG).\n\nf. F-16 Training Simulators:  The F-16 simulators enable the USAF to exercise and train using the latest available F-16 Fighting Falcon capabilities available to all block configurations, while reducing the overall cost of training the Armed Forces, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers.  In order to maintain concurrency with the aircraft OFP, this funding supports development, test, and integration of simulator upgrade efforts, such as OFP development.  Reductions in unit flying hour programs through the FYDP increase the need for high fidelity combat crew training devices that are capable of simulating the full range of anticipated combat and combat support missions.  \n\ng. The JASSM-ER (Extended Range):  This capability integrates JASSM-ER on F-16 Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and test.  This capability will be fielded in conjunction with a future OFP delivery.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier multi-mission fighter.  It is a fixed-wing, high performance, single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 35-year history, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day\/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)\/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD\/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved in its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales (FMS) production continues in the 21st century.  AFLCMC\/WWM (the F-16 System Program Office) develops, integrates, and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements that are being or will be developed during the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) include:  \n\na. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Block 40\/42\/50\/52 OFPs (M-series tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, and hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to keep the F-16s, their respective training simulators, and other hardware Group B subsystems current.  To keep this legacy platform combat capable, OFPs are designed for release on a three-year cycle.  Generally, three major or minor tapes are under development\/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-series tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM, Laser JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB and SDB II), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D, Sidewinder (AIM-9X\/AIM-9X Block II), and updates to existing weapons.  Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration, developing and integrating advanced racks, pylons, adapters, and the universal armament interface (UAI), and ensuring continued nuclear surety, safety and compatibility with upgrades such as the integration of the B61-12.  Updates to electronic warfare systems allow for incorporation of the latest updates for changing threat environment, reducing war-fighter vulnerabilities.  Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) HW block upgrades provides the F-16s with a secure, jam resistant, high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft, airborne control aircraft, and ground control centers. The new major capabilities currently being integrated via M6.5\/M7+ include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS\/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security, AIM-120D, joint mission planning system (JMPS).  As part of the Source of Repair Assignment Process (SORAP) decision, the OFP development has transitioned from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) to Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC), 309th Software Maintenance Group (309 SMXG). LM Aero will produce the common USAF\/European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) core software tape for USAF M6.5+ that will serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP. The 309 SMXG has software development responsibility for the M7+ SW\/HW candidates for the USAF jets fielding in FY16.  M7.2+ Minor Tape is currently in early stages of program planning, candidate definition and test HW procurement to incorporate DoD mandates such as Airborne Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS B-Out) as well as other Combat Air Forces (CAF) candidates including color display and Advanced Defensive Electronic Warfare (EW) System coordination.  M8+ is in early stages of program planning for incorporating Modular Mission Computer (MMC) architecture. \n\n \nb. F-16 Block 40-52 Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP): A two-phased RDT&E effort which includes Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to Block 40\/42\/50\/52 F-16 aircraft to increase service life.  FSDT required preliminary structural analysis, construction of a test fixture, and modification of an aircraft to begin testing. FSDT is required to prove finite element models and to develop the airworthiness certification basis to extend the current Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective).  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and MIL-STD 1530C, testing will support Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage, maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8,000 hours.  EMD is required to develop the engineering solutions necessary to resolve the life-limiting structural issues defined in FSDT and develop the airworthiness certification recommendation. The Government will receive a re-procurement technical data package to support production of kits and installs, maintenance Technical Orders, Time Compliance Technical Orders, manufacturing and installation tools, and all drawing packages necessary to sustain the SLEP modified aircraft through the extended certified service life.  \n\nc. Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS):  Builds upon the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) fighter risk reduction program (FRRP) demonstrated capability and results in the Auto GCAS capability being production ready for incorporation in the M6.2+ OFP (Minor Tape) fielding in FY14 with potential for nearly eliminating controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilots and aircraft.    \n\nd. EMD Hardware\/Advanced Capability Improvements:  EMD HW provides funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence.  The approach to contracting varies by individual project.  These hardware improvements include but are not limited to flight systems, improved navigation, multiplex architecture, MMC advanced hi-speed digital data communication and throughput and memory upgrades within the aircraft systems. Updates are periodically made to improve performance of subsystems such as embedded GPS inertial navigation set (EGI), air-to-air interrogator (AAI), digital video recorder, advanced data transfer equipment (ADTE) and related data transfer and retrieval devices, displays and display generators, radio\/communication gear, and data link improvements.  Advanced capability improvements include software integration, sensor upgrades, radar updates and other self-protection\/electronic protection (EP) enhancements, 4th\/5th gen fighter network communications, lab and\/or on-aircraft evaluation of potential subsystem changes\/capability improvements.  These capability improvements also include integration of targeting pod updates and tech order changes  e.g., SNIPER targeting pod, High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) targeting system (HTS), low altitude infrared targeting and navigation LITENING tageting pod, etc.  Advanced capabilities also include integration of new replacement hardware for DMS crash survivable data recorder. \n\ne. Modular Mission Computer (MMC) \/ Display Generator Upgrade:  The MMC upgrade resolves short falls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability over the last three OFP cycles.  Funding includes non-recurring engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground\/flight test for fielding with the M8+ OFP.  The addition of an Ethernet port facilitates future increments of combat capability (e.g., digital targeting pod video).  The Display Generator Upgrade allows a fully integrated Multi-Function Display System (MFDS) solution including Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) integration with Sensors of Interest (SOI), format swapping and high definition video on 4\"x4\" displays; provides improved display formats during dynamic maneuvers; resolves symbol freezing issues due to throughput constraints; and provides a sustainable approach to address growing DMS concerns with the current Programmable Display Processor (PDG).\n\nf. F-16 Training Simulators:  The F-16 simulators enable the USAF to exercise and train using the latest available F-16 Fighting Falcon capabilities available to all block configurations, while reducing the overall cost of training the Armed Forces, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers.  In order to maintain concurrency with the aircraft OFP, this funding supports development, test, and integration of simulator upgrade efforts, such as OFP development.  Reductions in unit flying hour programs through the FYDP increase the need for high fidelity combat crew training devices that are capable of simulating the full range of anticipated combat and combat support missions.  \n\ng. The JASSM-ER (Extended Range):  This capability integrates JASSM-ER on F-16 Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and test.  This capability will be fielded in conjunction with a future OFP delivery.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

FSDT required preliminary structural analysis, construction of a test fixture, and modification of an aircraft to begin testing. The FSDT contract awarded Apr 11 and aircraft cycle testing began Dec 12. FSDT is required to prove finite element models and to develop the airworthiness certification basis to extend the current Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective).  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and MIL-STD 1530C, testing will support Blk 40-52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage, maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8,000 hours.  FSDT is projected to complete cycle testing in Nov 14, with final recommendation in Nov 15.  The Government will receive a re-procurement technical data package to support production and installs, maintenance Technical Orders, Time Compliance Technical Orders, manufacturing and installation tools, and all drawing packages necessary to sustain the SLEP modified aircraft through the extended certified service life.  Production contract is planned to award in FY17, with FRP in FY19."

Production configurations of the remaining software items will be incorporated during the M6.2+ effort that will field in FY14, which will enable the Auto GCAS function."

The F-15C\/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night\/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2035, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Head Up Display (HUD), instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  Funds are also used, as required, to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated \"double-digit\" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe.  These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15.  Incorporation of corresponding spiral and\/or phased technology\/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training.\n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This AESA radar has the ability to provide electronic attack and protection capabilities.  \n\nThe ADCP II will develop a common mission computer for the F-15C\/D and F-15E.  The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements.  A common mission computer is expected to reduce overall development costs as well as long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C\/D cockpit display to replace an obsolete one.\n\nEPAWSS will replace the obsolete Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS), which will help the aircraft survive in high threat environments.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The development of F-15 EP will maximize Key System Attributes (KSA) and EP techniques for F-15E Radar Modernization Program (RMP) in Suite 8E; ensure remaining KSAs and EP techniques for F-15E RMP are included in Suite 9; ensure legacy EP for F-15C APG-63(v)3, commensurate with the APG-63(v)1 radar legacy EP capability, is included in Suite 9; and maximize additional advanced EP for F-15C APG-63(v)3 in Suite 9.\"  \n\nFor the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 3 years.  At any one time the program has three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition\/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort.  \n\nInfrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C\/D in a radar-denied environment.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

IRST will provide the F-15Cs with the capability to counter Low Observerable technology outside the RF spectrum, and will provide capability in an RF jamming environment. The IRST complements other onboard sensors by scanning a large volume of air space, fills gaps left by other sensors, and is unaffected by electronic attack, target emissions, beam aspect, or target radar cross section (RCS). This capability complements the radar to enhance survivability and lethality against air-to-air threats, provides a passive infrared sensor system that searches for and detects infrared energy, and provides the aircraft mission computer track file data on infrared targets."

The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50\/52 and Block 40\/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN\/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN\/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN\/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50\/52 and Block 40\/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN\/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN\/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN\/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The REDI contract allows the issuance of orders for the highest priority war fighter capabilities in operationally meaningful capability increments, requirements analysis, contractor cost estimates and studies, development and demonstration of capability enhancements, and unanticipated future war fighter requirements. Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort. The (REDI) II contract is a follow-on Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity contract to the initial REDI contract. REDI II provides maximum flexibility to manage various modernization projects. The REDI II contract allows for the issuance of orders for efforts associated with the planning, analysis, design, development, qualification, test and documentation of F-22 weapon system performance enhancements, life-cycle improvements, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, and associated efforts essential to accomplishing the F-22 mission."

The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Carrier Variant (CV).  Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize life cycle costs.  FY2015 continues development and testing of the F-35.  As the initial capabilities are being delivered from the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program, planning for Follow-on Development (FoD) continues.  Capability requirements are being matured and FoD planning continues based upon the approved Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), an approved Electronic Warfare ICD, and the results of an OSD Tiger Team Review.   FY14 F-35 FoD activity supports development of Follow-on Development Increment 1 Capability Development Document (CDD).  Follow-on Development will provide capability enhancements, required systems upgrades and cost improvements through an incremental acquisition approach.  \n\nAdditionally, the F-35 JSF ORD calls for the F-35A (CTOL) Variant Air Vehicle to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons.  DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.  Due to extensive certification  requirements, the DCA capability  planning and design will begin in Block 4A and continue through testing and certification in Block 4B.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Carrier Variant (CV).  Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize life cycle costs.  FY2015 continues development and testing of the F-35.  As the initial capabilities are being delivered from the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program, planning for Follow-on Development (FoD) continues.  Capability requirements are being matured and FoD planning continues based upon the approved Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), an approved Electronic Warfare ICD, and the results of an OSD Tiger Team Review.   FY14 F-35 FoD activity includes drafting of Follow-on Development Increment 1 Capability Development Document (CDD) and further risk reduction.  Follow-on Development will provide capability enhancements, required systems upgrades and cost improvements through an incremental acquisition approach.  \n\nAdditionally, the JSF ORD calls for the F-35A (CTOL) Variant Air Vehicle to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons.  DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.  Due to extensive certification  requirements, the DCA capability  planning and design will begin in Block 4A and continue through testing and certification in Block 4B.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The AIM-9X missile program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive infrared (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).  Air superiority in the short range air-to-air missile arena is essential and includes first-shot, first-kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures.  The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuse, rocket motor, and warhead).  Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  \n\nAIM-9X is a Post Milestone III, Acquisition Category 1C (ACAT 1C) joint-service program with Navy lead.  AIM-9X Block I concluded in FY 2011 and all funding\/quantity data in the documents are associated with Block II activities.\n\nThis budget line item will fund the development, test and integration of software updates to the missile, insensitive munitions improvements and aircraft platform integration, to ensure these capabilities perform in accordance with established requirements.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Air superiority in the short range air-to-air missile arena is essential and includes first-shot, first-kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures.  The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuse, rocket motor, and warhead).  Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  \n\nAIM-9X is a Post Milestone III, Acquisition Category 1C (ACAT 1C) joint-service program with Navy lead.  AIM-9X Block I concluded in FY 2011 and all funding\/quantity data in the documents are associated with Block II activities.\n\nThis budget line item will fund the development, test and integration of software updates to the missile, insensitive munitions improvements and aircraft platform integration, to ensure these capabilities perform in accordance with established requirements.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The development program also enables AMRAAM to be compatible with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities and investigates new variants and\/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation, a two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility, and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness. The AIM-120D Operational Test Readiness Review was successfully completed in May 2012 and the program is in dedicated Operational Testing (OT).  The aircraft integration program maintains compatibility\/performance of the missile with changes occurring on the F\/A-18E\/F, F-15C\/D\/E, F-16, F-22A, and F-18 C\/D platforms.  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and\/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force\/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The development program also enables AMRAAM to be compatible with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities and investigates new variants and\/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation, a two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility, and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness. The AIM-120D Operational Test Readiness Review was successfully completed in May 2012 and the program is in dedicated Operational Testing (OT).  The aircraft integration program maintains compatibility\/performance of the missile with changes occurring on the F\/A-18E\/F, F-15C\/D\/E, F-16, F-22A, and F-18 C\/D platforms.  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and\/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force\/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Post-OT missile improvements are underway as part of the AIM-120D upgrade program.  The System Improvement Program, Increment 1 (SIP-1) has begun and is expected to field in early FY15.  Additional SIP increments are in the planning phase and will further improve the AIM-120D to meet emerging warfighter requirements.\n\nThe Electronic Protection Improvement Program (EPIP) is also underway, with the initial capabilities currently in flight testing.  EPIP Basic capabilities will field in FY14.  The EPIP effort will keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment.

Program is in Full Rate Production (FRP).  Continuing activities include deficiency resolution; improvements to tooling and test equipment; Electronic Unit (EU) obsolescence\/Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) redesign; a systems engineering approach for implementing alternate displays; software updates; platform integration; improvements to Reliability and Maintainability (R&M); system upgrade studies and analysis; other obsolescence upgrades; improved magnetic mapping processes to reduce maintenance manhours\/life cycle costs; and efforts to support the transition to depot activation.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night \/ under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2035, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors). The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft, sophisticated \"double-digit\" anti-aircraft missile systems and other enemy systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. The F-15 Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) will replace the F-15's functionally obsolete self-defense Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) to enhance weapon system situational awareness and survivability against enemy threats. F-15 EPAWSS will also improve reliability and sustainability. F-15 EPAWSS is linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and \/ or phased technology \/ equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability and aircrew training.\n\nThe F-15 EPAWSS upgrade will significantly improve the F-15's capability to autonomously and automatically detect, identify and locate radio frequency (RF) threats as well as provide the ability to deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt and defeat RF and electro-optical \/ infrared (EO \/ IR) threat systems in contested and unplanned operations within highly contested environments through 2035. The F-15 EPAWSS will provide indication, type and position of ground-based RF threats as well as the indication, type and bearing of airborne threats with the situational awareness needed to avoid, engage or negate the threat. The F-15 EPAWSS will prevent RF and IR threat systems from detecting or acquiring accurate targeting information prior to threat engagement to complicate and \/ or negate an enemy threat targeting solution--and effectively counter enemy missiles \/ weapons if adversary threat systems engage and employ weapons against friendly forces--through components such as chaff, flares, decoys \/ angle countermeasures and jamming.    \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The F-15C continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night \/ under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2035, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors). The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft, sophisticated \"double-digit\" anti-aircraft missile systems and other enemy systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. The F-15 Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) will replace the F-15's functionally obsolete self-defense Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) to enhance weapon system situational awareness and survivability against enemy threats. F-15 EPAWSS will also improve reliability and sustainability. F-15 EPAWSS is linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and \/ or phased technology \/ equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability and aircrew training.\n\nThe F-15 EPAWSS upgrade will significantly improve the F-15's capability to autonomously and automatically detect, identify and locate radio frequency (RF) threats as well as provide the ability to deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt and defeat RF and electro-optical \/ infrared (EO \/ IR) threat systems in contested and unplanned operations within highly contested environments through 2035. The F-15 EPAWSS will provide indication, type and position of ground-based RF threats as well as the indication, type and bearing of airborne threats with the situational awareness needed to avoid, engage or negate the threat. The F-15 EPAWSS will prevent RF and IR threat systems from detecting or acquiring accurate targeting information prior to threat engagement to complicate and \/ or negate an enemy threat targeting solution--and effectively counter enemy missiles \/ weapons if adversary threat systems engage and employ weapons against friendly forces--through components such as chaff, flares, decoys \/ angle countermeasures and jamming.    \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing\/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.\n\nFunds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  SONAR, Maritime Recovery, Technical Recovery, Integrated Oxygen System, Medical Monitoring, and the Guardian Angel Air Operations Kit.  The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing\/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.\n\nFunds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  SONAR, Maritime Recovery, Technical Recovery, Integrated Oxygen System, Medical Monitoring, and the Guardian Angel Air Operations Kit.  The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The U.S. government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by Air Force TENCAP.\n\nTENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program team to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue to the following segment which enables mitigation of cost and schedule risk.\n\nContracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible."

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The employment of this system interdicts our adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the Baseline 2 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  \n\nThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), new modern communications receiver technologies, new IR and counter radar technologies, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (glass cockpits), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new\/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY 2015 is required to support RDT&E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet and ground systems\/simulators.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the coming years.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  The two Compass Call Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST), scheduled to deliver in 2nd Quarter FY 2014, will mirror the capabilities of the fielded aircraft as well.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  \n\nDue to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The employment of this system interdicts our adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the Baseline 2 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  \n\nThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), new modern communications receiver technologies, new IR and counter radar technologies, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (glass cockpits), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new\/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY 2015 is required to support RDT&E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet and ground systems\/simulators.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the coming years.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST), scheduled to deliver in 2nd Quarter FY 2014, will mirror the capabilities of the fielded aircraft as well.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  \n\nDue to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types\/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage\/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives. New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types\/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational. Engine CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage\/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines. Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs. Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force propulsion systems.  Engine CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability & Maintainability (R&M), to reduce propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain the propulsion systems throughout the service life.  Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and type\/maturity of the propulsion systems, not by the total quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory propulsion systems operational.  Engine CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage\/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production propulsion systems.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&M and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

There are two variants of the JASSM missile; JASSM baseline and JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER). The requirement for JASSM baseline is given in the JASSM Operational Requirements Document (ORD) dated 20 Jan 2004, and the JASSM-ER requirement is given in JASSM-ER Capability Development Document (CDD) dated 16 Apr 2010. Both JASSM missiles have improved reliability, separate milestone decision points and separate projects within a single program element. Aircraft integration of baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2 and F-15E.  Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40) and F-35.  Aircraft integration of JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1B. Objective aircraft are the B-52H, F16C\/D (Block 50\/52), B-2, F-16C\/D (Blocks 25-42), F-15E and F-35.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This project develops the baseline JASSM missile.  The requirement for JASSM baseline is given in the JASSM Operational Requirements Document (ORD), dated 20 Jan 2004.  Aircraft integration of the baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, B-2, and F-15E.  Objective aircraft include the F-16 (Block 40)and F-35.  The government is buying the JASSM system based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS), this SPS is on contract.  The contractor assumes total system performance responsibility (TSPR) for Lots 1-6 as defined in the SPS; for Lot 7 and beyond, the government has approval authority of Class I configuration changes. This project also develops improvements to the JASSM and JASSM-ER fuze, including the development of the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF). The Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) is partially executed under this project as it is common to JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. The program is evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and several obsolescence issues."

The requirement for JASSM-ER is given in JASSM-ER Capability Development Document (CDD), dated 16 Apr 2010.  This project develops the extended range version of the JASSM missile (JASSM-ER).  The threshold integration platform for JASSM-ER is the B-1B.  Objective aircraft are B-52H, F16C\/D (Block 50\/52), B-2, F-16C\/D (Blocks 25-42), F-15E, and F-35.  JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM Baseline while minimizing the threat to launch aircraft.  The Air Force is developing JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS).  The 16 JASSM-ER Operational Test flights were successfully completed in 2013 with a 100% success rate (16\/16).  Currently, this project develops a Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) which will be used during flight testing and will be common to both JASSM Baseline and JASSM-ER.  The Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF) is partially executed under this project since it's common to JASSM baseline and JASSM-ER. The JASSM program is evaluating Diminishing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and several obsolescence issues."

There are four funded projects within the AOC WS program element:\n\nIntegration Development supports the AOC WS, AN-USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  AOC WS is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined\/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C\/JFACC) for planning, executing and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  \n\nApplications Development provides worldwide operational level C2 capabilities, which include: air battle planning, management, and execution; operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD); as well as personnel recovery C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  \n\nUnit Level (UL) supports two primary mission areas: UL Operations software systems provide both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing and squadron level and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future Air Battle Planning to refine future missions.  UL intelligence capabilities ensure detailed threat, target and imagery information readily available to mission commanders and aircrews planning current flight operations. \n\nPersonnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2): Provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and situationally-appropriate personnel recovery command and control system which supports personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across the Range of Military Operation in the joint\/coalition operating environment.  The system collects, stores and delivers personnel\/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis\/assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The C\/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined\/Joint Forces Commander (C\/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C\/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces. \n\nThe AOC Integration Development program keeps the AOC interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the integration, testing and fielding of new capabilities and sustainment upgrades to the AOC WS baseline.  The program supports mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units.  To keep the AOC current and interoperable with the COCOMs, cyber requirements, and fifth generation weapon system\/weapons, the AOC WS program plans to evolve the AOC through the integration and test of progressively improving capabilities.  These activities ensure a system of systems engineering perspective for the AOC WS, and include weapon system standardization activities as defined by AOC WS requirements documents.  Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) establishes critical IAMD improvements in the AOC WS to maximize the allocation, planning, and execution of IAMD.  The Modernization contractor, which was awarded the Modernization contract on 25 October 2011, has commenced with AOC 10.2 pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities, including a Systems Requirements Review (SRR), an Interim Design Review (IDR), and a delta-Preliminary Design Review (delta-PDR).  In accordance with AOC 10.2 Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) direction (23 Jun 2010), the AOC 10.2 Modernization program conducted prototyping and Limited Early Install (LEI) activities through an iterative build methodology prior to Milestone B (MS B) to reduce integration risk and improve user feedback in the acquisition process.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nIn FY13, AOC 10.2 is PRCP Program Number (PNO) N42.  In\nFY14, AOC 10.2 is PNO N46.  Beginning in FY15, AOC 10.2 is PNO N91"

Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  These efforts focus on, but are not limited to, support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other C2 systems.  Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013).  Applications Development activities include but are not limited to the following: 1) Command and Control Air Operations Suite-Command and Control Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012).  C2AOS-C2IS I creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest (AO COI).  C2AOS-C2IS I also develops, matures, fields, and maintains modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions to include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); 2) Command and Control Air Operations Suite-Command and Control Information Services II (C2AOS-C2IS II) will focus on but not be limited to, the remainder of CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems-Force Level (TBMCS-FL) functionality not addressed in C2AOS-C2IS I as well as providing new C2 capabilities for planning and execution of 4th & 5th Generation Fighter Platforms, interoperability with other evolving Global Command & Control System Family of Systems (GCCS FoS) and other Service programs, and for Force Level data migration; and 3) Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program which develops and delivers tools and services for collaborating, planning and managing search and rescue efforts, and disseminating related information.  The Joint Personnel Recovery Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.\n\nCore activities for Applications Development include but are not limited to the following: 1) developing capabilities to support planning and replanning of the Air Battle Plan; generation and dissemination of the Air Tasking Order; defense planning and execution; targeting; weaponeering; personnel recovery tasks; other applications and services supporting C2 in the joint environment; 2) providing support to and participating in the Air Operations Community of Interest (AO COI) to improve air operations information interoperability among all joint and coalition systems within the Air Operations (AO) domain; 3) developing and assessing C2 air, space, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and cyber technologies that will improve joint and coalition warfighter interoperability, including participation in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition interoperability exercises, demonstrations, trials, and activities; 4) transitioning existing C2 capabilities to a net-centric environment; and 5) improving operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD).  Applications Development efforts include evaluation and maturation of future air, space, and cyber C2 concepts identified through research, risk reduction, prototyping, current operations, exercises, and demonstrations.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

PRC2 provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and timely situational awareness information for personnel recovery supporting personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across a broad spectrum of US government which may include in the joint\/coalition military and civilian rescue mission.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) ICD (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.\n\nThe system collects, stores and delivers personnel\/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities. The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning."

It is a tailorable, modular, transportable, sustainable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations.   The CRC projects include development of Theater Air Control Systems Improvement (TACSI) capabilities.  These efforts include, but are not limited to, the development and modification of the  AN\/TYQ-23 Operations Module (OM) and the AN\/TRC-215 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS).\n\nAN\/TYQ-23 OM is a low density\/high demand (LD\/HD) rapidly deployable ground-based C2 asset.  This automated, computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks.  AN\/TRC-215 RRSVS is a mobile, vehicle-mounted voice radio and OM-interface unit.  The RRSVS allows real-time, secure voice communication between aircraft operating in the battlespace and ground-based battle management C2 operators located in the OM of the CRC.   \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future development of open system architecture requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It is a tailorable, modular, transportable, sustainable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations.   The CRC projects include development of Theater Air Control Systems Improvement (TACSI) capabilities.  These efforts include, but are not limited to, the development and modification of the  AN\/TYQ-23 Operations Module (OM) and the AN\/TRC-215 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS).\n\nAN\/TYQ-23 OM is a low density\/high demand (LD\/HD) rapidly deployable ground-based C2 asset.  This automated, computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks.  AN\/TRC-215 RRSVS is a mobile, vehicle-mounted voice radio and OM-interface unit.  The RRSVS allows real-time, secure voice communication between aircraft operating in the battlespace and ground-based battle management C2 operators located in the OM of the CRC.   \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future development of open system architecture requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Mission: Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) is the premier airborne platform providing battle management (BM)\/command and control (C2) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude\/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.\n\n1. E-3 Block 40\/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40\/45 upgrade will improve integration, quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter, improve Combat Identification (CID), improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI), improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective, faster upgrades via an open-system, Ethernet-based architecture. This upgrade also updates the ground support infrastructure, training systems [(Mission Crew Training Set (MCTS), Mission Computing Maintenance Trainer (MCMT) and the Airborne Training Set (ATS)], data links and the Avionics Integration Support Facility (AISF) all located at Tinker Air Force Base.\n\n2. E-3 Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. The National Security Agency (NSA) declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14.  The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator, while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30\/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 capability on Block 40\/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the Block 30\/35 and Block 40\/45 platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S, a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware, as funding allows.\n\n3. E-3 DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA\/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\/EUROCONTROL (European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene Command and Control (C2) Battle Management (BM). The DRAGON modifications replace the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.\n\n4. E-3 Electronic Protection (EP): The EP program funds the development and retrofit of the E-3 AWACS radar processing capability including risk reduction and EMD activities.  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the operator screen in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  The program will buy COTS equipment starting in FY17 including initial spares.   \n\n5.  E-3 Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) provides continuing system engineering and management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure, AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS), support for equipment concurrency, modernization planning\/analysis, trainer\/simulator integration and concurrency, as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) and Advanced Development Lab #2 (ADL-2). The contractor maintained and operated E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab\/Software Development Facility (SIL\/SDF) provides US, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and international customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration to support radar development, production, and sustainment programs.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. TSI supports trainer\/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. The overall Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E) test infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment projects, and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA.  Funding is shared between Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and production funds.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) AEW&C efforts.\n\n6. E-3 Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR): C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system, or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of material solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as material solutions for the user needs.\n \n7. E-3 Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC): IPEC will provide the Block 40\/45 E-3 with a wideband communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations\/warfare.  The E-3 lacks an IP-enabled communication capability.  As a result, the E-3 is not able to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time sensitive targets.  IPEC will provide a roll-on\/roll-off IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for higher bandwidth SIPRNet and multi-domain networks.\n\n8. E-3 MIDS JTRS (Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System) will use Link 16 to establish a digital kill chain with in-theater combat forces\/shooters.  Current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability\/Dimishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues; does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) & Freq Remap (FR).  MIDS JTRS resolves DMS issues, provides CM & FR,  Link 16 enhancements & growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).\n\n9. AWACS current Combat Indentification (CID) capability has become unsustainable and requires update to stay current with current and evolving threats.  AWACS will address C2 CID shortfalls by upgrading existing capability to provide a persistent Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) combat ID in support of the kill chain and decision superiority.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "Mission: Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) is the premier airborne platform providing battle management (BM)\/command and control (C2) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude\/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.\n\n1. E-3 Block 40\/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40\/45 upgrade will improve integration, quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter, improve Combat Identification (CID), improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI), improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective, faster upgrades via an open-system, Ethernet-based architecture. This upgrade also updates the ground support infrastructure, training systems [(Mission Crew Training Set (MCTS), Mission Computing Maintenance Trainer (MCMT) and the Airborne Training Set (ATS)], data links and the Avionics Integration Support Facility (AISF) all located at Tinker Air Force Base.\n\n2. E-3 Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. The National Security Agency (NSA) declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14.  The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator, while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30\/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 capability on Block 40\/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the Block 30\/35 and Block 40\/45 platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S, a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware, as funding allows.\n\n3. E-3 DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA\/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\/EUROCONTROL (European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene Command and Control (C2) Battle Management (BM). The DRAGON modifications replace the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.\n\n4. E-3 Electronic Protection (EP): The EP program funds the development and retrofit of the E-3 AWACS radar processing capability including risk reduction and EMD activities.  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the operator screen in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  The program will buy COTS equipment starting in FY17 including initial spares.   \n\n5.  E-3 Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) provides continuing system engineering and management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure, AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS), support for equipment concurrency, modernization planning\/analysis, trainer\/simulator integration and concurrency, as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) and Advanced Development Lab #2 (ADL-2). The contractor maintained and operated E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab\/Software Development Facility (SIL\/SDF) provides US, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and international customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration to support radar development, production, and sustainment programs.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. TSI supports trainer\/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. The overall Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E) test infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment projects, and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA.  Funding is shared between Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and production funds.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) AEW&C efforts.\n\n6. E-3 Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR): C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system, or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of material solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as material solutions for the user needs.\n \n7. E-3 Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC): IPEC will provide the Block 40\/45 E-3 with a wideband communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations\/warfare.  The E-3 lacks an IP-enabled communication capability.  As a result, the E-3 is not able to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time sensitive targets.  IPEC will provide a roll-on\/roll-off IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for higher bandwidth SIPRNet and multi-domain networks.\n\n8. E-3 MIDS JTRS (Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System) will use Link 16 to establish a digital kill chain with in-theater combat forces\/shooters.  Current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability\/Dimishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues; does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) & Freq Remap (FR).  MIDS JTRS resolves DMS issues, provides CM & FR,  Link 16 enhancements & growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).\n\n9. AWACS current Combat Indentification (CID) capability has become unsustainable and requires update to stay current with current and evolving threats.  AWACS will address C2 CID shortfalls by upgrading existing capability to provide a persistent Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) combat ID in support of the kill chain and decision superiority.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "a. The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), Combat Control Team (CCT) and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).  JTC TRS is essential to future upgrade and continuation training and currency control requirements due to an increase in USAF JTAC numbers while current and future available air assets to accomplish training are decreasing.  Future JTAC control requirements will exceed the ability of live air to meet, and JTC TRS is the only future capability currently projected to allow USAF JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required controls for both qualification and proficiency demands. The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   JTC TRS will allow JTAC and CCT to perform Close Air Support (CAS), Call-for-Fire (CFF) and Tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions and allow ASOCs to perform Command and Control (C2) missions in a Live\/Virtual\/Constructive (LVC) environment.   Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery training and rehearsal capability. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires.  The PR capability is envisioned to be a \"plug and play\" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue\/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.\n\nb. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC\/CCT and ASOC\/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC\/SOF crew position, and an instructor\/operator station.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, both fielded or approved for full rate production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), Combat Control Team (CCT) and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).  JTC TRS is essential to future upgrade and continuation training and currency control requirements due to an increase in USAF JTAC numbers while current and future available air assets to accomplish training are decreasing.  Future JTAC control requirements will exceed the ability of live air to meet, and JTC TRS is the only future capability currently projected to allow USAF JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required controls for both qualification and proficiency demands. The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   JTC TRS will allow JTAC and CCT to perform Close Air Support (CAS), Call-for-Fire (CFF) and Tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions and allow ASOCs to perform Command and Control (C2) missions in a Live\/Virtual\/Constructive (LVC) environment.   Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery training and rehearsal capability. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires.  The PR capability is envisioned to be a \"plug and play\" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue\/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.\n\nb. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC\/CCT and ASOC\/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC\/SOF crew position, and an instructor\/operator station.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, both fielded or approved for full rate production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The acquisition strategy for the Personnel Recovery (Combat Search and Rescue) capability is to be determined.\n\nb. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP\/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS  development, deployment and integration."

                            "val": "Tactical Air Control Party-Modernization (TACP-M).  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a Command and Control (C2) link for Close Air Support (CAS), Joint Fires Support, airlift, and Air Force surveillance\/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with a variety of targeting and communications systems which interface with ground maneuver forces, CAS aircraft, joint fire assets, C2 aircraft\/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and agencies. TACPs detect targets, coordinate with C2 authorities, and pass precise targeting information to close air support aircraft and fires support units to ensure accurate and timely targeting in the employment of joint fires support.  The actions TACPs perform not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  TACPs also provide ground communications during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives. TACPs support Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and have seen significantly increased mission effectiveness during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  \n\nThe purpose of the TACP-M program is to provide net-centric data communications, battlespace awareness, and targeting capabilities to TACPs operating in operations centers, vehicles, and while conducting dismounted operations.   Data communications, including streaming video, reduce reliance on voice transmissions and enable machine-to-machine data exchange between TACPs and C2 nodes, CAS aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Reliable data communications support interoperability, improve battlespace awareness (BA), increase targeting accuracy, reduce kill chain decision time, improve data flow\/information exchange, and reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian occupied areas. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certified,Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) approved, software-defined radios and ancillary components that provide reliable voice and data communications on UHF SATCOM, UHF\/VHF LOS, SINCGARS, and will soon on evolving networking waveforms such as Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)   \n\nTACP-M is a buy-to-budget program with requirements based on ACC's evolving combat needs and the capabilities available in the commercial market.  As a result, requirements are frequently adjusted to accommodate warfighter needs while working within available funding.  \n\nTACP-M is divided into three segments:  software, mounted capabilities, and dismounted capabilities. The mounted segment is further divided into stationary and mobile elements. \n\nThe software segment provides the Close Air Support System (CASS) software with interfaces to all TACP-M components and joint interoperability with CAS aircraft (A-10, F-16, F\/A-18, AV-8B, etc), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes.  To enable data communications with those systems \/ nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF).   CASS versions 1.4.2 and 1.4.4 are currently fielded.  The contract for CASS v1.4.5 was awarded on 24 Oct 13 and will provide advanced communication and targeting capability on mobile computing devices for Dismounted TACPs, as well as provide significant interoperability improvements in software used in vehicles and operations centers.  Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with CAS aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document(IS ICD),which was approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC), Functional Capabilities Board (FCB), and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB) in 1st Qtr FY14.\n\nThe dismounted segment consists of integrated, non-developmental, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components carried by dismounted TACPs.  These include laser range finders, thermal imagers, laser designators,  manpack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. \n\nThe Mounted (Fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack, or transit-case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  It includes the ASOC Gateway mounted in a High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) shelter, the Gateway Lite mounted in relocatable racks or transit cases, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP) mounted in transit cases.\n\nThe Mounted (Mobile) segment integrates radios, computers, and ancillary equipment into mobile tactical vehicles such as new TACP M1145 and M1165 Armored HMMWV variations, the Army Stryker armored vehicle, and future Army vehicles.  Following the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11, existing capability gaps in TACP vehicle-mounted communications systems have grown. \n\nThe TACP-Modernization ICD, approved by the JROC in Sep 2012, identified significant on-the-move tactical voice, data, and video capability gaps in TACP tactical vehicles.  A subsequent DOTMLPF Study verified that Mounted (Mobile) data communications requirements can be provided by modular, non-developmental, COTS components integrated into TACP vehicles.  Current TACP-M team efforts are focused on incrementally providing new mounted capabilities as funding and technology allow. \n\nIn Mar 2011-Feb 2012, the TACP-M program fielded a Dismounted Communications Package which provided a robust and re-locatable, transit-case mounted communications system for TACPs operating in TOC locations.  In Mar 2011-Jun 2013, the TACP-M program integrated and fielded the GRC-259 mission equipment package, which provided improved on-the-move tactical communications and blue force tracking capabilities for the Army Stryker Light Armored Vehicles.  In August 2013, the TACP-M program fielded the Voice Communications Package (VCP), which provided TACPs \/ JTACs with limited, 2-channel, on-the-move, voice-only communications capabilities for M1165 HMMWVs.  The next increment, Mobile Communications System Increment 0, is planned to add data communications and video receiver capabilities to VCP-equipped M1165 HMMWVs.  This will be followed by a more robust capability that provide essential communications links to C2 and fire support systems on 4 or 5 channels using emerging \/ new Army and Joint Aerial Layer Networking waveforms to M1145 HMMWVs (MCS Inc 1).  Additional MCS increments will provide essential communications, datalinks and targeting capabilities for mounted systems to include current and future TACP vehicles.\n\nIn FY15, the TACP-M program is implementing a multi-award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract to aid in the competitive contracting of Mobile Communication System and other platform integration efforts.  The contract will also support studies and analysis, risk reduction, training and sustainment activities to support planning and execution of current and future program activities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "Tactical Air Control Party-Modernization (TACP-M).  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a Command and Control (C2) link for Close Air Support (CAS), Joint Fires Support, airlift, and Air Force surveillance\/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with a variety of targeting and communications systems which interface with ground maneuver forces, CAS aircraft, joint fire assets, C2 aircraft\/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and agencies. TACPs detect targets, coordinate with C2 authorities, and pass precise targeting information to close air support aircraft and fires support units to ensure accurate and timely targeting in the employment of joint fires support.  The actions TACPs perform not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  TACPs also provide ground communications during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives. TACPs support Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and have seen significantly increased mission effectiveness during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  \n\nThe purpose of the TACP-M program is to provide net-centric data communications, battlespace awareness, and targeting capabilities to TACPs operating in operations centers, vehicles, and while conducting dismounted operations.   Data communications, including streaming video, reduce reliance on voice transmissions and enable machine-to-machine data exchange between TACPs and C2 nodes, CAS aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Reliable data communications support interoperability, improve battlespace awareness (BA), increase targeting accuracy, reduce kill chain decision time, improve data flow\/information exchange, and reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian occupied areas. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certified,Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) approved, software-defined radios and ancillary components that provide reliable voice and data communications on UHF SATCOM, UHF\/VHF LOS, SINCGARS, and will soon on evolving networking waveforms such as Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)   \n\nTACP-M is a buy-to-budget program with requirements based on ACC's evolving combat needs and the capabilities available in the commercial market.  As a result, requirements are frequently adjusted to accommodate warfighter needs while working within available funding.  \n\nTACP-M is divided into three segments:  software, mounted capabilities, and dismounted capabilities. The mounted segment is further divided into stationary and mobile elements. \n\nThe software segment provides the Close Air Support System (CASS) software with interfaces to all TACP-M components and joint interoperability with CAS aircraft (A-10, F-16, F\/A-18, AV-8B, etc), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes.  To enable data communications with those systems \/ nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF).   CASS versions 1.4.2 and 1.4.4 are currently fielded.  The contract for CASS v1.4.5 was awarded on 24 Oct 13 and will provide advanced communication and targeting capability on mobile computing devices for Dismounted TACPs, as well as provide significant interoperability improvements in software used in vehicles and operations centers.  Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with CAS aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document(IS ICD),which was approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC), Functional Capabilities Board (FCB), and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB) in 1st Qtr FY14.\n\nThe dismounted segment consists of integrated, non-developmental, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components carried by dismounted TACPs.  These include laser range finders, thermal imagers, laser designators,  manpack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. \n\nThe Mounted (Fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack, or transit-case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  It includes the ASOC Gateway mounted in a High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) shelter, the Gateway Lite mounted in relocatable racks or transit cases, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP) mounted in transit cases.\n\nThe Mounted (Mobile) segment integrates radios, computers, and ancillary equipment into mobile tactical vehicles such as new TACP M1145 and M1165 Armored HMMWV variations, the Army Stryker armored vehicle, and future Army vehicles.  Following the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11, existing capability gaps in TACP vehicle-mounted communications systems have grown. \n\nThe TACP-Modernization ICD, approved by the JROC in Sep 2012, identified significant on-the-move tactical voice, data, and video capability gaps in TACP tactical vehicles.  A subsequent DOTMLPF Study verified that Mounted (Mobile) data communications requirements can be provided by modular, non-developmental, COTS components integrated into TACP vehicles.  Current TACP-M team efforts are focused on incrementally providing new mounted capabilities as funding and technology allow. \n\nIn Mar 2011-Feb 2012, the TACP-M program fielded a Dismounted Communications Package which provided a robust and re-locatable, transit-case mounted communications system for TACPs operating in TOC locations.  In Mar 2011-Jun 2013, the TACP-M program integrated and fielded the GRC-259 mission equipment package, which provided improved on-the-move tactical communications and blue force tracking capabilities for the Army Stryker Light Armored Vehicles.  In August 2013, the TACP-M program fielded the Voice Communications Package (VCP), which provided TACPs \/ JTACs with limited, 2-channel, on-the-move, voice-only communications capabilities for M1165 HMMWVs.  The next increment, Mobile Communications System Increment 0, is planned to add data communications and video receiver capabilities to VCP-equipped M1165 HMMWVs.  This will be followed by a more robust capability that provide essential communications links to C2 and fire support systems on 4 or 5 channels using emerging \/ new Army and Joint Aerial Layer Networking waveforms to M1145 HMMWVs (MCS Inc 1).  Additional MCS increments will provide essential communications, datalinks and targeting capabilities for mounted systems to include current and future TACP vehicles.\n\nIn FY15, the TACP-M program is implementing a multi-award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract to aid in the competitive contracting of Mobile Communication System and other platform integration efforts.  The contract will also support studies and analysis, risk reduction, training and sustainment activities to support planning and execution of current and future program activities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond-line- of-sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on- and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the datalink to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions.  TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.\n\nTDLs include, but are not limited to:  Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT).  TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016E) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.\n\nThis effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball.  TDLs keep all C2ISR platforms and data linked weapons current\/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond-line- of-sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on- and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the datalink to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions.  TDLs are used by all service theater command and control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.\n\nTDLs include, but are not limited to:  Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT).  TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016E) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.\n\nThis effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball.  TDLs keep all C2ISR platforms and data linked weapons current\/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The Air Force faces a complex future where conflict will range across a broad spectrum of operations and lethality. The Air Force requires capabilities with the maximum possible flexibility to deal with the widest possible range of conflict. The C2C is the enabling program element for C2 Integration\/Modernization. The Air Force is working to establish a C2 framework and architecture to be used as a unifying vision of command and control for each of the services core functions. C2C will support the defense strategy through: integration of air, space cyber and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) C2, through architectural analysis, prototyping, experimentation and innovation to develop cross-cutting solutions, and enable an improved \"sense-to-kill\" cycle time. C2C innovations and experimentation provide strategic, operational, and tactical direction for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to facilitate an integrated mission environment that supports C2 planning and execution for air, space, and cyberspace. In-depth development and analyses of C2 operational, systems, and technical architectures are geared towards identifying capability gaps, identifying required \"to be\" information services, and evaluating C2 program planned improvements. Through prototyping and experimentation, C2C integrates rapidly developing technologies to promote common standards, data sharing, and information services across Air Force and joint warfighting applications to support joint enterprise solutions.\n\nProject 675078, Horizontal Integration (HI) conducts DOTMLPF analyses and assessments to guide cross-cutting, C2 sub-enterprise and cyberspace investment decisions that integrate USAF capabilities into joint and coalition operations. HI identifies, prioritizes, and develops requirements and horizontally integrated solution recommendations to ensure the latest technologies and information services are integrated into a cross cutting C2 system that enables integrated effects in all warfighter domains. The HI strategy will be validated by Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) to ensure that initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs described by the C2 Capability Assessment Team (CAT) and C2 Core Function Master Plan (CFMP) and supporting the 2012 Air Force, Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts. Once validated, HI funds are applied toward identifying the most critical warfighter capabilities and ensuring they are horizontally integrated into both Air Force and joint C2 programs of record.\n\nProject 675140, Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX) are agile and frequent innovation-focused experiments which lead to pre-fielded operational and technical assessments. Constructive, live and virtual, operationally representative warfighter environments are created to support integration challenges which focus on critical C2 areas of interest that support the joint warfighter; including, C2 of ISR innovation that supports the air, space, and cyberspace domains. JEFX provides the infrastructure and integration initiatives for experimentation with emerging operational concepts and attendant new technologies that fill operational gaps in Air Force capabilities to meet emerging and rapidly changing real world threats. The JEFX strategy is validated and supported by the Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC) and coordinated with Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) ensuring initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs and validated requirements described in the AF Core Function Master Plans (CFMP) and supported through MAJCOM Core function Lead Integrator (CFLI). JEFX initiatives are based on emerging CONOPS and warfighter challenges, important enablers of innovation and transformation, which are designed to support the themes and demonstrate emerging Air Force capabilities to deploy and employ decisive air, space and cyberspace power in support of the Joint Force. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

HI activities include:  requirements, architecture, systems engineering, technology development, risk reduction, prototyping, and transition. These activities are required to:  identify, design, develop, experiment, and implement C2 solutions supporting operational requirements for warfighting integration and interoperability needs which are not the sole responsibility of a specific program of record.\n\nThe nature of integrated and interoperable C2 warfighting capabilities spans multiple platforms and domains. These capabilities are routinely being adjusted to meet the changing requirements from the warfighting communities. The HI project is uniquely designed to look across platforms and domains enabling the Air Force to respond to operator needs across the seams of individual systems. These horizontal integration initiatives will be prototyped, assessed, appropriately captured in requirements documents and then transitioned to programs of record for production, fielding and sustainment.\n\nSystems Engineering and analysis is the 'glue' that holds command and control constellation (C2C) elements together and closes the seams in the C2 architectures. Capability analysis identifies areas where interoperability can be improved within the Air Force, as well as among joint services, and coalition partners. Once capability issues are identified, they are prioritized and pilot initiatives are developed to provide solutions to the warfighter challenges to resolve the capability gaps. The HI project also helps to competitively prototype integrated solutions against validated program requirements.\n\nThe benefits of these activities are two-fold:  the operational community is able to weigh the cost, risk, and performance trade-offs between enterprise solutions versus program centric solutions, and it supports competitive prototyping of all acquisition programs.  The synchronization of HI prototyping and program milestone requirements offers an effective environment for increasing interoperability while reducing the impact of this policy on multiple programs.  An infrastructure environment manages a continuous distributed operational environment that supports air, space, and cyberspace C2 and rapid acquisition, prototyping, development, integration, and fielding. C2 initiatives may use this infrastructure to mature their development status prior to entry into operational and technical suitability assessment.\n\nThe HI prototype performances are assessed for operational utility, and the most promising initiatives\/technologies will be matured and transitioned into weapon system configuration control baselines. Requirement documents will be published and revised, and a requirements database and implementation plan identifying the most significant C2C net-centric integration issues will be updated to catalog the activities necessary to accomplish this integration.\n\nIn addition, this project supports concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies that support continuous improvements in C2. Guided by the MAJCOM-validated C2 capability gaps developed by the HI Capability Assessment Team annual process and the defense strategy to meet the evolving Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) threats to air, space and cyber C2 operations, these improvements include but are not limited to:  integration of airspace and cross-domain synchronized operations, C2 of integrated air and missile defense, C2 of Air Force Forces and agile combat support, dynamic aerial network capabilities, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR), from 4th and 5th generation aircraft through processing and assessment, and interoperability with joint service, allied and coalition systems, C2 of personnel recovery, and air-sea battle. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning."

JEFX provides continued integration and experimentation efforts across the AF C2 seams and programs in air, space and cyber domains as defined by CORONA, HQ AF, and the AF Command and Control Integration Center (AFC2IC).\n\nJEFX\/LOE activities explore significant capability gaps across the range of Air Force command and control (C2) by means of assessing Concept of Operations (CONOPS), tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and materiel solutions. The activities address critical lessons learned from recent operations and the validated requirements described in the 2012 Air Force, Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts, the AF Core Function Master Plans (CFMP) and supported through MAJCOM Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI). JEFX creates or leverages operationally representative-experiment enterprise warfighter environments to address joint and coalition warfighter gaps and shortfalls that demonstrate existing and emerging Air Force capabilities to deploy and employ decisive air, space and cyberspace power for the joint force commander and enable innovation and transformation. These unique missions are the major reason JEFX is an experiment and not simply a demonstration or exercise. Activities also include studies and analyses to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning."

DCAPES is the Air Force's single system to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces for contingency and crisis operations.   This system provides a real time, two way interchange of personnel, manpower, logistics, and operational data between the Air Force and the warfighting Combatant Commanders.   It matches people, cargo, and airframes\/weapon systems to the Combatant Commander's warfighting requirements.  Acquisition of this system supports the Air Force's expeditionary force concept.\n\nLOGFAC is a Web-enabled application that resides on Global Combat Support System (GCSS-AF) infrastructure and supports logistics \/ operational planning staffs at the HQ Air Staff, MAJCOM and Unit levels by determining wartime consumables and pre-positioning of AF assets for deliberate planning based on the War Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4).\n\nDevelopment activities include Logistics Module\/Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (LOGMOD\/MANPER B), War and Mobilization Planning (WMP), Enhanced Contingency Rotational AEF SchedulingTool (ECAST), Web Enablement, and JOPES Modernization Migration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management-Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion. Requirements validated with the Capability Development Document for DCAPES dated 2 June 2006. \n\nThis effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES).  DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control.  DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the AF Forces (AFFOR) commander.  DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.\n\nActivities include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

DCAPES is the Air Force's single system to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces for contingency and crisis operations.   This system provides a real time, two way interchange of personnel, manpower, logistics, and operational data between the Air Force and the warfighting Combatant Commanders.   It matches people, cargo, and airframes\/weapon systems to the Combatant Commander's warfighting requirements.  Acquisition of this system supports the Air Force's expeditionary force concept.\n\nLOGFAC is a Web-enabled application that resides on Global Combat Support System (GCSS-AF) infrastructure and supports logistics \/ operational planning staffs at the HQ Air Staff, MAJCOM and Unit levels by determining wartime consumables and pre-positioning of AF assets for deliberate planning based on the War Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4).\n\nDevelopment activities include Logistics Module\/Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (LOGMOD\/MANPER B), War and Mobilization Planning (WMP), Enhanced Contingency Rotational AEF SchedulingTool (ECAST), Web Enablement, and JOPES Modernization Migration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management-Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion. Requirements validated with the Capability Development Document for DCAPES dated 2 June 2006. \n\nThis effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES).  DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control.  DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the AF Forces (AFFOR) commander.  DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.\n\nActivities include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The 707-based E-8C JSTARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It contributes to predictive battle space awareness.    \n\nThis program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nThis program element currently comprises one development program, JSTARS Modernization, and the supporting Test and Infrastructure. Development efforts for the Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS) and Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) developmental programs were completed in FY 2013.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution as well as support to Urgent Operational Needs (UONs).  \n\nI. JSTARS Modernization:\n\nThe JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements.  \n\nAdditional Modernization efforts could include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); Multi-Agency Communication Capability (MACC); CENTRIX; Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nTraining and support systems upgrade efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\nII. Test and Infrastructure: \n\nThe test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of this test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, protection level (PL-2) security, Information Assurance (IA), and range support. All of the developmental programs have been completed. The Joint STARS test infrastructure continues to provide retrofit support to production programs and Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) as required. In FY 2014, the program began the transfer of test infrastructure assets to Robins AFB. \n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The 707-based E-8C JSTARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It contributes to predictive battle space awareness.    \n\nThis program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nThis program element currently comprises one development program, JSTARS Modernization, and the supporting Test and Infrastructure. Development efforts for the Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS) and Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) developmental programs were completed in FY 2013.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution as well as support to Urgent Operational Needs (UONs).  \n\nI. JSTARS Modernization:\n\nThe JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements.  \n\nAdditional Modernization efforts could include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); Multi-Agency Communication Capability (MACC); CENTRIX; Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nTraining and support systems upgrade efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\nII. Test and Infrastructure: \n\nThe test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of this test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, protection level (PL-2) security, Information Assurance (IA), and range support. All of the developmental programs have been completed. The Joint STARS test infrastructure continues to provide retrofit support to production programs and Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) as required. In FY 2014, the program began the transfer of test infrastructure assets to Robins AFB. \n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground\/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility\/Interference (EMC\/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.\n\nIn support of certification, the program recommends about 1000 aircraft\/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft\/store certification capability.\n\nSEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I & II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, F-22 supersonic tank, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111\/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements.    \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or which have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year."

                                            "val": "The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground\/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility\/Interference (EMC\/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.\n\nIn support of certification, the program recommends about 1000 aircraft\/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft\/store certification capability.\n\nSEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I & II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, F-22 supersonic tank, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111\/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements.    \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or which have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year."

It directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing through model and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), acquisition excellence initiatives, and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability, accessibility, reuse, and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within DoD and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating their capabilities within our Air Force LVC environments.  \n\nLVC environments today are used as the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative, USAF M&S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed, they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  These, in turn, enable joint, coalition, and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 50,000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g., Ulchi Freedom Guardian, Red & Blue Flags, Unified Endeavor, etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators, which replicate high demand\/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1,000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. \n\nUSAF M&S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland, including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); this generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption, aircraft wear and tear, and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes, the USAF M&S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models, simulations, tools, and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&S capabilities across the lifecycle, reduce developmental costs, and minimize risks. These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

MSF is the:  standards, policies, procedures, architectures, and tools that enable the rapid and efficient composition of distributed environments to support both the warfighter needs and the US Air Force's (USAF) functional communities of:  acquisition, training, planning, analysis, testing, education, and experimentation requirements.  The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  \n\nMSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsal.  This is done by providing appropriate authoritative data and component representations. With the capability generated via MSF, users will readily access available repositories of reusable, validated, and integrated synthetic components.  Synthetic components include representations of operational battlespace entities (such as friendly and enemy assets) and representations of the natural environment that include the terrain, atmospheric and space weather effects given the proper data sets, and energy and signal propagation effects.  The rapid composition is based on a durable common architecture framework, policies, and common standards.  MSF capability also supports:  efficient, cost-effective verification, validation, and accreditation activity across all of the M&S functional and organizational communities.   \n\nThe Air Constructive Environment-Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS) provides the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is comprised of models that support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and COCOM battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises and experimentations."

Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  \n\nIt includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  \n\nThe Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  It includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combat Commanders (COCOM) battle staffs.  The primary model in the AFMSTT is the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM)."

This reaches 22 geographically separated LVC locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as:  real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include DMO technology and capability studies\/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution.   \n\nThe DMOC utilizes RDT&E funding for the following to enhance DMO training:\n\n1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability\/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various environment generators (i.e. DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Systems Command  (NAVAIR) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS) from version 2.4.14 to version 3.5 over the next two-three years that will provide blue air and other capabilities), DMO tools (i.e. the DMOC Replay Tool is regularly upgraded to allow for a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events (future development will include the Multi-Level Security (MLS) capability), Tactical Air Information Datalink-J (TADIL-J) Doctor-J tool allows tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between differing simulator communication formats), and other capabilities that enhance DMO training (i.e. the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)\/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) project continues the improvement of damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises, and DMOC develops solutions for introducing Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events.  \n\n2.  Certification & Accreditation (C&A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, scenario development, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&A and Networthiness of core systems, and it implements requirements of Information Assurance (IA) Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include C&A of the Distributed Training Network Guard, a DMOC\/NAVAIR partnership and accreditation work for the DMOC Replay Tool, Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) rule set, and the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) filter tool.   \n\n3.  Distributed Training Sites & Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates distributed training sites and systems for DMO training events such as Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (four-eyes event) by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into DMO events each year based on emerging higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (COCOM) requirements.     \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This reaches 22 geographically separated LVC locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as:  real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include DMO technology and capability studies\/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution.   \n\nThe DMOC utilizes RDT&E funding for the following to enhance DMO training:\n\n1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability\/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various environment generators (i.e. DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Systems Command  (NAVAIR) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS) from version 2.4.14 to version 3.5 over the next two-three years that will provide blue air and other capabilities), DMO tools (i.e. the DMOC Replay Tool is regularly upgraded to allow for a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events (future development will include the Multi-Level Security (MLS) capability), Tactical Air Information Datalink-J (TADIL-J) Doctor-J tool allows tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between differing simulator communication formats), and other capabilities that enhance DMO training (i.e. the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)\/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) project continues the improvement of damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises, and DMOC develops solutions for introducing Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events.  \n\n2.  Certification & Accreditation (C&A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, scenario development, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&A and Networthiness of core systems, and it implements requirements of Information Assurance (IA) Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include C&A of the Distributed Training Network Guard, a DMOC\/NAVAIR partnership and accreditation work for the DMOC Replay Tool, Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) rule set, and the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) filter tool.   \n\n3.  Distributed Training Sites & Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates distributed training sites and systems for DMO training events such as Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (four-eyes event) by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into DMO events each year based on emerging higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (COCOM) requirements.     \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Air Force A5XS ensures accurate representation of air, space and cyber space capabilities in joint activities, through modeling and simulation and wargaming activities. The primary activity through which this is accomplished is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force?s Unified Engagement (UE) wargame series. UE is a two-year cycle of planning, execution, analysis and reporting of activities that include workshops, seminars, capstone event, senior leader seminar, and Building Partnership Capacity events. The capstone event includes over 400 Joint, other Agency, and coalition partners supported by cutting edge technology creating the Wargame Information Environment (WIE).  The WIE includes a fully deployable suite of information technology as well as Modeling & Simulation tools supported by multiple servers and workstations.  The WIE evolves with each UE game cycle to reflect technological advancement and game objective requirements. The WIE employs numerous models to provide rigor to analysis of collected data to directly assist planners and adjudicators prior to, during and after game execution.  The WIE offers a state of the art system for document management, office collaboration and chat that is fully integrated into the suite of tools.  The newest addition to the WIE is a web-based tool to show force locations and processing force movement requests.  The WIE provides collaboration tools and information throughout the wargame and associated events.  The WIE provides users with integration of the latest modeling, simulation and analysis tools and also the infrastructure to support the WIE. Additionally, it captures insights and observations in support of post-game analysis and reporting.  This program is categorized in Budget Activity (BA) 07 because it supports the development efforts of operational systems."

Air Force A5XS ensures accurate representation of air, space and cyber space capabilities in joint activities, through modeling and simulation and wargaming activities. The primary activity through which this is accomplished is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force?s Unified Engagement (UE) wargame series. UE is a two-year cycle of planning, execution, analysis and reporting of activities that include workshops, seminars, capstone event, senior leader seminar, and Building Partnership Capacity events. The capstone event includes over 400 Joint, other Agency, and coalition partners supported by cutting edge technology creating the Wargame Information Environment (WIE).  The WIE includes a fully deployable suite of information technology as well as Modeling & Simulation tools supported by multiple servers and workstations.  The WIE evolves with each UE game cycle to reflect technological advancement and game objective requirements. The WIE employs numerous models to provide rigor to analysis of collected data to directly assist planners and adjudicators prior to, during and after game execution.  The WIE offers a state of the art system for document management, office collaboration and chat that is fully integrated into the suite of tools.  The newest addition to the WIE is a web-based tool to show force locations and processing force movement requests.  The WIE provides collaboration tools and information throughout the wargame and associated events.  The WIE provides users with integration of the latest modeling, simulation and analysis tools and also the infrastructure to support the WIE. Additionally, it captures insights and observations in support of post-game analysis and reporting.  This program is categorized in Budget Activity (BA) 07 because it supports the development efforts of operational systems."

                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.\n \nThe Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaced two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive\/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.\n  \nTo meet the unique needs of Air Mobility Command (AMC), the Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) component of MPS will provide a centralized, net-centric global mobility mission flight planning capability.  This capability will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data. \n\nIn addition to the above, elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) in conjunction with the Army.  The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) & insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.\n\nFY15 funding will continue the MPS software development program.  It will develop pre and in-flight mission planning capabilities for a variety of Air Force aircraft and weapons from legacy mission planning systems to the new MPS.  These weapon systems include, but are not limited to the: A-10, B-1B, C-5, C-17, C-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, RC-135, HH-60, and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), etc.).  FY15 funding will also continue the development of MAFPS to realize fuel savings and other efficiencies.  Additionally, it will continue the development of JPADS airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17, C-130, and other selected platforms as necessary.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.\n\nThis project provides for the continuous improvement of mission planning software capabilities that cut across all platforms and systems.  It allows for the investigation of new technologies and products that have the potential for improving mission planning systems.  This includes the continuous upgrading of the MPS framework.  The framework is the underlying baseline capability for all mission planning systems.  It will require regular upgrades to: 1) reduce timelines for route planning; 2) transmit near real-time intelligence data to the platforms; 3) increase the accuracy of the mapping products; 4) provide a Windows-based, commercial off the shelf-based, user friendly product; and 5) retain compatibility with platform changes to avionics and operational flight programs.  Funding will support development and modernization activities for the following efforts within this project area:\n\na. MPS Increment IV:  Continues development activities to complete the initial migration of designated Increment IV platforms (from the Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF) to the new MPS planning capability.  This includes the F-22 Mission Planning Environment (MPE) which will support new capabilities for weapons integration, sensor updates, and avionics changes integrated on board the aircraft.  Planned updates include transitioning selected platform to the Windows 7 operating system.  Additionally, the development effort will also address new and emerging Operational Flight Program (OFP)-generated requirements as identified by the operational users.  Updates to common component (e.g. airdrop and weather) will also be completed as required.\n\nb. Test, Training and Certification:  Continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for CAF and MAF platforms. Funding for these support efforts will be programmed with their associated project\/program in FY14 and the outyears.\n\nc. Operational and Technical Support:  Continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.\n \nNo Budget Year (FY15) funding is requested for this activity.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight replanning as applicable.\n\nThis project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) Phase I capability in conjunction with the Army contract vehicle.  JPADS provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/or standoff precision delivery.  It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc., to accurately deliver payloads to combat and other friendly forces. \n \nThe Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable.  It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop.  In addition, the AFRL-led Precision Airdrop (PAD) Flagship Capability Concept (FCC) effort will transition technology capabilities (including but not limited to Bundle Tracking, Forced Exit, Autonomous Weather Sensing, Humanitarian Airdrop, and Airdrop Performance) to the JPADS-MP PoR and into various CAT software release\/deliverables.  The PAD FCC is also charged with updating airdrop platforms and airdrop related systems to improve accuracy across all airdrop mission types.  The following capabilities are currently planned for development within the JPADS-MP program:\n\na. CAT 2.x includes, but is not limited to, the development and incorporation of Digital Terrain Data (DTED), Wireless Gate Release (WGRS), and aircraft specific Monte Carlo solutions into JPADS-MP.\n\nb. CAT v3.x includes, but is not limited to, updates to the operating systems and standard desktop configuration (SDC), refactor of the weather component known as WinPADS, replaces the Local Area Prediction System (LAPS), and Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE) capabilities.  It also transitions and supports the AFRL PADS FCC capability of bundle tracking.\n\nc. CAT 4.x includes, but is not limited to, Operating System\/Standard Desktop Configuration (OS\/SDC) updates, migration to the new Mission Planning Systems (MPS) capability, combination airdrop, and new map projections including polar stereographic.\n\nd. CAT v5.x includes, but is not limited to, approach headings for guided systems, secondary cargo airdrop release, and transitions AFRL PADS FCC forced exit and humanitarian airdrop capabilities.\n\ne. CAT v6.x includes, but is not limited to, new chute configurations and aerial guidance units, updates ballistics data and dispersion models and transitions AFRL PADS FCC Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and RADAR sensing capabilities for real-time weather.\n\nf. CAT v7.x includes, but is not limited to, OS\/SDC updates, force deployment, and transitions AFRL PADS FCC human effectiveness capabilities.\n\nFY15 funding continues development, testing, and fielding of CAT ver 3.2 software to provide a precision and conventional airdrop capability for AF and other services (e.g. the Army) aircraft platforms.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Programs currently supported include the Information Warfare Planning Capability (IWPC) - the Joint Forces Air Component Commander's (JFACC) system of record for strategy, operational assessment and network mapping\/network nodal analysis.  IWPC is a full-spectrum, offensive and defensive, planning capability.  IWPC is an AOC weapon system component which enables operators to develop courses of action for the JFACC, create Air Operations Directives (AODs) and Joint Air Operations Plans (JAOPs), and nominate IO \"targets\" for inclusion into the Master Air Attack Plan and the Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL).  This project funds the development and upgrade, testing and evaluation, and installation and training of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware, and communications products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.  The project builds functional software modules that are designed to be interoperable with Command and Control (C2) systems such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Joint Targeting Toolbox, and other AOC tools.  This PE funds development and continued research to identify existing military and commercial efforts which can satisfy unfulfilled operational requirements for IO analysis, targeting, planning, and integration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nFunding also supports the National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) program.  The NTNF program provides the US Government's framework to identify the source of a nuclear detonation in US or allied territory. AF contributions to this effort, include, but are not limited to collection of airborne particulate material following an incident. Currently, collection would be accomplished via a WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft, which is a limited availability asset (only one primary aircraft in the fleet).  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is developing a harvester pod with the potential of being mounted on an aircraft that will provide additional capacity to conduct this mission.  Funding will provide integration and testing of that pod.\n\nNo FY15 funding is requested for these efforts.  \n \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Programs currently supported include the Information Warfare Planning Capability (IWPC) - the Joint Forces Air Component Commander's (JFACC) system of record for strategy, operational assessment and network mapping\/network nodal analysis.  IWPC is a full-spectrum, offensive and defensive, planning capability.  IWPC is an AOC weapon system component which enables operators to develop courses of action for the JFACC, create Air Operations Directives (AODs) and Joint Air Operations Plans (JAOPs), and nominate IO \"targets\" for inclusion into the Master Air Attack Plan and the Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL).  This project funds the development and upgrade, testing and evaluation, and installation and training of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware, and communications products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.  The project builds functional software modules that are designed to be interoperable with Command and Control (C2) systems such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Joint Targeting Toolbox, and other AOC tools.  This PE funds development and continued research to identify existing military and commercial efforts which can satisfy unfulfilled operational requirements for IO analysis, targeting, planning, and integration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nFunding also supports the National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) program.  The NTNF program provides the US Government's framework to identify the source of a nuclear detonation in US or allied territory. AF contributions to this effort, include, but are not limited to collection of airborne particulate material following an incident. Currently, collection would be accomplished via a WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft, which is a limited availability asset (only one primary aircraft in the fleet).  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is developing a harvester pod with the potential of being mounted on an aircraft that will provide additional capacity to conduct this mission.  Funding will provide integration and testing of that pod.\n\nNo FY15 funding is requested for these efforts.  \n \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

USCYBERCOM will research, develop, and test technologies and capabilities that allow Cyber forces to conduct future offensive and defensive cyber operations in support of COCOMs, to include title 10 infrastructures and cross-cutting technologies.  USCYBERCOM will also provide the resources for other COCOMs to conduct Offensive Cyber Operations\/Defensive Cyber Operations (OCO\/DCO) planning. An in-house integration team (Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team) will perform research, small scale prototyping, and integration as required to support the mission. Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.  Additionaly, this team will re-tool existing offensive and defensive capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs.  Finally, USCYBERCOM will delegate resources to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Cyber Service componenents to develop deconflicted offensive cyber capabilites.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity funds various development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

USCYBERCOM will research, develop, and test technologies and capabilities that allow Cyber forces to conduct future offensive and defensive cyber operations in support of COCOMs, to include title 10 infrastructures and cross-cutting technologies.  USCYBERCOM will also provide the resources for other COCOMs to conduct Offensive Cyber Operations\/Defensive Cyber Operations (OCO\/DCO) planning. An in-house integration team (Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team) will perform research, small scale prototyping, and integration as required to support the mission. Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.  Additionaly, this team will re-tool existing offensive and defensive capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs.  Finally, USCYBERCOM will delegate resources to the Army, Navy, and Air Force Cyber Service componenents to develop deconflicted offensive cyber capabilites.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity funds various development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL). The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to the rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into three capability areas required for effective operations: Platforms (includes Cyber Mission Platform(CMP)), access, and capabilities. \n\nThe program office provides advanced OCPL cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM, AF major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the cyberspace superiority core areas.  OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM operational directives, and the latest AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, Command and Control\/Situational Awareness (C2SA)), and tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations, and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area leverages cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs, and DOD national laboratories, and other sources. Many program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to mature systems to full operational capability or sustain fielded systems."

This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL). The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to the rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into three capability areas required for effective operations: Platforms (includes Cyber Mission Platform(CMP)), access, and capabilities. \n\nThe program office provides advanced OCPL cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM, AF major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the cyberspace superiority core areas.  OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM operational directives, and the latest AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, Command and Control\/Situational Awareness (C2SA)), and tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations, and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area leverages cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs, and DOD national laboratories, and other sources.

The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance & situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs\/requirements. \n\nFirestarter utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM)), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. . In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA & CND (Computer Network Defense) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions.\n\nAF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks.   It also provides forensic analysis if AF unclassified and classified networks are infiltrated by our adversaries.  AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter\n\nIntrusion Vulnerability Assessment supports the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment \/ Hunter Team (CVA\/H) weapon system and develops new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command(AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA\/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA\/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks & systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess(F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.\n  \n\n\nActivities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThese programs are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The Firestarter program provides new\/improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack.  Also provides defensive Cyber Command and Control\/Situational Awareness (C2\/SA), which enables cyber commanders to monitor Air Force network status and execute courses of action to mitigate threats. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance & situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  Current Air Force systems, such as the Air Force Network Non-classified Internet Protocol Router (AFNET NIPRNet) Gateways, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs\/requirements. \n\nThis program utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it addresses the development and transition of information security, protection, and defensive capabilities and technologies."

Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance and navigation and control components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and advanced rotary wing aircraft.  These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions.  Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft and crew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets.  Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM)-Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Product Manager (PM)-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this project is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA."

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers which are rapidly deployable\/re-locatable and require no Military Construction and limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and evaluates the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under PE 0602786A\/Project VT4.\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is led, performed and\/or managed by the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA and fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602784A and 0603734A (Military Engineering) PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology)."

Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine. \n \nPromising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as part of their processes for licensing new medical products. The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and\/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or medical condition, starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers. Following Phase 1, Phase 2 clinical trials to provide expanded safety data and evaluate the effectiveness of a drug, vaccine, or medical device in a larger population of patients having the targeted disease or medical condition. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large Phase 3 pivotal trials will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human subjects according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.\n\nBlast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee. The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.\n\nProject 810 maturates and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nProject 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin, muscle, and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties. Additionally, this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events, determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces, and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.\n\nProject FH4 maturates, validates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies), validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nProject MM3 supports the Medical and Survivability technology areas with laboratory validation studies and field demonstrations of biomedical products designed to counteract myriad environmental and physiological stressors, as well as materiel hazards encountered in training and operational environments to protect, sustain, and enhance Soldier performance. The key efforts are to demonstrate and transition technologies, as well as validate tools associated with Soldier survivability, injury assessment and prediction, assessments for post-concussive syndrome, and enhancing performance during continuous operations. The three main thrust areas are (1) Physiological Health and Environmental Protection, (2) Injury Prevention and Reduction, and (3) Psychological Health and Resilience. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services.\n\nWork funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0602787A and the Defense Health Program.     \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n\nWork in this PE is performed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ft Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Research Institute of Environ. Med. (USARIEM), Natick, MA; U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, Ft Sam Houston, TX; U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Ft Rucker, AL; the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD; U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Ft.

The focus of the program is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from biting insects and other vectors to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n \nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas: \n(1) Drugs to Prevent\/Treat Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria\n(3) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(4) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(5) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control \n \nResearch is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).\n\nWork is managed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and the U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) and coordinated with NMRC.  The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.    \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603807A, project 808.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n  \nWork in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, MD; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. Significant work is conducted under a cooperative agreement with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation, Bethesda, MD.\n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases."

Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies) and validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.  \n\nThis project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services. The cited work is fully coordinated with Natick Soldier Research Development Engineering Command (NSRDEC), Natick, MA.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; USARIEM, Natick, MA; and the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA."

The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  At entry level weapon power of around 10 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat small caliber mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surface mines, sensors, and optics.  At full weapon system power levels of around 100 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), as well as surface mines, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor\/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n \nWork is performed by the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command, Technical Center, Huntsville, AL."

These technologies provide key capabilities through training methods and techniques that prepare Soldiers and leaders to effectively operate in complex digitized, networked environments; enable the use of embedded training technologies envisioned for future command and control (C2) systems; as well as foster cognitive, behavioral, and psychological flexibility, adaptability, and mission readiness.  Project 792 evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training techniques, and analyzes methods and tools to better adapt training to meet goals and requirements. Increased funding in FY15 for this PE is based on work shifted from PE 0602785A due to need for increased focus on maturation and demonstration of selection techniques and tools as well as training methods.\n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with 0603015A (Next Generation Training & Simulation Systems), 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology) and PE 0602785A (Manpower\/Personnel\/Training Technology.)\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.

These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE validates new selection measures and performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with and PE 0602785A (Manpower\/Personnel\/Training Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and\nthe Army Human Capital Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.

All HIV technology development activities are conducted in compliance with FDA regulations. FDA requires thorough testing in animal models (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and effectiveness prior to approving controlled clinical evaluation of drugs, vaccines, and medical devices in humans. Normally, clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove safety and effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, and device for the targeted disease or condition. An increasing number of test subjects are used in each subsequent phase. All results are submitted to FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for routine medical use. This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), the National Institutes of Health, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nThis project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.   \n \nWork is fully coordinated with work funded in program element PE 0602787A, project 873 (HIV Exploratory Research). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.     \n \nWork in this PE is performed by WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories, and NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. The Henry M. Jackson Foundation, located in Bethesda, MD, provides support for FDA testing and other research under cooperative agreement."

In addition, it is designed to find ways to protect the blood supply from contamination with HIV virus. All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Evaluations in human subjects are conducted to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of candidate vaccines, as required by FDA regulation. Studies are conducted stepwise: first, to prove safety; second, to demonstrate the desired effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or condition in a small study; and third, to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human population trials.  All results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports studies for effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of effectiveness testing in larger populations.  \n\nThis program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement by USAMRMC and NIAID. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.\n\nWork is fully coordinated with work funded in program element PE 0602787A, project 873 (HIV Exploratory Research), and are further matured under PE 0603807A, project 811.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.     \n \nWork in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. Significant work is conducted under a cooperative agreement with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation, Bethesda, MD."

DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements.

The computational expertise and resources enable DoD personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way.  The High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. The total aggregate computational capability is roughly 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS); this capability is expected to double by 2013. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state of the art computer network technologies. The DREN interconnects 45 user and center sites at network speeds of up to 3 gigabits per second. The Software Application Support (SAS) effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.     \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly named Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Project 025 demonstrates pollution prevention tools and methods to minimize the Army's use and generation of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes.  Project 03E focuses on maturation and demonstration of technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army-unique toxic or hazardous materials. This program demonstrates technological feasibility and transitions mature technologies from the laboratory to the user.  Technologies developed by this program element improve the ability of the Army to achieve environmental restoration and compliance at its installations, at active\/ inactive ranges and other training lands, and in modernization programs. Technologies demonstrated focus on reducing current and future environmental liability costs.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nThis program is fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology).\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

The emphasis of this effort includes remediation of legacy materials, e.g., traditional explosives energetics, and unexploded ordinance; management of new materials, e.g., nanomaterials and emerging contaminants; and mitigation of residual impacts from implementation of sustainable technologies and processes.  Technologies matured within this project enable the Army to cost effectively address current and future environmental liabilities resulting from the use of militarily relevant materials and chemicals in the environment. Current and planned efforts enable the Army to efficiently characterize, evaluate, assess, and remediate soil and water at installations, ranges, facilities, and during operations in the face of changing weather and climatic conditions.  Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with the myriad of federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water.  A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies.  This program includes pilot scale field studies to establish technological feasibility and assess performance and productivity of the risk mitigation techniques.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

Work is in support of current and future ground force operations.  Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility for geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services and coalition and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information and analytical tool suites.  Deployable Force Protection (DFP) activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating at smaller, remote bases and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; passive protection to mitigate blasts, direct, and indirect fire effects; and active defense to suppress or eliminate threats and threat systems.  Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and support design and decision aids.  Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology).

The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scalability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.  This effort begins to fill a significant gap in force protection capabilities.

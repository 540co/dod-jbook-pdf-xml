The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.\n\nThe Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&E).\n\nThis project directly supports the T&E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: ALR-67(v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, Advanced 6\" Expendable, Advanced Strategic Tactical Expendable, ALQ-144A, Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.\n\nThis project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD."

The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board EW systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Force, Special Operations, and other EW Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for EW system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past ENEWS quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield\/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support T&E.  SIMDIS has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) T&E and training ranges to provide visualization of T&E and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within DoD dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard EW systems and tactics against these type threats.  The ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board EW systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), OT&E, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  DT, OT and FOT&E support includes AN\/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP),  Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship IR signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and PC class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including T&E of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' EW systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint EW exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations."

The AST\/QF-16 program requirements changed as no AST\/QF-16 assets were procured and funding was required for the Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract only. $0.47 million was also realigned from PU 0610, Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) program\/QF4 to PU 0609, MSST program. The FSAT\/QF-4 program requirements changed due to changes in operational and maintenance requirements. \n\nThe Multi Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) (designated the GQM-173A) program increased in design\/development costs, requiring additional funding in FY 2013 to align to the Contractor's Estimate to Complete and prevent delays in the initial production schedule. The GQM-173A encountered test failures and as a result Milestone (MS) C is now planned for FY 2016. In FY 2013, $10.1 million was realigned from PU 0610\/AST program to PU 0609\/MSST program and in FY 2015 $48.48 million was realigned from WPN (BLI 2280) to continue EMD in order to complete required testing. \n \nThe Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) (designated the BQM-177A) program requires additional funding in FY2015 due to schedule delays and technical issues in the areas of guidance and control, software development, and 6 Degrees of Freedom modeling. $8.52 million was reprogrammed from FY15 WPN (BLI 2280) to mitigate this shortfall.\n\nThe Supersonic Sea Skimming Target (SSST) (designated the GQM-163A) program was funded $2.65 million in FY15 for design\/development to improve the GQM-163A Quad Launch capability.  This budget item includes an increased capability to develop a system capable of firing 4 targets vice the 2 currently in the mission portfolio.  The $2.65 million includes design and development costs, launch control equipment, launcher(s) and incorporates the Joint Advanced Missile Instrumentation which allows for the launch of 4 targets.\n\nIn FY15, the AST\/QF-16 and FSAT\/QF-4 programs were eliminated as a result of Department of Navy adjustments."

In addition to hardware, software and operational concept development, studies will be performed by an University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development. For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.\nAs to specific harware development, this project includes:\n- Subsonic Targets: BQM-177A development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of the Test & Evaluation of major combat weapons systems programs and of fleet training.  \n- Supersonic Targets: GQM-163A, GQM-173A, and supersonic high-diver capability development.  The family of supersonic target capabilities represents supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons systems programs in development.\n- TC and TA\/AS development: TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  TA\/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles. TA\/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA\/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems."

MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS is currently developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS will begin development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations."

This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development\/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations.\nConcept formulation for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  \nThe majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.\nThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.\nOutputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, funding for these efforts, except for the Portfolio Management Decision Support System, is being shifted to PE 0605853N, Management, Technical, & International Support, Project 2221, Joint Mission Assessment Studies, to better align these efforts with other Navy capability analysis efforts."

Produce and deliver Analytical Agenda briefings and assessments.\n\nThe Portfolio Management Decision Support System (PMDSS) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this effort is to refine the system to identify programs as potential candidates for divestment. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. PMDSS will include linkage of programs to N3\/N5 strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on PMDSS by capturing and mapping issues\/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.\n\nThe Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions.

This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower & Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions."

CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP). CNA is highly qualified to meet that need."

This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues\/topics appropriately performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA).

Analyses and solutions relating to support and sustainment in terms of equipment readiness, training, responsiveness and maintaining squadron readiness, development of facilities sustainment and service life programs save the Marine Corps valuable time and resources.  Manpower, force structure, aviation recruiting and retention, and valuations of recruiting, retaining and retiring Marines analyses provide viable personnel solutions in times of shrinking resources.  Intelligence capabilities assessments, analyses of threat assessments from known and unknown enemies, i.e. Al-Qaeda, Northern Africa and Iran, and Joint Irregular Warfare Analytic Baseline (JIWAB) development provide valuable information to assist Marine Corps Intelligence organizations in keeping the force educated and safe.  \n\n- Continued - CNA Initiated - The Marine Corps made available 3% of the annual Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) budgetary funding line (PE 0605154N) to cover the cost of projects initiated by CNA in order to maintain its competency and objectivity. The annual amount allocated to CNA Initiated is subject to adjustment of the PE, and shall not exceed 3% of the PE amount available on 1 April of each year. \n- Continued - Project Development - Efforts expended after a sponsor requested CNA to prepare a proposal for a specific task and continued until such time as the task wasapproved by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or the effort is terminated, either through rejection of the project proposal or at the direction of the sponsor. \n- Continued - General Concept Development - Efforts by CNA analysts and managers that defined a problem, researched the feasibility of projects, and determined necessary resources for execution of CNA's mission.  General concept development can be further defined into two subdivisions, efforts related to CNA's mission in general and those efforts being made towards initiation of a specific task. \n- Continued - Scientific Analyst Program - CNA scientific analysts are assigned to senior USMC leaders in the Washington, DC area and (1) conducted short-term analyses in response to requests from the senior leader; (2) alerted the leader's staff to relevant analytical work CNA may be doing and provided information on current activities and problems involving the leader's area of responsibility to CNA; and (3) assisted in the definition of analytical problems so that they can be properly addressed in specific study efforts. \n- Continued - Quick Response Program -  Quick response projects are defined as efforts that have a need for an immediate start and that are of 90 days or less in duration. The specific study effort must fall within the scope and focus of the previously defined product areas. \n- Continued - Field Program - CNA provided on-scene, analytical support to operational commanders. CNA field representatives assigned to deploying carrier battle groups: Test, evaluation, and experimentation commands, aviation-focused commands, training commands, amphibious groups, the numbered fleets, and the component commands. The field representatives' expertise was primarily used to evaluate operational capabilities, determine the optimal use of resources, analyze exercises, operations, and experiments, and assisted in the development of current operations (CONOPs) and tactics. \n- Continued - Field Exercise Support - The Exercise Program consisted of carefully selected CNA analysts assigned to support various Navy, Marine Corps, and Joint Commanders as they conduct at-sea exercises essential to naval readiness. Specific aspects of exercise support analysis included CNA support during overall fleet exercise activities, detailed data gathering and observations during exercises, and CNA analysis of both synthetic and live training exercises."

This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues\/topics appropriately performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA). \n\nThe Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes are as follows: \nA) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.\nB) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance."

The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. Other evaluation processes: \nA) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. \nB) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO\/N8 for final review and acceptance. \nC) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&L)."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.\nOne important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.\n\nNaval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  \n\nAssessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.\n\nMid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test & Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.\n\nOperations Integration Group:  Classified\n\nCHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS\/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource\/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.\n\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.\n\nThe Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements."

In addition, it develops coherent approaches in coordination with combatant commanders (COCOMs), and appropriate partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative.\n\nThe project scope supports the strategic shift to the Pacific Region with emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Coalition Interoperability.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and Coalition Interoperability requirements. \n\nOngoing cooperative RDT&E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US\/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:\n1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;\n2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;\n3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);\n4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). \n5.

The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize,\ntrain, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises). The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation. It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses. The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments. It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements. The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States. It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs. The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&S community. It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk. The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, this project also includes funding for Concept Formulation (CONFORM) efforts. This is a shift of funding from PE 0605152N, Studies and Analysis Support, Project 2092, Naval Warfare Studies. CONFORM for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them)\ntowards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.\n\nThe majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.\n\nThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.   \n\nOutputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council\nreviews.\n\nCapabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA).

Navy Assessment Program supports the development of platform specific studies and\nCapability-Based Assessments, an analytical effort resulting in Functional Area Analysis, Functional Needs Analysis, and Functional Solutions Analysis. Efforts provide added\nanalytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities, Integration, and Development System and support warfare integration initiatives.\n-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics,\ncapabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material.\nMETRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling\/methodology to\nsupport analysis. Models\/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints.\n-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not\nlimited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of largescale\narchitecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine\nability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category\nProgram Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research\nperformance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned\nsystems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations\nand uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results.\n-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy\nthat work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports,\nmodel\/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21\nto include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.\n-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or\nsupport capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in war fighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems\nand technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program\nplanning to determine the war fighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities.\nDetermine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment\nand transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy.\n-World Class Modeling (WCM), Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements\nprocess that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support\nanalyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation\nplans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports."

Those issue areas included; Trust, Supply Chain, Organic (DoD) Capability Sustainment, and Technology Development.  \n\nIntense global competition in the Printed Circuit Board (PrCB) industry has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of United States PrCB companies, leaving the domestic PrCB industrial base \"fragile\" and progressively declining in capability and health.  Implementation of the strategies developed by the EA for PrCB Technologies will proactively ensure that the U.S. PrCB industry is capable of supporting future DoD electronics requirements.  The strategic plan is expected to indentify technology gaps and research and development needs, as well as identify and recommend policy changes.\n\nIn addition to benefiting DoD by ensuring access to leading edge PrCB technology, it is expected that the EA program will help the struggling domestic PrCB industry by indentifying future technology research and development needs and securing the domestic military market."

This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft\/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&E requirements.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead\/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-1, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN\/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), 0686, and LCS TEMP 1695.\n\nEnterprise Cost elements:\na) SDTS Acquisition includes the direct procurement costs of major Combat Systems (CS) elements which will be installed on the Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS).\n\nb) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nc) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LHA-6, LSD-50, DDG-1000, LCS-5, LCS-6 and CVN-78.\n\nd) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LHA-6, LSD-50, LCS-5, LCS-6 and CVN-78.\n\ne) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).\n\nf) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.\n\ng) Maintenance of CS includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.\n\nThe T&E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation M&S data validated with  results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes.

The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  \n\nAUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water acoustic tracking range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  \n\nMajor test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 \/Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.\n\nAUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier\/marine area include fully equipped machine \/fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track."

These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and T&E aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.

Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources. Funding is also provided for Navy support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) program."

This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop \"minimum, adequate\" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.

This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. \n\n(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability.  The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar\/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations.  It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.\n\n(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections.  The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.\n\n(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program.  The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system\/platform. The program provides design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.\n\n(d) It will support Advanced Technology Concepts. The program investigates Electromagnetic (EM) environmental effects and electromagnetic spectrum techniques and technologies to provide the ability to monitor EM spectrum usage on all ships in a given strike group.  The program will investigate technologies to build an EM Spectrum Common Operational Picture (COP) to detect and assess operational capability in real-time.  Additional investigations will be performed to develop processes and procedures to predict the EM environment.  In the out-years, these capabilities will be used to build the next generation combat system with inherent spectrum agility and self-awareness capability, further enhancing the Navy's ability to command the EM spectrum warfighting domain."

TENCAP's mission is to enable delivery of timely and relevant National Systems data to naval and maritime tactical users.  TENCAP responds to the fleet's top, strategically important capability gaps within National systems and is the Navy's primary interface with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and national agencies for the rapid fielding (12-18 months) of capabilities. These include advanced sensors, onboard and ground processing, and integrated  national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports operational missions in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Precision Strike,  Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) managementt \/ Battlespace Awareness (BA) via multi-source fusion and advanced data analytics. \n\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.  Program baseline will also address research and development on Strategic Signals Collection and Exploitation; Undersea Warfare; Counter Unmanned Air Systems; Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination; Commercial Navigation Radar Detect and Exploit;  Open Ocean Surveillance; Threat Geo-location; and Foreign Command & Control Exploitation.  Link Crimson  fields operational prototypes in order to test new capabilities in a real world environment in direct coordination with the operational user. Link Crimson holistically develops warfighting capabilities by synchronizing insertion of technologies with existing Navy, joint, and national agency programs.   Additional detailed information is available at a higher level of classification.\n\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

TENCAP's mission is to enable delivery of timely and relevant National Systems data to naval and maritime tactical users.  TENCAP responds to the fleet's top, strategically important capability gaps within National systems and is the Navy's primary interface with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and national agencies for the rapid fielding (12-18 months) of capabilities. These include advanced sensor improvements to onboard and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical collection and fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports operational missions for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), enhanced Battlespace Awareness (BA) and integrated fires via multi-source data fusion architectures and advanced analytics. \n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.  Program baseline will also address R&D on  foreign command and control (C2) Strategic Signals Collection and Exploitation; Undersea Warfare; Counter Unmanned Air Systems (passive and active measures); Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination; low power Commercial Navigation Radar Detect and Exploit;  Open Ocean and wide-area Surveillance; and Threat Geo-location.  Link Crimson fields operational prototypes in order to test new capabilities in a real world environment in direct coordination with the operational user. Link Crimson holistically develops warfighting capabilities by synchronizing insertion of technologies with existing Navy, Joint, and national agency program, as well as related operational CONOPS and operator training.   Additional detailed information is available at a higher level of classification.\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."

Provided data in a navigable, searchable, understandable archive that identified gaps in the documentation with the goal comparing current doctrine\/CONOPs and Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) requirements, and identifying any significant gaps and\/or inconsistencies with regard to content, format, vernacular, and methodology.  The results used by DC Aviation and the Aviation Expeditionary Enablers, Headquarters Marine Corps, Aviation (APX) staff to help inform decisions regarding the merger of the Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) and Marine Air Support Squadron (MASS) into a multi-functional air command and control node.\n\n*  Continued: Marine Corps Expeditionary Energy Modeling and Simulation and Utility Enhancement:  On 13 Aug 2009, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) declared energy a top priority.  The USMC Expeditionary Energy Office (E2O) was created in October of that year to \"analyze, develop, and direct the Marine Corps' energy strategy in order to optimize expeditionary capabilities across the war fighting functions.\"  The E2O also has a responsibility to \"advise the Marine Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) on all energy and resource related requirements, acquisitions, and programmatic decisions.\"  To that end, in September 2010 E2O initiated a study under the guidance of the Operations Analysis Division, MCCDC (OAD), to assess the impact of more efficient Energy Conservation Units (ECUs) on energy consumption within a theater.  The study led to the development of a prototype model, the MAGTF Power and Energy Model (MPEM), a transparent and repeatable process for measuring, evaluating and presenting the energy-related performance of current Marine Forces.  OAD selected the Analytical Framework for USMC Expeditionary Energy Investment Study to establish confidence in USMC Performance\/Pricing Models, via Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) and use this as a prerequisite to using the data\/output in POM development.\n\n*  Completed: \nImprovised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Prevention Tool (IDAPT): Developed a multi-attribute decision model that evaluated mixes of infantry anti-armor weapons for both state-on-state warfare (typified by a significant armored threat) and hybrid conflicts (typified by a negligible armored threat).\n\n*  Completed: \nPrepositioning Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA): Conducted a prepositioning CBA to develop a balanced prepositioning strategy that integrated maritime, ashore, CONUS, and OCONUS prepositioning capabilities for deployment and employment of scalable Naval Forces in support of projected Combatant Commander Requirement.\n\n*  Completed: \nCombat Logistics Force (CLF) Logistics Support to Afloat USMC Units: Linked challenges facing the Marine Corps through increased Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) mission requirements while at the same time realizing potential amphibious fleet reductions over the midterm.  Study provided specific recommendations on range and depth of materiel for stocking aboard CLF ships as well as standardized processes for replenishment support to embarked MEU units.\n\n*  Completed:\nMarine Corps Information Operation Center (MCOIC) Marine Information Operations (IO), Military Information Support Operations (MISO) Development Inventory Study:  Study utilized Navy Computer Adaptive Personality Scales (NCAPS) to create an inventory for IO and MISO Marine development.  This inventory is an integral part of the IO and MISO development process for potential Officer and Enlisted Marines serving as IO and MISO positions across the Marine Corps, along with current cognitive tests already in place.  Study focused on developing an Information Operations and MISO Marine profile encompassing both cognitive and non-cognitive factors and incorporated into a model for assessment and development.  Profile allows the Marine Corps to identify those Marines who are likely to be successful in Information Operations and MISO related fields, those who need a greater depth of screening and training, and those who are likely to succeed elsewhere."

As U.S. forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, MCSS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces, as well as develop solutions that may assist with the Afghan transition.  Additionally, as Marine Corps field components begin to increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world MCSS will address operational and analytical requirements requested. Special emphasis will be for the Theater Special Operations Forces (SOF) in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific. \n\nDevelop an enhanced integrated analytic platform that enables analysis of data sources to support near real-time decision making, support new operational applications, and geographic locations.  Upload, maintain, and verify a data analysis program for rapid access and understanding of collections of studies and research reports.  Continue development of a program that provides the commander\/executive decision maker with information in both real-world and exercise scenarios within the joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational organizations (JIIM) environment.\n\nContinue Additional Phases of all efforts initiated in FY13. \n\n*  Continue:  Force Mobility Analysis Support Toolkit(FMAST) Phase IV: Follow-on generates notional Marine Air Ground Task Forces (MAGTFs) that are sufficiently detailed (in terms of grade, rank, and MOS) to inform Table of Organization and Equipment Change Requests (TOECRs) to the Marine Corps' Total Force Structure; explicitly maps the elements of notional MAGTFs based on the 2017 MEB to the Total Force Structure; objectively and accurately evaluates the Marine Corps' capacity to project force in terms of the supply and demand for military personnel and equipment; and\nallows the Marine Corps to measure, with unprecedented accuracy, the degree to which its Total Force Structure is in harmony with its national security obligations.\n\n*  Continue:  Aligning Readiness Reporting and Force Sourcing Methodologies: The goal of this study is to review existing service readiness reporting policy in order to ensure alignment with other force management functions and influence resource allocation within the operating force.\n\n*  Continue:  Amphibious Lift Support to the USMC: Determine whether future amphibious lift will be able to support Marine Corps requirements.\n\n*  Continue:  Amphibious Shipping Availability Risk Assessment Follow On: The goal of this follow on study is to extend the evaluation of operational risk in view of the anticipated ALT POM 15 reductions.\n\n*  Continue:  An Analytical Study of USN's Amphibious Ship Capacity compared to USMC's Operational\/Training Demand: To provide an analytical overview of USN's capacity to consistently provide amphibious shipping in support of Marine Corps training\/operational demand.\n\n*  Continue:  Analysis of Alternative Operational Lift in Support of Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) Missions: The study will examine the feasibility and define the concept of operations (CONOPS) of employing alternative operational lift assets in support of 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) operations across the range of military operations (ROMO).\n\n*  Continue:  Cost Comparison of Full versus Partial Reset of Ground Equipment Returning from OEF: The goal of the research is to examine long-run cost benefit of performing expensive reset maintenance (\"zero miles\/zero hours\" program) on United States Marine Corps (USMC) ground equipment returning from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). \n\n*  Continue:  Effects of Increased Equipment Footprint: Determine whether the Marine Corps' expeditionary capability is being degraded, and if so, the extent of that degradation, due to the increased equipment footprint of the Operating Forces.\n\n*  Continue:  Integrating Women into the Infantry: Assess and analyze the full scope of the impacts of integrating women into the Infantry.\n\n*  Continue:  Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Consumable Equipment and Medicants Requirement Study: This study should build upon the late 2012 study by evaluating biological weapons effects, using same scenario to determine CBRN equipment consumption rates for expendable CBRND equipment. \n\n*  Continue:  Preparing for the next natural disaster in Okinawa: The purpose of this study is to examine USMC coordination with the other U.S. forces on Okinawa, the Japan Self Defense Force (JSDF), Japan Coast Guard, and representatives from local communities on Okinawa in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\n\n*  Continue:  Right Sizing Ground Simulation based Training Capabilities: Assess the Marine Corps' ground simulation based training capabilities in order to influence policy regarding the mix of live and simulation based training that effectively trains to standard while optimizing costs.\n\n*  Initiate:  As directed by MROC 3902.1D all approved second and third quarter FY14 studies and Ad hoc studies as directed by the Marine Corps Commandant, Assistant Commandant and Unit Commanders as well as Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff."

The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n\nMarine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations."

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research & Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items."

The process supports Commanding General (CG), MCCDC and Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command (COMMARCORSYSCOM) by providing funding to priority programs, thus allowing for the examination of concepts and alternatives to support an orderly transition from requirements to initiatives and initiatives to funded programs.  This will permit the POM process to focus on activities of evaluating, prioritizing and integrating rather than defining and resolving raw, immature requirements.  \n\nPhase A activities \"jump start\" high priority programs of the acquisition process. Furthermore, since 70% of a program's life cycle cost is determined during Phase A, this initiative puts resources to work where the return on investment is the greatest. Typical studies conducted on Phase A activities include, but are not limited to Market Surveys, Business Case Analysis (BCA), Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis, Life Cycle Cost Estimates, Cost Comparison Analysis, Acquisition Strategies, and Trade-off Analysis in lieu of an Analysis of Alternatives."

These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  \n\nThe Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system will provide a suite of vehicle-mounted capabilities that enable route clearance patrols to achieve higher rates of advance by accurately detecting and adjudicating potential explosive hazards with reduced hazard interrogation time.  The system will automatically nominate potential hazards on the move and at standoff distance, and then let route clearance teams decide whether to perform more detailed examinations and identification of those hazards using additional tools within the FREHD suite.   FREHD will also provide threat visualization and control capabilities that enable route clearance and allow Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and related mission personnel to remotely view video feeds of the hazard and remotely control the apparatus.  The increased rate of advance will improve route clearance time, while the increased standoff improves force protection."

These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as other related Army missions.  \n\nThe Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system will provide a suite of vehicle-mounted capabilities that enable route clearance patrols to achieve higher rates of advance by accurately detecting and adjudicating potential explosive hazards with reduced hazard interrogation time.  The system will automatically nominate potential hazards on the move and at standoff distance, and then let route clearance teams decide whether to perform more detailed examinations and identification of those hazards using additional tools within the FREHD suite.   FREHD will also provide threat visualization and control capabilities that enable route clearance and allow Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and related mission personnel to remotely view video feeds of the hazard and remotely control the apparatus.  The increased rate of advance will improve route clearance time, while the increased standoff improves force protection."

SOM program will focus on replacing current smoke pots to provide the Joint Land Forces with a medium area screening obscuration device.  The initial increment, Increment 1, will focus on developing a SOM system capable of obscuring the Visual through Near IR wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Future SOM Increments 2 and 3 will incorporate bi-spectral and multi-spectral effects. The SOM has the capability to quickly produce (less than 30 seconds) medium duration (12 minutes), medium area (204 meters length x 12 meters height) screening obscuration effects, screening an area equivalent to three times the size of a large combat vehicle.  The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain; excluding enclosed areas.  SOM will be deployed to accomplish the following mission types:  avoid observation, defense of a battle position, and assault position."

The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations.  After an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I competitive shoot off in FY 2011, Alliant Techsystems (ATK) was awarded the option to continue with Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2015.  FY 2012 supported the continuation of Phase II of the M829E4 cartridge.  FY 2013 funding supported design finalization, design verification, fabrication and initial testing of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) hardware.  The full performance of the M829E4 is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification.  FY 2014 supports conducting hardware and performance testing, mandated Live Fire Test & Evaluation (LFT&E) and completion of Milestone C.  FY 2015 supports qualifying a second source for the composite sabot material.  The current single source supplier for this material has significantly increased the cost for this material, more than doubled, and expressed intentions of possibly getting out of this business.  Qualification of a second source will result in competitive pricing and driving down the unit price cost, as well as mitigate the risk of the current supplier exiting as a supplier of this material.\n\nOne Way Luminescence (OWL): Current legacy small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are comprised of a pyrotechnic tracer mix that allows enemy forces to visually see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.   The objective of the OWL program is to develop and field a full day\/night tracer technology to replace the current M62 pyrotechnic trace cartridge, with a new trace cartridge that is only visible to the shooter and those soldiers in close proximity.\n\nAdvanced Multi Purpose (AMP): The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition to be developed for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  It has three modes of operation including point detonate, delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the M829E4.  FY 2015 supports multiple contract awards for competing prototypes in Phase I of II for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).\n\nMedium Caliber Ammunition: The Target Practice Day Night Thermal (TP-DNT) cartridges are 40mm grenade training cartridges.  The low velocity variant is for training with the M203\/M320 grenade launchers; the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun.  Both cartridges will provide the Warfighter with a non-dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge that provides a visual impact signature seen day or night, by the naked eye, through night vision devices, and thermal weapon sights.  These cartridges will replace the 40mm Target Practice, M918\/M385A1 (Mixed Belt) cartridges and the 40mm M781 cartridges.  It is expected that the unit price for high velocity cartridges will be lower than the Mixed Belt cartridges.  Funding for FY 2015 activities transitions to PE 0604802\/Project EC1.\n\nAdvanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP): The overall program objective is to develop and field an Advanced Armor Piercing (ADVAP) 7.62mm cartridge in order to defeat threat targets and provide overmatch capability versus a broad spectrum of hard targets into the future.\n\nTunable Pyrotechnic Aircraft Countermeasure: This project will support research, development and testing to field new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided-missile threats. Advances in the capability of threat systems to counter current decoys necessitate development of new expendable countermeasures. This program is considered essential to provide Army Aircraft protection against surface-to-air weapon systems.\n\nAmmunition Logistics Prototyping: This project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter."

During Phase I (15 months), the Government awarded two separate Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts culminating in a demonstration test and competitive source selection to down select to one contractor for the 31 month Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) Phase II.  The down select was based on the demonstrated performance of the cartridge design, proposed systems engineering and management approach for Phase II, and the total program cost estimate for each contractor at the time of the demonstration test.  ATK was awarded the option to continue EMD Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2014.  Upon successful completion of Milestone C, a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option will be awarded to ATK in 3Q FY 2014.  The contract also contains options for two additional production years.

AMP is the material solution for breaching reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O), a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the M829E4.  FY 2015 supports multiple contract awards for competing prototypes in Phase I of II for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD)."

Both cartridges will provide the Warfighter with a non-dud producing, environmentally friendly training cartridge that provides a visual impact signature seen day or night, by the naked eye, through night vision devices, and thermal weapon sights.  These cartridges will replace the 40mm Target Practice, M918\/M385A1 (Mixed Belt) cartridges and the 40mm M781 cartridges.

Additional benefits of the OWL program, depending on the technology that is selected, include a possible reduction in unit cost compared to the pyrotechnic trace round and the potential for every round to provide a both a trace and Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) capability, thereby increasing soldier survivability."

In May 2012, Phase I (Design) of the Stryker ECP program was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants (completed).  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  ECP Phase II contract awarded in Novermber 2013, which continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Phase III (Production) decision point will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  Beginning in FY15, PE Number 0203735A\/Project EE2 funds the Stryker ECP program, which was originally funded by PE Number 0603653A\/Project C03 (FY13) and Project C51 (through FY14)."

The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to forces on a global scale.  The REF provides the Army's rapid response capability to develop, prototype, acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed, deploying and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment and spiral development.  It plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs, desired future force capabilities and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders. \n\nThe REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years. The REF Headquarters Operations team will coordinate in theater work with Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver and sustain solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility, permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution. \n \nAs the REF procures the COTS and GOTS solutions in the future that are not Type Classified or an Army Program of Record (POR), there will be a substantial logistics\/sustainment tail that accompanies these capabilities, particularly as these solutions are being employed in immature or austere theaters where the logistics infrastructure is not already established.\n\nThe REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military\/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  \nThe REF key tasks are:\n\n- Partner with Army Service Component Commands and be responsive to tactical unit commanders in a global operating environment\n- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement\/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement\/Joint Emergent Operational Needs Statement (ONS\/JUONS\/JEONS) Gaps to meet urgent needs\n- Develop material solutions to counter emerging global Asymmetric Threats with reduced Soldiers in the operational environment\n- Ensure training, transportation, and sustainment are provided with every capability\n- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands\n- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army \n- Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment\n- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law\n- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units \n\nThe REF Integrated Priority list (RIPL) consists of the REF top seven priorities based on requirements received from deployed units, and drives all REF efforts.  The priorities with associated metrics as of 31 January 2014:\n\n1.  Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat (24 Requirements\/13 Projects)\n2.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)\/Patrol Base (PB) Sustainment (35 Requirements\/32 Projects)\n3.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)\/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection (47 Requirements\/32 Projects)\n4.  Dismounted Operations Support (60 Requirements\/43 Projects)\n5.  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operational Environments (OEs) (49 Requirements\/30 Projects)\n6.  Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command (12 Requirements\/7 Projects)\n7.  Other (43 Requirements\/24 Projects)\n\nTotal:  270 Requirements\/181 Projects\n\n\nFY12 metric shows the REF average procurement unit cost of $1.1 million per requirement. \n\nThe REF FY15 RDT&E Request of $6.120 million (Base) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection; Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Defeat; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and Tactical Command; Control and Communication tools. \n\nRDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions. RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed US Army Forces problems with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier- any modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) item has to be tested."

We expect to increase our engagement within the Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations. REF's Expeditionary Labs are deployed to provide engineer support directly to Soldiers as they execute their missions in austere environments within a smaller logistical footprint.

We also expect to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Response Force (GRF) as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.

The REF focus is on rapidly placing game-changing capabilities into Soldiers' hands. This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: rapidly adapting Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) equipment to meet operational needs and developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia. All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment is provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved program of record or terminated through the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army equipping and fielding decisions.  REF capabilities routinely serve to bridge specific Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) and Joint Emergent Operational Needs Statement (JEONS) gaps to meet urgent requirements."

The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National agencies, Labs, Industry Partners and Academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these National capabilities into enduring Army programs."

Near term efforts include the integration of goggles with the weapon sights for Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) in a realistic operating environment, thereby increasing Soldier lethality. This project also develops a Family of Weapon Sights (FWS) with fused electro-optical performance, including focal plane arrays and high resolution micro-displays.  FWS enabling technologies increase product resolution, range, and imaging performance. New technologies will improve Soldier lethality, survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort to combat and training environments. In addtion this project will explore insertion of technology that improves the Soldier's ability to detect Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Detection."

Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced products that give Soldiers superiority on the battlefield.  Near term efforts include the integration of Helmet Mounted Displays (HMDs) with weapon sights for a Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) capability in a realistic environment, increasing Soldier situational awareness and lethality and integrating technology, which detects enemy snipers using precise target information to mitigate operational risk before sniper fire occurs.  This project also integrates high resolution thermal focal plane arrays, integrated ballistic solutions for auto-adjusting reticles, and wireless technology with weapon sights, increasing range, performance, and capability, while decreasing system size and weight.  These integration efforts improve Soldier situational awareness, lethality, survivability, mobility, and comfort in combat and training environments."

However technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  This program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration\/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site\/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention).  All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., \"technology is heading for user to implement\")."

The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment.  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, \"Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management.\"\n\nOur broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at our installations.  The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community."

The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by an EAB Working Group (EABWG) that includes staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The EABWG coordinates all NDCEE activities and reports back to the EAB Principals.  The EABWG is, in turn, supported by a Technical Working Group that addresses the details of NDCEE program execution.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program also assists in the formulation of suggested technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative \"shop floor\".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks."

The project increases operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier and worker health risks and environmental quality impacts that would otherwise result in restoration needs and compliance enforcement actions against installations while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army.  The project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data.  Materials and processes demonstrated under this project are inherently more sustainable than the baseline with respect to environmental, safety and occupational health concerns, thereby reducing life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users."

The Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated  Network Management to optimize  planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Increment 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio (HNR), with the Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight (LoS) network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.  WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T adopts \"Colorless Core\" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the \"core\" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between Inc 1b and Inc 2.\n \nWIN-T Inc 3 mature NetOps technologies will be inserted into Increment 2 units."

It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe ADM of September 27, 2013 authorized the procurement of 98 additional communications nodes for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), bringing the total LRIP quantity to 1030 communications nodes. The Program Manager (PM) procured the authorized quantities on the current initial production contract (W15P7T-10-D-C007). This contract was awarded in 2010 as a three year contract with three option years.  Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the LRIP contract have been procured, and Lot 5 is anticipated to be awarded in March 2014. \n\nInc 2 provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  Inc 3 NetOps will be technically inserted into Inc 2 and these inserts will be tested in subsequent Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events."

The certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) stated that the Army will restructure the WIN-T Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to absorb the former Joint Network Node (JNN) Network program.  It further stated that the restructured program will consist of four Increments: Incs 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAn evolutionary acquisition strategy is being utilized to provide for the timely insertion of new technologies into Army communication systems by adhering to the basic principles of the DoD Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA).  This allows the Army to keep pace with changing commercial technology and maintain required interoperability with other joint, strategic and commercial standards-based networks. Applying integrated Network Operations (NetOps) capability, WIN-T provides the capability to manage, prioritize, and protect information. It ensures NetOps commonality with Joint, Allied, Coalition, Current Force, and Commercial voice and data networks.   \n\nThe program is presently in its Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase, as WIN-T Inc 3 technology is being tested and released over time and will be inserted into WIN-T Inc 1 and Inc 2.  \n\nADM issued 24 Jun 13 required: Delay of follow on contract award until Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) are approved and traced to contract specifications.

The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractor facilities."

The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractor facilities."

Army watercraft equipment supports the conduct of riverine, Logistics Over The Shore (LOTS), Joint Logistics Over The Shore (JLOTS), inter and intratheater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and its Major Components). Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and\/or denied access scenarios. The Army uses a spectrum of lighterage and floating craft, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intratheater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to ocean-going and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port\/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems to support LOTS\/JLOTS. The development of the Maneuver Support Vessel-Light (MSV-L) Capabilities Production Document (CPD) will ensure the Army addresses the most glaring capability gaps within the Army Watercraft fleet.\n\nFunding will also be used to enhance the maturation of equipment, systems and sub-systems into Army Watercraft for the purposes of improved performance, energy efficiency, environmental, and regulatory compliance.  The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will advance critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, as informed by the Army Watercraft Systems Board of Directors (AWS BOD).\n\nFleet wide funding requirements will complete core requirements for development, prototype operational testing, and military unit assessment of several projects.  Core requirements include: externally-mounted accommodation units in support of crew and supercargo berthing; integration of Escalation of Force (EoF) force protection enhancements (both lethal and non-lethal); and development of Battle Command on the Move (BCOTM) and Common Operating Picture (COP)\/interoperability aspects of existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).  The development of environmental and energy efficiency technologies will also be addressed, to ensure continued compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. Funding also furthers the development of digital technology integration in the areas of near and real time logistics management, area situational awareness, trend analysis, Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+), equipment monitoring and diagnostics\/prognostics and related functional areas, as well as development of ship to shore (at sea transfer), Economic Useful Life (EUL) and corrosion technologies."

The Technology Development programs support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment.  The mission includes developing onboard fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; developing water reutilization systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield."

This project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, and maintenance platforms. This project develops critical enablers that support the Quartermaster (QM) Force Transformation Strategy and The Army's Modular Capabilities by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support."

ULCANS utilizes a snag-free design and is capable of use in all types of weather and climatic conditions except in heavy snow and in winds greater than 46 MPH. ULCANS Desert Radar Scattering, Desert Radar Transparent, Woodland Radar Scattering, and Woodland Radar Transparent Variants are integrated systems that are very lightweight, easily deployable, versatile, user friendly and tailored to the equipment meeting the requirements of operations for combat systems, command and control equipment, logistic support sites, tactical facilities, and fixed facilities for mobile systems. RDT&E funding supports formal development of new ULCANS variants (snow, urban, aviation, 2 sided system) and necessary technology\/signature enhancements for current ULCANS variants."

Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness.  Programs are aligned to meet future force requirements identified within concept documents and organizational structures.  This Program Element also provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans.  The Projects supported by this PE are: \n\n(PROJ 808) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. Efforts include vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and insect control measures.  These funds support human clinical efficacy trials of the drug\/vaccine in a larger group that are designed to assess performance and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Products from this project will transition to 849.\n\n(PROJ 811) funds the development of military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  It provides funding for planning and conducting of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess the drug\/vaccine for safety, tolerability, how the drug\/vaccine is distributed, metabolized, and excreted from the body, and investigate the appropriate dose for therapeutic use.  Products from this project will transition to Project 812.\n\n(PROJ 836) funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  This project also funds the human clinical trials that test the safety and effectiveness of biologics, devices and demonstration.  Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.  Products from this project will transition to 832. \n\n(PROJ VS7) funds program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the fleet of Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters that continue to play a major role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The approved force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies.  Products from this project will transition to VS8.\n\nThis program is managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA)  of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command."

These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and determining if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms capable of infecting service members\/preventive medicine measures.  These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug\/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug\/vaccine works, and to continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers.  Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices.  This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed; to enhance battlefield readiness.  All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members.  Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production)."

In addition, novel findings in cellular immune responses in the stomach have driven new requirements for evaluation of cytotoxic T cell responses in the peripheral blood.  During FY15 collection of late invasive samples for safety and effectiveness clinical trials RV306 and RV328 will be completed; those samples have a requirement for immediate processing and analysis.  During FY15 RV306 and 328 should conclude, with closing costs associated with the 5 clinical trial sites associated with those protocols.  Additional funding for analysis of safety and immunogenicity data by EMMES Corporation will be required. In addition, there will be costs in FY15 from analysis of new lots of the gp120 to be used in efficacy trials currently approved for FY16-17 . We anticipate these costs to be a) analysis of new immunogens in antigenicity assays; b) preclinical animal studies; c) safety and tox; d) bridging study against gp120 AIDSVAX B\/E. In addition further support of stability of AIDSVAX will be required."

The Eye Tracking System for Assessing Concussions (system is a traumatic brain injury diagnostic tool) is one of multiple systems to be evaluated.  Efforts to collate all non-invasive technologies into one integrated IPT is currently in place.  The 3 technologies currently involved are the Eye- Tracking System, the QEEG and Balance Platforms.  Future components of the multi-focused approach will fall under the scope of this line item.  No Research Development Test Evaluation (RDTE) funds are needed for FY15.  This project line is being programmed in FY16-20 plan under non-invasive nuerodiagnostic line item.  TBI Diagnostic Assay System: This effort has seen a dramatic realignment of effort and scope away from Banyan Technologies to Abbott Labs.  The focus of this effort will be to use the current Biomarker technology developed by Banyan and cross-level all known technologies to Abbott Diagnostics.  Contracting efforts will be developed to facilitate this path forward.  Once contracting efforts are completed, a path forward will be developed.  Impedance Threshold Device for the Treatment of TBI: Current device has a 510(k) (Premarket Notification) clearance for multiple indications.  Will continue the submission of a new 510(k) is planned to cover the expanded indications for the currently fielded device.  Device will no longer be a stand-alone product, because the capability will be incorporated in existing ventilators.  Hydration Status Monitor (HSM) transition was delayed until FY15.  Milestone B for this effort is scheduled for Feb 2015.   Contract is planned to be a 4 year effort to develop the actual device and gain FDA approval for use.  Compartment Syndrome Pressure Device: Will transition from project 840 6.3 funding and enroll patients in the pivotal trial for FDA clearance for anticipated FY15 start of the clinical trial."

In 2009 a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  In 2010, the AMEDD accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades, retrofits, trains, and sustains the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission."

The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach that integrates mature technologies to build to the full capability. Air SS reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved environmental cooling, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and miniaturized communication devices."

The adapter will accommodate shock tube that is cut in the field. The adapter will be the primary interface between Remote Activation Munitions System (RAMS) or similar firing device receivers and current shock tube used by U.S forces. The adapter must not possess any stored energy when emplace or enabled and be a reusable device. The adapter will provides the EOD technician means of rapidly emplacing demo to neutralize Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and deliberate explosive devices reducing soldiers' time on target, and combat load.\n\nThe Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) Blast Overpressure Tool (VBOT) will be a factory loaded explosive tool used by EOD units to defeat suspected VBIEDs while reducing likelihood of collateral damage caused by fire.  The program will modify a government-off-the-shelf design to meet current requirements and qualify that system for fielding. This Program was directed by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army via the Capability Development for Rapid Transition process as a follow on to the urgently fielded capability called the VBIED Modular Disruption System (VMODS).  VMODS was urgently fielded to replace a previous urgent fielding of MAXI-CANDLE which was no longer producible due to obsolete materials.\n\nThe Gunshot Detection System (GDS) was identified by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army for insertion into the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved on 13 Feb 2009.  The Active Protection System (APS)\/Hostile Fire Detection (HFD) program intends to build off the Gunshot Detection System capabilities, and include additional vehicle threats and countermeasures.\n\nThe FY 2015 Base funding in the amount of $0.845 million will be in support of the Spark Gap (SG)-Shock Tube Initiator program and the VBOT (Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) Blast Overpressure Tool)programs."

The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network enterprise for disseminating time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to complete consolidation and replacement of existing IBS terminal capability. The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS systems, and they satisfy RF Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers\/consumers across the Joint Services. JPO IBS Terminals performs JTT life cycle program management through fielding and sustainment of recently upgraded JTT equipment which includes technical fixes as needed in the newly upgraded IBS network that now uses new crypto, a new Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB), and the Common Message Format (CMF). Funds support continued technical fixes\/enhancements, configuration management for JTT crypto\/CIB\/CMF capabilities after the FY14 Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the newly upgraded IBS network enterprise."

Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, AoAs are required to be completed for a new program start prior to its first Milestone (MS) Decision. AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete and approve an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision and do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity.\n\nThe Army is projecting to start work on several AoAs beginning in FY 2015, and will assess and fund the highest Army  priorities during the year of execution."

Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, AoAs are required to be completed for a new program start prior to its first Milestone (MS) Decision. AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete and approve an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision and do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity.\n\nThe Army is projecting to start work on several AoAs beginning FY 15, and will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.\n\nThis effort, EC7-APE 644100 Analysis of Alternatives for FY15 and beyond, is a realignment from DX1-APE 644115 Technology Maturation Initiatives."

The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on July 30th 2013. Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current capability, Global Positioning System (GPS), is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions which means that PNT access and integrity to the Warfighter cannot be guaranteed. This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.\n  \nAssured PNT consists of a set of mutually dependent products that provide a cumulative effect to enable the Assured PNT capability. The Assured PNT program focuses on platform distribution of PNT, scalable PNT architectures that pace the threat, and the ability to upgrade to future technologies, including Military Code (M-Code), at a much lower cost than the current architecture of GPS user equipment (UE). M-code was designed to further improve the anti-jamming and secure access of the military GPS signals.\n\nAssured PNT is a family of solutions which includes four subprograms: (1) The Pseudolites subprogram provides PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. The Pseudolites subprogram enables continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker, Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions; (2) The Mounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors and provides PNT platform distribution. The Mounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires, protects and distributes secure PNT on stationary and vehicular platforms. The mounted materiel solution is a modular, scalable form-factor that paces the threats and enables PNT on the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance\/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability also known as VICTORY and Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) Architecture; (3) The Dismounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors for platform distribution of PNT on the Soldier. The Dismounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires, protects and distributes secure PNT wirelessly on the soldier; (4) The Anti-Jam subprogram provides GPS signal protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through anti-jam technologies.

The materiel solutions are partitioned into subprograms that are at various stages of technical maturity, and include Pseudolites, Mounted PNT, Dismounted PNT, and Anti-jam. The strategy for the Pseudolite subprogram includes technology development accomplished through two competitive, cost-plus incentive fee (CPIF) contracts; this includes development and testing of critical system technologies including command and control, anti-tamper, and PNT determination technologies following a MS A Decision in FY 2015. The Milestone B decision is planned for FY 2017. The strategy for the Mounted PNT subprogram includes technology development accomplished through two competitive CPIF contracts following a Milestone A decision in FY 2016; this includes open-system architecture development to enable industry to provide PNT solutions that \"plug-in\" to the Mounted PNT Hub, increasing competition and innovation across the life of the program. The strategy for the Dismounted PNT subprogram includes technology bridging activities to facilitate a small-business innovative research (SBIR) performer to support a Milestone B decision in FY 2017. The strategy for the Antijam subprogram consists of a Milestone B in FY 2016 to initiate Engineering and Manufacturing Development with two contractors, focused on size-weight, power and cost (SWAP-C) optimization of the anti-jam technologies. The above acquisition strategy is pending approval by the Milestone Decision Authority."

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat UAS, CM, and RAM. The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

The Government also plans to fund the Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) for the development and testing of the MML.  The MML development schedule assumes use of this organic industrial base.\n\nNo new contracts are anticipated in support of the development of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2-Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) Block I effort, unless determined to be necessary.  The Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) will further inform decisions on new contracts.  The Government will use existing contracts and work performed by other Government agencies.  The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will fund AMRDEC and LEAD to perform additional work.  The Government will use the following contracts:\n   \n   - No new contracts are anticipated to develop and integrate the IFPC suite of missiles to the Technical Fire Control (TFC) and IFPC Inc 2-I Block I Interceptor uplink.  The existing contract will also be used to procure test missiles to support Pre-Milestone B activities and the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.\n  \n   - The government anticipates using the Army's Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) contract to support development, test, and integration of the IFPC Inc 2-I Block I Interceptor with the IBCS and the MML. \n \n   - The government anticipates using the Army's Sentinel contract to incorporate sensor software upgrades to enhance detection of small radar cross section (RCS), slow-moving, and low-flying targets."

The LEMV platform is a hybrid airship that achieves vertical lift from helium contained within its hull making it lighter-than-air and from traditional engine propulsion that produces thrust to provide lift.  The LEMV prototype requirements are to achieve 21 day endurance in 20 knot continuous winds, carry 2500 pounds of multiple surveillance and communication payloads, operate at a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet Mean Sea Level, and provide 16 kilowatts (kW) of power to the payload. The LEMV system is recoverable and reusable. The LEMV system prototype and associated technologies will be evaluated during a Joint Military Utility Assessment (JMUA) in an operational environment upon completion of developmental testing."

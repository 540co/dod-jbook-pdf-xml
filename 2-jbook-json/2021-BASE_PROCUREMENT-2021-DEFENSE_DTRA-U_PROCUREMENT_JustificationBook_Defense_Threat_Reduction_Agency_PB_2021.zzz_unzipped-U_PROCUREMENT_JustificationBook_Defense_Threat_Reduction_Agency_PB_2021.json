DTRA accomplishes this mission by procuring items to support the following:\n\n-  Sustaining an advanced information technology and fusion infrastructure that enables a threat awareness and understanding capability;\n-  Providing expeditionary, forward-deployed operations, intelligence, training, and advisory capabilities with reach back support; enabling rapid and innovative counter-improvised threat solution development and delivery;\n-  Supporting Military Departments\/Services' pre-deployment training and Combatant Commanders' priority training-exercise support requirements;\n-  Leveraging broad Communities of Action that include DoD, other U.S. Government departments and agencies, key coalition allies and partners, academia, and the private sector to employ their capabilities, expertise, access and authorities to counter threat networks and their use and facilitation of improvised weapons."

These kits support combat operations by equipping troops with a self-contained analytical tool kit that extends DTRA's combat support and intelligence analysis capabilities into forward operating locations.  These locations have minimal or no existing communications infrastructure or tactical intelligence support. \n-  Lifecycle replacement of a high-performance computing platform (primary system and disaster recovery fail-over system) that supports warfighter capabilities for use by Combatant Commands, Theater Special Operations Commands, forward-deployed combat troops, and mission partners in the DoD, Intelligence Community, Services, Homeland Security, and Law Enforcement community.\n\nThe FY 2021 OCO budget of $2.540 million will fund the lifecycle replacement of seven (7) JEKs (one third of existing kits are replaced each year under a three-year lifecycle replacement plan) and procurement of two (2) additional JEKs to support additional requirements, for a total of nine (9) JEKs. JEKs are used by forward-deployed troops operating in austere locations around the globe. These JEKs support combat operations by equipping troops with a self-contained analytical tool kit that extends DTRA's combat support and intelligence analysis capabilities into forward operating locations. These locations have minimal or no existing communications infrastructure or tactical intelligence support. The three-year lifecycle management\/replacement plan is required because these kits operate in sub-optimal conditions in forward-deployed locations and are subject to accelerated operational wear and failure in the field.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2020 to FY 2021 is due to revalidation of procurement requirements."

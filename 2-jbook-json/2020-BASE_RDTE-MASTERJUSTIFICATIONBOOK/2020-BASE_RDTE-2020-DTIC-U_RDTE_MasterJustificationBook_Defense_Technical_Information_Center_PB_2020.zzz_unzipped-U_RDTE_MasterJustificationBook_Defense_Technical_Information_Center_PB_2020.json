DTIC, a DoD Field Activity, currently under the authority, direction and control of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)), is the DoD\u2019s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and industry-related information.  During FY 2019, DTIC is slated to realign under the DoD Chief Management Officer (CMO).  Under the CMO, DTIC will focus on the enterprise data management mission of the Department.  DTIC also operates DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs) focused on Defense Systems, Cyber Security and Information Systems, and Homeland Defense and Security.  Both DTIC and IAC operations are focused on actively supporting USD(R&E) efforts in generating decisive and sustained U.S. military advantages through the pursuit of three distinct lines of effort, as outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS):  \n\n1)  Rebuild military readiness as we build a more lethal Joint Force:  DTIC\u2019s support, search, collection, collaboration sites, and IAC services offer an underpinning element available to all Agencies, Program Offices, and Research Labs that contribute to the rebuilding of the Joint Force.\n2)  Strengthen alliances as we attract new partners:  The International Agreements Database (IAD-B); support to the OSD Comparative Technology Office (CTO); DTIC\u2019s COCOM reading room providing industry insight into COCOM S&T needs; and participation in NATO\u2019s Science & Technology Organization (STO) Collaboration Support Office (CSO); these efforts provide a complement of tools and cooperative activities that foster the relationships that underpin our alliances.\n3)  Reform the Department\u2019s business practices for greater performance and affordability:  DTIC\u2019s support, search, collection, programming, collaborative sites, and IAC services are a ready source for best practices and collaborative partnering and team building as the Department works to improve processes and access.\n\nIn concert with the 2018 NDS, DTIC's investment in new tools and capabilities will address customer needs and underwrite the innovation necessary to support DoD\u2019s enduring mission to provide combat-ready military forces to deter war and protect the security of our nation.\n\nThe Department invests over $90 Billion annually in Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) needed to protect and defend our nation.  DTIC preserves the fruits of these costly labors for reuse across the enterprise.  As an efficient and cost-effective steward of technical information, DTIC collects data and provides answers to researchers seeking state-of-the-art data relevant to their projects.  Through this interchange of information, DTIC accelerates innovation and prevents duplication of experiments, tests, and prototyping activities because researchers can build on what has been done or choose other paths if prior research resulted in a dead end. Using DTIC-created forums, researchers, Warfighters, and industry partners can also rapidly collaborate and connect across the DoD research and engineering (R&E) enterprise.  Finally, DTIC provides a department-level map of R&D activity.  This map gives decision-makers insight into current and past research, highlighting where progress is being made and by whom.  Through the preservation and sharing of the results of billions of dollars of past DoD investments, DTIC increases the return on past investments and accelerates current efforts, saving the Department precious time and dollars.  Through its collaboration tools and outreach to the R&E community, DTIC connects researchers across the lab enterprise, to include researchers and engineers, Warfighters and DoD\u2019s industry partners.\n\nDTIC\u2019s strategic themes center on customer focus, innovation, operational excellence, and strategic partnering.  In support of these themes, DTIC\u2019s organizational efforts are focused on the following priority areas:\n1) Search:  Develop new algorithms that enable our users to quickly discover useful information and to ensure we present the most relevant information.  Semantic (machine learning) mapping of information for comprehensive and precise data retrieval--built on DTIC\u2019s custom thesaurus (for use by DoD and Allied partners).  Expand and enhance our data collections to improve the quality and completeness of the data. \n2) Collaboration:  Provide collaboration platforms for the DoD science and technology community to work together on investments that efficiently deliver solutions to the Warfighter.\n3) Access Identity:  Strengthen methods of user authentication through the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) tokens, biometrics and other methods to grant access to recognized, trusted and authorized users.  Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC\u2019s stewardship (protect information access).\n4) Data Fusion\/Analysis:  Gather information from multiple data sources and provide knowledge products that fuse the disparate data sets into a single view of the life cycle of research.  Present an overarching picture of research investment that enables decision-makers to link multiple efforts with integrated capabilities (employ resources to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across Services).  \n5) Cyber Security:  Continue to leverage state-of-the art technologies, processes and practices designed to protect DTIC networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.\n6) Data Center Optimization\/Cloud:  Migrate services to cloud providers to improve availability, survivability, and mission flexibility; to reduce time to deliver new capabilities; to save costs; and to enhance cyber security.\n7) Mobile and Emerging Technology:  Ensure DTIC products, tools and interfaces are compatible with, and actively support customer\/user (DOD, industry partners, academic researchers) devices, operating systems, and browsers.  \n8) Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  An ongoing effort to standardize the way the Executive Branch handles unclassified information under a new document-marking framework. \n9) Public Access \/Open Science (for articles and digital data):  Acquire and disseminate DoD-funded, openly published journal articles, free to the taxpayer, increasing access and encouraging innovation.  Develop a catalog of digital data sets supporting the conclusions of journal articles.\n\nIn response to congressional direction contained within the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), DTIC is piloting the following specific efforts:\n\n- Innovators Data Base:  develop new tools in coordination with the Services and DoD Agencies.\n- Global Research Watch Program:  The goal of the program includes achieving technological decision advantage and attain aided-technology watch and horizon scanning.  This effort will forecast the evolution of known technologies, including the maturation of emerging technologies and new applications of existing technologies, and identify new technologies with disruptive potential.\n- Datasets and Data Repositories:  to develop and maintain datasets and other data repositories on research and engineering activities being conducted within the Department.\n\nAdditionally, DTIC is expanding support and engagement with the newly established OUSD(R&E) organization in order to drive innovation faster:\n- Support the 2018 NDS:  enable the development of lethality, partner engagement, and modernization.\n- Increase support to RDT&E Budget Activity 6.4, Advanced Component Development & Prototypes (ACD&P) activities.\n- The hosting of R&E websites and tools.\n- Establish an information sharing\/repository for the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).\n- Increased knowledge resources focused on R&E Priority Areas.\n\nDTIC's restructured Information Analysis Centers (IACs) drive innovation and technological development by anticipating and responding to the information needs of the defense and broader community.  The IAC Program Office provides core funding, management and oversight of three IACs, which are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields. The IAC multi-award task order contracts ensure that new research, analysis, and development builds on prior investments and puts to work the best practices of government, industry, and academia. The IAC approach was identified as a \"best practice\" by the Director of Defense Pricing and Contracting and the then-Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in a July 2018 memo wherein they promoted maximum use of the IAC contracts across DoD as \"vehicles of first choice.\"  The IACs are structured into three application areas:  Cyber Security and Information Systems, Homeland Defense and Security, and Defense Systems. As part of the Department's acquisition improvement initiatives, the IAC multi-award contracts enhance competition, increase usage of small businesses, and reduce costs to the DoD.  For the last several years, competition inherent in the IAC model has produced savings of 17-25 percent over projected costs, delivering vetted technical expertise to address many of the complex challenges DoD faces.  An independent assessment by the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that the IACs improve affordability, productivity, and standardization within defense acquisition programs. Providing the acquisition enterprise access to thousands of industry subject matter experts, DTIC's IACs performed over $1.9 Billion of customer-funded research and analysis in FY 2018.  The results of the work are a rich source of new material in DTIC's technical repositories and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies, e.g., Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations.  DTIC focuses on three core mission areas (Collection, Dissemination and IACs) and purchases space and shared services (e.g., human resources (HR); financial management; contracting; IT security; communications; and civilian payroll services) from expert and efficient DoD providers. \n\nDTIC recognizes the need to accomplish its mission while increasing the value of its services and products.  DTIC has reduced its headquarter staffing, physical footprint, civilian personnel and support contractors.  DTIC has restructured the IAC program, continues to consolidate its data center, and is an active participant in the Department\u2019s Fourth Estate IT Optimization effort."

In this role, DTIC sets policy for scientific and technical information (STI) exchanges for the research and engineering (R&E) community.  DTIC\u2019s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions to safeguard national security, export control, and intellectual property rights.\n\nRecognizing the common elements across budget justification documents, progress reports, completed work reports, studies, and journal articles, DTIC is mapping relationships to enable users to access the life cycle of research projects from planning to final results.  DTIC employs information technology to verify and validate information submitted and improve user confidence in DoD research documentation.\n\nDTIC is leading the Department\u2019s efforts to implement public access to published journal articles, and digital data from research funded by taxpayers. In this role, DTIC is actively working with partners across the Services, components, other federal agencies and publishers.  These ongoing efforts directly complement and support the Department\u2019s objectives associated with Citizen Science.  Consistent with the Administration\u2019s (Office of Management and Budget) emphasis for open standards and machine readable formats, DTIC initiated the transition from paper and Portable Document Format (PDF) based information to Web Service Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard data submission and machine readable delivery.  DTIC partnered with the OSD Comptroller to collect investment account budget justification documentation in XML and embed this XML in PDF for justification books delivered to Congress.  DTIC employed this same technology in collecting S&T progress reports from the Services and Agencies, and Independent Research and Development (IR&D) data from industry.  DTIC is planning the migration of its completed technical reports collection to the same open standards, i.e., machine readable formats.  \n\nThrough the use of commercial search technology, DTIC provides search capability that links its knowledge of the DoD domain and metadata to support both text searches and data mining.  DTIC continually works to enable additional features within our search capabilities and from commercial partners to improve information discovery and relevance.\n\nDoD conducts science and technology research via the following means:  60+ labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), DTIC\u2019s Information Analysis Centers (IACs), and other contracts and grants.  Spanning over a dozen distinct priority area communities of interest, the results of this work are available through DTIC\u2019s web-based R&E Gateway.  To protect this information, DTIC regulates access through a database of registered users.  In addition, DTIC uses commercial software in compliance with DoD Identity Management Standards to provide instant authenticated access to users of the DoD Common Access Card (CAC)\/Federal Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards, industry PIV-I cards or External Certificate Authority (ECA).  DTIC\u2019s unclassified assets, tools and community interaction capabilities foster innovation, competition and identification of solutions in an access-controlled environment.\n\nFocus on User Communities and Distribution Points:  DTIC supports user communities on the network where they work, i.e., NIPRNet, SIPRNet and public internet, and uniquely provides access controls within unclassified and classified material to protect intellectual property in our search, distribution, and collaboration tools.\n\n- DoD\u2019s RDT&E Enterprise:  As a Field Activity to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)), DTIC\u2019s priority is the RDT&E enterprise, hosting information assets and tools on the NIPRNet (the primary network for the community).  During FY 2019, DTIC is slated to realign under the DoD Chief Management Officer (CMO).\n\n- Warfighter:  Improving coordination between the acquisition enterprise and warfighter communities, DTIC hosts a subset of information assets and tools on the SIPRNet.  DTIC is working to expand the availability of science and technology (S&T) information, to include Independent Research and Development (IR&D), on the SIPRNet.  DTIC is continuing its efforts to establish parity of information and capabilities on applications hosted on both NIPRNet and SIPRNet platforms.\n\n- Industry, Academia, and Citizen Science via Public Internet:  Engaging industry outside the NIPRNet firewall to support acquisition improvement initiatives and encourage the introduction of innovation, DTIC hosts unclassified public information and tools accessible to all users on the Internet.  DTIC provides public access to DoD-funded journal articles and research data, and increases outreach to industry through DTIC\u2019s Defense Innovation Marketplace.  The Public Access initiative adds importance to the public distribution point, to encourage technology transfer of basic and public research to the private sector, and to give an economic boost to small businesses that can use that data to provide new applications to consumers.  Moreover, DTIC activities promote citizen science.  \n\nSummary.  DTIC protects and preserves DoD\u2019s multi-billion dollar investment in research, which empowers the acquisition enterprise through innovative tools, information systems, and decision support capabilities. The efficiency benefits can be enormous.  Each 1 percent increase in the reuse of S&T efforts produces over $100 Million in savings that can be redirected.  Those savings come from elimination of inefficient redundancy (and unnecessary delays), increased community interaction, and ultimately, a more capable military.  DTIC is uniquely positioned to support and to ensure the value of DoD\u2019s R&D portfolio is fully realized."

IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research and Engineering (R&E) focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies.  The IACs create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements.  IAC operations, in concert with 2018 National Defense Strategy objectives, directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key CCMD operational issues such as cyber security, unmanned aerial vehicle visual\/audible signature reduction, and improvements to the ballistic resistance of body armor.\n\nThe IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies. In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing scientific and technical information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges.  Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Technical Area Task (TAT) order processing, Basic Center Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting\/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense R&E community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for their share of direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations.  This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&E community at large."

During FY 2019, DTIC is slated to realign to the DoD Chief Management Officer (CMO).  The PE supports personnel compensation for HQ-assigned civilians, along with related administrative support costs.  This second DTIC PE, established in FY 2017, is designed to track activities deemed as headquarters functions, with no operational efficiencies or enhancement to mission.\n\nThe PE supports the following HQ functions and mission essential activities critical to the success of DTIC\u2019s business operations, and mandated by law or regulation: \n- Activity leadership, strategic planning, and Front Office support staff.\n-- The front office staff represents a small component of this PE.  Most of the specialized functions and skill-sets described below are centralized activities within the PE, yet support the larger organization and its employees.  These activities were consolidated as a means to improve efficiencies throughout DTIC, and are essential to the operation of DTIC\u2019s primary PE 0605801KA.\n-- Reductions to DTIC\u2019s HQ staffing levels continue, reducing civilian full time equivalents (FTEs) below FY 2017-2019 levels. \n- Financial Management and Comptroller.  Provides integrated resource management at the Agency level to obtain, control, and execute budget and manpower authorities to support the organization's mission requirements.  Develops and prepares agency budget documents and exhibits for submission to both OSD and Congress.\n-- Accounting support to DTIC\u2019s mission operations; partners with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to present accurate financial reporting and Fund Balance with Treasury. \n-- Financial Improvement and Audit Remediation (FIAR) activities and oversight in compliance with the Department\u2019s audit goals, objectives, and milestones.\n- Human Resources (HR) Liaison Support.  Provides the DTIC enterprise with payroll processing and \u201cHire to Retire\u201d mission support; oversees and organizes employee training, professional development, and certification programs (e.g., Acquisition, Financial Management, and IT programs).\n-- Coordinates recruitment placement and classification action for the mission areas; liaison to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for HR servicing and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) program maintenance.\n- Mandatory Records Management compliance activities and administration programs.\n- IT Management\/Chief Information Officer (CIO).  Collects, analyzes, and reports information necessary to effectively and efficiently manage enterprise IT resources; CIO functions are performed in compliance with DoD-CIO guidance, instructions and mandates. \n- IT Service Desk\/Local Area Network (LAN).  DTIC\u2019s Service Desk was replaced with an in-house application, developed to manage support tickets and encourage a self-service approach for routine requests.  Office automation activities supports--on a part-time basis--desktop computing customers; resolves IT-related equipment or system incidents; provides assured system and network availability, info delivery, and secure IT solutions to support current and future business and mission requirements.  Beginning in FY 2020, this IT service will be performed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)."

The ManTech program works with DLA\u2019s diverse supply chains to improve manufacturing capability throughout a product's life cycle.  It provides the crucial link between invention and application by maturing, scaling up, and validating advanced manufacturing technology in \u201creal world\u201d environments.  ManTech developments provide a path to low-risk technology implementation for many small businesses and defense unique suppliers as well as depots and shipyards that are critical to DLA.  By anticipating and addressing production and sustainment problems before they occur, readiness levels increase and sustainment costs are lower.  \n\nDLA ManTech is aligned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (IIBM); 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply (MVSS); and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information (ITLI).  \n\n\u2022 The IIBM SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA has supply chain focused execution portfolios for food (Subsistence Network), Castings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology), Forgings (Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology), Batteries (Battery Network) and Additive Manufacturing.\n\n\u2022 MVSS includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements without relying on foreign sources for microcircuits.  This strategic focus area mitigates supply issues caused by the lack of a reliable domestic manufacturing capability to produce products or raw materials needed to build and maintain weapon systems.  The major focus of the program is maintaining a reliable, trusted, domestic source for \u201cnon-procurable\u201d linear and digital microcircuits.  Microcircuit emulation allows the Services to save significant costs by using form, fit and functionally equivalent spare parts rather than redesigning the next-higher-assembly.\n\n\u2022 The ITLI SFA includes efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA, the Military Services, DLA industry partners and DLA customers. It includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) programs.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected up and down the supply chain and across all DLA Customers and suppliers.  A major focus is to transform DoD engineering data from two-dimensional paper-based products to three-dimensional computer based models, and to develop processes to move from \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF files) to technical data files that can interface directly with industries\u2019 engineering systems. The benefits include shorter product introduction cycles, lower set up-costs for parts production and more economical small batch production."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable customer wait times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs. This SFA includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings\/Forging programs and Additive Manufacturing programs. \n\nThe Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is the successor to the Combat Rations Network R&D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program's expanded areas of interest include: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. Desired outcomes include: reduced cost, increased efficiencies, improved processes, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.\n\nThe Casting program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic casting industrial base supporting the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The casting program works with industry, universities, and the Casting Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s foundry industry. The program aligns projects with strategic issues and identified focus areas within the DLA and DoD. Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the casting industry. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are castings. This program includes tasks that focus on developing new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented, most often in conjunction with the casting industry associations. These advancements improve the metal casting supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter. We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DoD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forging program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic forging industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Working with industry, universities, and the Forging Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation\u2019s forging industry. The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas identified within the DLA and DoD. Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the forging industry. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Number (NSN) Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are forgings. This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the forging industry associations. These advancements improve the forging supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DoD weapon systems.\n\nThe Battery Network (BATTNET) program objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. BATTNET conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for specific groups of batteries. BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of Service approved batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) program objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits. DLA is pursing all AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.  The AM effort pursues alternate means of supply for products that are otherwise non-procurable or susceptible to procurement issues due to an unresponsive manufacturing vendor base. The AM effort includes the identification of AM candidates among the population of products that are needed but hard to obtain, costly or have long manufacturing lead times. The AM effort requires management of 3D digital technical and manufacturing data. In addition, the AM effort includes the development of the processes that will tie the designers, engineers, maintainers, logisticians, procurement managers and the vendor base into a seamless AM procurement stream. Potential benefits include products that can address an unfulfilled Warfighter readiness need by reducing production lead times, production costs, storage costs, transportation costs and in some cases fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. DLA R&D will leverage these efforts with Industry, Academia and ongoing Military Service-level agreements (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Department of Energy."

The program will also collaborate with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on their future projects for synergy and as a potential transition partner.\n\nThe Casting program will continue to monitor awarded contracts for projects that research, develop and deploy innovative and technical solutions to ensure a viable and competitive domestic industrial base. These projects focus on improving manufacturing processes and technology that includes robotic and additive manufacturing methods and implementation, new test processes and procedures to evaluate cast materials, computer simulation and modeling to decrease lead-time and increase quality.  The Casting program works with Academia, industry, and industry associations to continually identify future development and technical needs in alignment with the DoD and DLA. \n\nThe Forging program will award contract(s) based on responses to the BAA. The projects included in the contracts will focus on exploring alternative forging manufacturing methods, materials to reduce production lead-time and costs, modeling and simulation software improvements and enhancements and improvements to post processing methods. These projects will be in alignment with the needs of the DoD and DLA aimed and supporting and fulfilling the needs of the warfighter.\n\nThe Battery Network (BATTNET) program will continue, as well as initiate new projects for improving the production readiness, transition, and standardization of soldier and system batteries within the DLA supply chain. The BATTNET program will also leverage new battery manufacturing technologies for the supply chain that have been developed by industry \u2013 advanced electrode production, low cost materials production or recycling, advanced performance cells, and deep-discharge lithium-ion capabilities. The program will continue addressing additional requirements for manufacturing and material improvements in the vacuum electron tube supply base.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) program plans to finance technical efforts from the military services, industry, and academic institutions that have the potential to accelerate the qualification, certification and fabrication methodologies for AM applications and create sources of AM supplies or services for DLA. DLA R&D will identify the best AM applications for castings and forging preforms, achieve precise robustness-repeatability-reproducibility of part fabrication using an AM technical data package in a distributed manufacturing setting and prove the delivery of AM parts to warfighters deployed at expeditionary sea, land or air bases. DLA R&D will fund efforts to expedite creation of digital models and related design and testing information to help establish and expand the DoD digital library of AM parts to solve issues with obsolescence, low volume, long-lead, costly parts. Using market research, requests for information\/proposals, Broad Agency Announcements (BAA), DLA R&D will test the best courses of action for machine learning and artificial intelligent solutions to integrate information from several logistics, engineering, legal, and supplier sources to make efficient AM decisions. These efforts seek to increase the number of AM parts qualified for procurement and achieve savings from the associated lead-time, storage costs, transportation costs, in some cases reduction of fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. Desired outcomes include: rapid cast production and repair of castings using AM, exploration of improved reverse engineering processes for AM purposes, and optimization of polymer and metal AM production to obtain land, air and sea and expeditionary platform spare parts. Overall DLA Enterprise AM efforts will provide alternatives in product realization in order to address unfulfilled Warfighter readiness needs."

Several efforts will address basic design, manufacturing, electrical test and quality\/reliability requirements for establishing a basis for product-oriented developments across the FYDP. MAE will complete and transition 20-Volt operational amplifier emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA's ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. MAE will begin 40-Volt operational amplifier and analog switch projects started in FY2018.  It will continue applying 350 nanometer emulation technology to specific part families for additional NSNs including Dual-Port Static Random Access Memory (SRAM).  MAE will continue to explore using Additive Manufacturing techniques for non-semiconductor aspects of microcircuit manufacturing."

This SFA includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST), the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR), and the Emergent Manufacturing Technology (EMT) portfolios within its scope. \n\nThe Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) program\u2019s focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations for DoD to establish a \u201cknowledge-based approach\u201d to define, communicate, and collaborate on military unique combat uniforms and individual equipment (CUIE) requirements. DLA has the responsibility to manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly shorten the time needed to transition Combat Uniforms and Individual Equipment from development to operational use from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military CUIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based manual environment, into a knowledge-based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end-to-end supply chain.\n\nThe DLIR program researches core technology to improve the quality, speed, and interoperability of logistics data acquisition and management to enable and streamline DLA operations.  DLA must transform business practices and methodologies as the data for weapons systems evolve from traditional formats and delivery methods (such as two-dimensional images and PDF formats) to newer, more innovative methods (such as three-dimensional solid models, object-oriented databases, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 3C standards). This fundamental shift for DLA is driven by the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) approach, which is influencing the way industry is delivering design and development data for weapon systems to the Military Services and the way the Military Services in turn manage and provide the data to DLA. DLA Logistics Operations, DLA Acquisition, DLA Tech\/Quality, and the Defense Standardization Program Office (DSPO) are key stakeholders in the DLIR initiatives to modernize the representation and delivery of weapons systems data.  \n\nThe EMT program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems."

This will be achieved by working with the Services and the DLA C&T industrial base to refine the processes that are used, define item technical requirements, and effectively communicate them to the industrial base.  For example, settings for test equipment would be directly fed into the machine and results would be directly communicated to quality assurance managers.  Test results would be more accurate, traceable and timely.\n   \nA new broad agency announcement (BAA) will be released for an anticipated FY2020 award. The BAA will identify technical opportunities to develop and use digital data for manufacturing modernization.\n\nThe DLIR program will continue with the Connecting the Model-Based Enterprise project and initiate the Logistics Interoperability Technology Extension (LITE) project. LITE will enable improved interoperability between DoD internal and external data sources. For example, LITE proposes publishing logistics documents as data instead of PDF by utilizing advanced content interpretation techniques to extract and model the data inside the document. This approach will be based upon open standards to encourage adoption and integration between DLA and non-DLA systems.\n\nThe EMT program continues to enable DLA's investigation of new disruptive technology advances that may be implemented in the nearer term, without degrading  well established program efforts.

DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military services need to operate \u2013 including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Log R&D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. \n\nThe DLA Log R&D program is organized into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs):\n\u2022 Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (EAMD): R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  \n\u2022 Improving Logistics Processes (ILP): R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n\u2022 Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements (ELR): R&D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  This SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes."

A portion of the MLN budget was realigned to other R&D efforts due to no specific projects identified.  Assessments are currently being conducted for viable R&D projects for the budgeted amounts.\n\nThe R&D Strategic Distribution & Disposition (SDD) Program collaborates with DLA Distribution and Disposition Services to identify capability shortfalls (gaps) that allow the opportunity to address these shortfalls through major applied research efforts and to further improve operational effectiveness and efficiency in support of Warfighter\u2019s requirements. A key objective of the SDD Program is to infuse innovative solutions into distribution and disposition operations that address inadequate legacy capabilities and the challenges of future worldwide distribution, disposition, reutilization, and retrograde requirements."

This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs.

Saving the lead-time allows the agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs. The Program will initiate the Advanced Thermoelectric Technology project to improve the current thermoelectric heater technology so it is more fuel-efficient, has an increased heating range, reduced maintenance requirements, and a longer service life. The Advanced Thermoelectric Heater will replace the existing Space Heater Convective standard heaters currently stocked at DLA, and will provide DoD a single, versatile heater that reduces the logistics footprint and satisfies the space heating requirements of expeditionary forces. Additionally, SCM will support DLA Strategic Materials with one or more cost saving opportunities that exist for DLA via recycling and recovery initiatives.\n\nIn FY18, the AM project will be funded under PE 0603680S \/ Manufacturing Technology Program (ManTech) Project 7 - Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (formerly Material Availability). This realignment will maintain continuity of funding and activity for this program.\n\nERP will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers."

                                                    "val": "The Department finds it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce low volume state-of-the-practice (SOTP) and legacy microelectronics that are unavailable from commercial foundries. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing a guaranteed and Trusted source of supply of microelectronics parts that are essential to combat operations. In addition DMEA provides the rare technology capability to bridge the gap between research and application allowing DMEA to develop, manage and implement innovative microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. This unique research and engineering capability will be leveraged to develop low-volume, high mix fabrication processes for state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies that meet the Department\u2019s performance and reliability needs.\n\nThis is a critical capability in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. Trusted access to SOTA technologies remains a major challenge and therefore it is most important to develop a long term Trusted source for the Department. Threats to Defense Microelectronics include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments, and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned, extended combat use increases their attrition and increases the need for DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities. \n\nMicroelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires low volume SOTP and legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. There is also the major challenge of the ability of Defense R&D Programs to access Trusted SOTA technologies when developing new systems. Consequently, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department\u2019s particular needs of low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. To meet these requirements, DMEA procures commercial licenses to organically produce semiconductor technologies that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department\u2019s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and guaranteed source of these critical parts. This proven model can be extended to SOTA technologies by acquiring advanced commercial process Intellectual Property (IP) and implementing it in a copy exact approach.\n\nDMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication expertise to ensure that the Department can field systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA has established increased ties with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Combatant Commanders to understand their specific threats and opportunities that can be exploited by quicker, more resilient microelectronic solutions. This knowledge of varying requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions \u2013 along with its unique technical perspective \u2013 allows DMEA to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA has years of experience understanding the maturity of US and world microelectronics technology and knows what it takes to adapt the technology for the US warfighter. Based on the results of the knowledge DMEA acquires through technology forecasting, effective modeling\/simulation, prototyping and experimentation, DMEA influences program requirements with recommended improvements and advancements. DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key tool that can be leveraged by the entire US Government in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs. \n\nWorking alongside industry, DMEA utilizes a business model that establishes a pathway that accelerates the delivery of superior semiconductor technologies. DMEA\u2019s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now guaranteed to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. DMEA incorporates commercial technology, along with accelerated acquisition methods to accelerate delivery of needed capability. In this way, DMEA revolutionizes the way the Department leverages commercial technology by exploiting business-cycle opportunities to access these technologies. In this way, the government ensures perpetual access to this technology without bearing the high, upfront process development and qualification costs.\n\nThese Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed IP and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry\u2019s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production order. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners\u2019 valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence necessary to ensure them that their IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.\n\nDMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities."

These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. Extending this mission to include assured access to Trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies will more comprehensively ensure the integrity of microelectronics in all critical defense systems. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies with distinctive resources to meet the Department\u2019s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department\u2019s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, guaranteed and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades to acquire IP and manufacturing capabilities of SOTA technologies, including the CMOS9LP process as well as the technical services to ensure its successful installation via the copy exact model, as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, and the incorporation of the process technologies that are necessary to anticipate the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands. \n\nToday\u2019s weapon systems experience extended field operations and are required to remain in service beyond planned replacement schedules, driving the need for growth in DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, often makes DMEA the only available resource allowing many systems to remain operational."

Under DoDI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical\/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid altered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities available to be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies. Commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies, and is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, along with most other key defense technologies, depend heavily on high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement often translates into significant force multipliers and capability advantages. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors. \n\nThe Trusted Foundry program provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. DMEA will foster all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry, as well as the extension and implementation of key process technologies for trust at DMEA. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, access to Trusted Microelectronics is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place. \n\nWithin the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems. Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents. The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions. This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous. \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow. Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data. Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment. The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."

Currently, Defense Agencies use several different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision-making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.\n\nThe DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies\u2019 financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies, field activities and non-Service organizations across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision-making. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\nThe DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.6 (R12). DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards. The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative sources).\n\nDAI supports the FY 2018- FY 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS Strategic Goal 3, \u201cReform the Department\u2019s Business Practices for Greater Performance and Affordability as well as Strategic Objectives 3.1 \u201cImprove and Strengthen business operations through a move to DoD-Enterprise or shared services; reduce administrative and regulatory burden\u201d as well as SO 3.3 Undergo an audit, and improve the quality of budgetary and financial information that is most valuable in managing the DoD.\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)\/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report (B2R); Procure to Pay (P2P) with enhancements facilitating SFIS\/SLOA and DoD procurement data standards and direct Treasury disbursing;  Acquire to Retire (A2R) (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (H2R) (Time and Labor reporting and absence management only); Order to Cash (O2C); Proposal to Reward (P2R) (Grants financial management and accounting only; and a phased implementation of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GCR) capabilities supporting audit readiness. Future Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA). \n\nDAI is currently implemented at 23 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)). DAI supports over 62k personnel including, 45.6 thousand users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) assertion packages.  In 2017 and in 2018, the system received an unmodified SAE 18 report with no comments. \n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n\u2022 Labor efficiencies (entering data once) and shared across all business processes (modules), workflows and lifecycle in a modern system;\n\u2022 Reduction in contractor support;\n\u2022 Financial visibility (Access to real-time financial data transactions);\n\u2022 Enabling agility and resilience in execution (No silos \u2013 anyone\/anywhere can backfill and work continues);\n\u2022 Retiring legacy systems;\n\u2022 Shared common business processes and employment of Federal\/DoD Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS, SLOA, Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Procurement Request Data Standard (PRDS)); and United \n  States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\u2022 Reducing reliance on custom Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows by leveraging application upgrades \n\u2022 Enhanced Internal controls to ensure accurate data, regulatory compliance and ensuring segregation of duties \n\u2022 Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements; and\n\u2022 Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities.\n\nThe DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition\/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security\/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support. \n\nDLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager, and PMO staff. The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing. The DAI PMO serves as systems integrator. Contracted subject matter experts configure COTS to provide compliant business processes."

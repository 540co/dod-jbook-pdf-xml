The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers of networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats. Further areas of research include Ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground and Soldier portfolios.  The work in this project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this area is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and booby traps. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft, and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems; imaging systems; and advanced radio frequency (RF)\/electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. \n\nWork in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0603270A (EW Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC),  Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize booby traps. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground, Soldier and Air portfolios.\n\nWork in this project is complimentary of PE 0603270A (EW Technology) and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Currently, less than 1\/3 of the total available energy from the fuel is converted into usable mechanical work (propulsion).  This effort also researches and matures thermal management technologies and systems including heat energy recovery, propulsion and cabin thermal management sub-systems to utilize waste heat energy and meet objective power and mobility requirements on all ground vehicles.  Lastly, this effort maximizes efficiencies within propulsion and thermal systems to reduce burden on the vehicle while providing the same or greater performance capability.

Advancing technologies for greater platform capabilities will further exacerbate the problem.  To provide the electrical power required by the Warfighter, new efficient power generation systems for platforms must be created.  As power increases, waste heat increases and must be removed from the platform.  With increased efficiency of the power generation system, less energy will be expended on cooling and can be redistributed to other needs.  This effort will design and evaluate high temperature and efficient power generation components using high operating temperature switching devices and advanced electrical generation components such as integrated starter generators and integrated starter alternators as well as advanced control techniques to make these systems more efficient."

These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)\/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); and traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power\/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners.   The products of this research are required by developers of Army (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones.  These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.\n\nThis project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground and Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe work in this project is coordinated with the Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC PE 063005, project 441); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) PE063004, project 232; Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) PE 063313, project G03; and Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) PE 062705, project H11.  These efforts were previously funded in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork on this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental\/health laws and reducing the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies to decontaminate or neutralize Army-unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants, as well as technology to avoid the potential for future hazardous waste problems.  Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution  as well as developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations.  Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army facilities, lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nTechnologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

These technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.  New and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide.  Efforts focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond.  This project focuses on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of industrial pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination and other waste streams.  Efforts abroad include a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced and cost effective technologies and\/or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste.  Additional work is focused on ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, mitigation and monitoring technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management.\n\nThe work in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This research provides the basis for tools and methods to maintain sustainable lands and ranges and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. The specific end results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual munitions constituents (MCs) and munitions and explosives of concern that minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health and the development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on human health or the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down.  Performing research in genomics analysis, nanomaterial technologies, computational\/molecular modeling tools for toxicity and exposure assessment; impacts of climate change on chemical and biological processes; and attributes of sustainable energy production further reduces the uncertainty associated with both the probability of exposure and the ultimate effect if exposed.  Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis process. Interim products are US Environmental Protection Agency approved health advisories and criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures.  The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits at Army installations.\n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include base camp energy reduction initiatives, elimination of waste streams in contingency operations and toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nTechnologies developed in this project are fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0603728A, Project 025. \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Huntsville, AL, the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA, and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, Warren, MI."

This project provides the Army the technical capability to manage, protect and improve the biophysical characteristics of training and testing areas needed for realistic ranges and training lands.  Technologies within this project enable users to match mission events and training schedules with the resource capabilities of specific land areas and understand how the use of those resources effect mission support and environmental compliance.  The project investigates, designs, and develops novel methods and technologies to restore lands damaged during training activities and allow sustained use of installation facilities and training land resources.  The project supports readiness and full use of training lands through development of threatened and endangered species monitoring technology and management technologies for species at risk.  The project also designs and develops tools and technologies to avoid training restrictions and reduce constraints on training lands associated with invasive species and potential impacts from climate change. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets.  Projects 855 and H71 support the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather, terrain, and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations (includes Deployable Force Protection).  This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs\/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges.  Project T41 investigates and evaluates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions.  Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations.  Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.  \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology) and PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism, Technology Development).  \n\nWork in this PE is led, managed or performed by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.

Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain.  It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification.  This project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather\/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations.  Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.  \n\nThis project supports the Army S&T Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nThis work transitions technologies to the Department of Defense weather and operations modeling community, the US Air Force Weather Agency to improve their operational weather support to the Army PM-MaTIC (PM-Meteorological and Target Identification Capabilities) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for field artillery systems, the Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A), the Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat Organization, the Program Executive Office Aviation, and Tactical Airspace Integration System (TIAS).\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory located at Adelphi, MD and White Sands Missile Range, NM."

This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation.  Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging weapons attacks and enables  maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports Deployable force protection (DFP) efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated in with local communities.      \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground, and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS.

The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scaleability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.

The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, homeland security, and forward base operations.  Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations.  This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians.  Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials.  In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

The human science applied research conducted in this program element provides knowledge-products, methods, techniques, and tools that will enable the Army to: select Soldiers who are predicted to perform well in future jobs; assign Soldiers to Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) and jobs that better match their skills and abilities; retain an effective career force through improved strategies and behavioral incentives to influence Soldiers to stay in the Army for longer periods of time; accelerate the development of leader critical thinking and interpersonal skills through virtual practice so that junior leaders are more adaptable and prepared for uncertain, rapidly changing missions; develop innovative training strategies for complex battle command skills in network-enabled environments; and design training tools for dismounted squad leadership and team maneuver with ground Soldier systems technologies.  Additional research is focused on training techniques and procedures that make it easier for trainers and training developers to rapidly respond to changes in mission or operational requirements and provide a more synergistic training and education process (e.g., automated and improved diagnostics, coaching and mentoring, performance measures, and feedback methods.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Director, Defense Research and Engineering Strategic Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Army Science and Technology Master Plan.\n\nThis project is managed by the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Arlington, VA."

This research provides the scientific basis to recruit, select, assign, promote, educate, train, and retain Soldiers and leaders that comprise a ready and relevant Landpower capability.  The human science applied research conducted in this program element provides knowledge-products, methods, techniques, and tools that will enable the Army to: select Soldiers who are predicted to perform well in future jobs; assign Soldiers to Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) and jobs that better match their skills and abilities; retain an effective career force through improved strategies and behavioral incentives to influence Soldiers to stay in the Army for longer periods of time; accelerate the development of leader critical thinking and interpersonal skills through virtual practice so that junior leaders are more adaptable and prepared for uncertain, rapidly changing missions; develop innovative training strategies for complex mission command skills; and design training tools for dismounted squad leadership and team maneuver with ground Soldier systems technologies.  Additional research is focused on training techniques and procedures that make it easier for trainers and training developers to rapidly respond to changes in mission or operational requirements and provide a more synergistic training and education process (e.g., automated and improved diagnostics, coaching and mentoring, performance measures, and feedback methods.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Director, Defense Research and Engineering Strategic Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Army Science and Technology Master Plan.\n\nThis project is managed by the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Arlington, VA."

Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences. Research is funded in seven projects.  \n\nProject 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Soldiers from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices and predictive models used for the refinement of Soldier protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 870 designs and refines medical diagnostic devices, drugs, and vaccines for protection and treatment against naturally occurring diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 873 conducts research on HIV, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus, preclinical work in laboratory animals including non-human primates to identify candidates for future vaccine refinement, and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for future vaccine trials. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.    \n\nProject 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for resuscitation, life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care, as well as trauma care systems for use by field medics and surgeons. Research focus is on identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury and other blast related injuries, and treatments for ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. \n\nProject FH2 conducts applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy force of Warfighters through the entire deployment life cycle.  \n\nProject VB4 conducts applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate iterative biological tests, computer simulations, and animal studies.  Such refinement efforts using systems biology could ultimately reduce the time and effort invested in medical product refinement. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nProject VJ4 examines over a planned 5-year period the mental and behavioral health of Soldiers to counter suicidal behavior. This work will focus on advancing the understanding of the multiple determinants of suicidal behavior, psychopathology (study of the causes and nature of abnormal behavior), psychological resilience, and role functioning. Work on this project is being performed by the National Institute of Mental Health through extramural cooperative research grants in collaboration with the Department of the Army. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (referred to as preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Research). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and assay refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves preclinical testing in animals. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biome"

Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:\n\n(1) Drugs to Prevent\/Treat Parasitic (living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria\n(3) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control\n(4) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(5) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n\nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity, and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the FDA to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nWork is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the NMRC. The Army is responsible for programming and funding all DoD naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by the WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, MD; and NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories."

Additional activities include refining candidate vaccines for preventing HIV and undertaking preclinical studies (studies required before testing in humans) to assess vaccine for potential to protect and\/or manage the disease in infected individuals.\n\nThis program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between USAMRMC and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. This project contains no duplication of effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.  \n\nWork is related to and fully coordinated with work funded in PE 0603105A, project H29. \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by WRAIR and NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and their overseas laboratories. The Henry M. Jackson Foundation (HMJF), located in Rockville, MD provides support for FDA testing and other research under a cooperative agreement.\n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases to include HIV."

Combat casualty care research addresses control of severe bleeding, revival and stabilization, prognostics and diagnostics for life support systems (predictive indicators and decision aids), treatment of burns, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Clinical and rehabilitative medicine research addresses tissue repair including transplant technologies, orthopedic injuries, eye injuries, and face trauma.\n\nResearch involves extensive collaboration with multiple academic institutions to refine treatments for combat wounds through AFIRM. This project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:\n(1) Damage Control Resuscitation\n(2) Combat Trauma Therapies\n(3) Combat Critical Care Engineering\n(4) Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine\n(5) Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nAll drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with FDA regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.  \n\nPromising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 840.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork on this project is performed by USAISR, the U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Fort Sam Houston, TX; WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD; and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal areas of Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine."

This research focuses on enhanced protection of Soldiers against health threats in military operations and training. Stressors that adversely affect individual Soldier health readiness are identified and studied to refine interventions that will protect Soldiers and improve their health and performance in stressful environments. This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nForce Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:\n(1) Millennium Cohort Research\n(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring\n(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries\n \nPromising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project FH4.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n \nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and USARIEM, Natick, MA. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care."

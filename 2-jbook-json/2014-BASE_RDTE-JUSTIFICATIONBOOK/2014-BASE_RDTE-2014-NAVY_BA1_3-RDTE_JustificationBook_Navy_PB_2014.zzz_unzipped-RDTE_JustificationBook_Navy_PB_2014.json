Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and\nopportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation,\naccelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports\nuniversity research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by\nsupporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career\nAwards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research\ncareers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.\n\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

For many military problems this multidisciplinary\napproach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress, and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The DURIP project supports university research\ninfrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation project complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research\ninstrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The PECASE project supports single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and\nengineers early in their research careers. This project provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national\nsecurity."

In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.\n\n\nFY 2012 program increases provide for an increased number of grants.

The Department of Navy (DON) component responds to S&T directions of the Naval S&T Strategic Plan for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.  It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities.  The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.\n\nThis PE addresses DON Basic Research, which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention.  Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet\/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.  \n\nThis portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.  \n\nILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers\/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition.  Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research.  Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding.  Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Microbial synthesis is the controlled harvesting of organic molecules from biological factories such as E. coli. It is hypothesized that large scale control and manipulation of these efficient microbial factories could lead to increased availability of traditionally rare feedstocks, enhanced sustainability due to the reduced need for organics from non-petroleum-derived feedstocks, and the significant reduction of hazardous waste. \n- Complete the research for Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Simulations of Energetics using a Novel Metadynamics Approach, the goal of which is to develop methods based on a metadynamics approach that can predict important chemical properties of energetic materials and additives that are normally inaccessible to first-principles simulation. The main properties used to evaluate the method are uni- and bimolecular decomposition barriers, oxidation reactions, accelerated aging studies, and crystalline density predictions. The focus will be on complex or novel systems that have previously been difficult to simulate, such as polymer chains, novel high-nitrogen explosives, and organometallic compounds\n- Complete the research for Convergent Synthesis of High Performance Heterocycles via Late Amination, which focuses on convergent synthesis of energetic, high nitrogen CHNO heterocycles using novel energetic synthons to provide increased performance to Navy ordnance. Designing higher heats of formation and higher densities into novel energetic CHNO compounds, while retaining good kinetic stability and safety properties, requires new structural motifs. The 1,2,3,4-tetrazine 1,3-dioxide structural motif, first described by Tartakovsky et al. in the 1991 synthesis of benzo tetrazine dioxide, remains an undeveloped energetic synthon. Although furazano tetrazine dioxide has been known for the last decade, its energetic properties are still unknown.

NO is a critical second messenger involved in the pathophysiology of HBO-induced toxicity. The study examines an implantable NO sensor in conjunction with both traditional and experimental implantable potentiostats. This work will lead to the development of new research capabilities to measure NO production in vivo.\n- Initiate research for Brain and Spinal (and other) Injury Due to Shock Blast.\n- Initiate research for Adaptive Learning Tools Based on Individual Awareness.\n- Initiate research for Warfighter Impact Due to Operational Noise on Navy Ships.\n- Initiate ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length.  Projects selected for FY 2013 will focus on supporting Naval Battlespace Awareness and Intelligent Naval Sensors, Innovative Naval Prototype initiatives in Persistent Surveillance and Sea Basing, and the National Naval Responsibility in Undersea Weaponry."

PDE Constrained Optimization problems arise in many areas of science and engineering, and include problems such as optimal shape design and parameter estimation. While advanced methods for general, non-linear optimization have existed for over a half century, the existence of PDE constraints in optimization problems make the existing optimization methods at best inefficient, and often times infeasible. The goal is to design and analyze new methods which build on previous efforts developed over the last decade, and enable these new methods to be used on problems currently seen in the analysis of naval systems. \n- Complete research for Systems-of-Systems (SoS) Network Analysis where the design of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) requires careful analysis of not only the subsystems, but also the interconnections between the subsystems. These interconnections could possibly correspond to dependencies, communications, shared information, joint operation, or other relationships. This research seeks to develop a theory of SoS engineering and analysis based on graph theory, in particular the theory of time series of attributed graphs, in which the vertices and edges may have attributes (such as readiness levels or communication throughput). This theory will involve both a mathematical formulation of the SoS problem, but also a consideration of how such systems can be simulated, analyzed, and tested. \n- Complete research for Framework for Collaborative Robotic Asset Management where a formalized and extensible approach for discovering, modeling, monitoring, and managing a distributed collection of disparate unmanned systems is defined. This framework will support near real-time system modeling, resource appraisal, and brokering functionalities while using scalable, abstract representations of mission, job, and resource capabilities to provide new levels of intelligent resource utilization to the Navy. The proposed work directly supports research initiatives in the areas of underwater communication networks, minimal operator intervention, intelligent decision-making, and promotes increased situational awareness. This project will present the design of a hierarchical architecture of software components and definition of the elements that comprise the framework Knowledge Representation Scheme in order to provide deliberative management capabilities for a system of collaborating robotic assets. \n- Initiate research on Weak Signature Identification.\n- Initiate research on Advanced Target Classification.\n- Initiate research on Collaborative Unmanned Systems Communication and Asset Management\n- Initiate ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length.

This research advances the state of the art in cavitation prediction, enhancing the understanding of the dynamics of cavitation on control surfaces and propellers though the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Advances in cavitation modeling will be accomplished through the use of a true, two-phase method to model the vapor and liquid as separate fluids rather than as a homogenous mixture, which is commonly used. The final product should be a RANS code useful for predicting cavitation on control surfaces and propulsors of interest to the US Navy, where these predictions may reveal new details of the cavitation sheet break up and associated acoustics.\n- Complete research for Development of a New Vehicle Dynamics-Based Motion Planning and Control Algorithm into the motion planning process. The Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC) algorithm is in development as an efficient Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that generates control inputs and system trajectories. The method is based on sampling the input space at each sample period, and implementing a goal directed optimization method in place of linear programming, nonlinear programming or evolutionary algorithms. This formulation of MPC readily applies to systems with nonlinear dynamics, and avoids the local minima which can limit the performance of MPC algorithms implemented using nonlinear programming. The generic framework will be adapted to enable time and energy optimal trajectory generation for UUV\/USV systems.\n- Complete research for Wall Pressure Fluctuation Measurements in High Reynolds Number Turbulent Pipe Flow.  The objective of this effort addresses the problem of flow noise and flow induced vibration experienced by hull mounted and towed SONAR arrays. Turbulent wall pressure fluctuations at moderate to high Reynolds numbers constitute a primary source of direct flow noise for hull mounted and towed SONAR arrays. In addition, they act as a primary source of radiated noise from undersea vehicles. Furthermore, contemporary finite element structural analysis requires forcing functions as input parameters. The general complexity of the turbulent wall pressure field leads to the requirement for measurements and modeling in order to characterize the field and better understand the physics of this unique class of flows.\n- Initiate research for Vehicle Dynamics and Turbulent Wake Characterization.\n- Initiate research for Hydrodynamic Self Cleaning and Improved Ship Performance\n- Initiate research for Predicting Complex Drag on Towed Arrays.\n- Initiate ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length.

This project's objective investigated the fundamental propagation characteristics of \"broad beam\", or diffused, light sources for N-LOS optical links. N-LOS links provide the benefits of decreased pointing-and-tracking complexity, increased time for link closure, and decreased sensitivity to obstructions. This project studied how the spatial distribution of light caused by scattering, or shaping of the initial source beam distribution, affects the propagation of modulated light in water and optimal source distributions matched to particular undersea environments.\n- Complete research for Turbulent Wake Characterization, where understanding the details of complex turbulent flows around a submerged body is critical for analysis of a propulsor operating in its wake. The inflow characteristics to the propulsor have a significant impact on its performance. This project focuses on predicting the turbulent wake characteristics of a submerged, appended, model-scale body using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. Because the propulsor impacts the pressure field, it has an effect on its own inflow; therefore, the ultimate goal of this project will be to model a propulsor and an appended body in the same domain using LES.  \n- Complete research for Surface Piercing Strut Wake Signature Reduction.  Surface piercing struts in motion relative to water generate a fairly complex wave, producing a rising bow wave in the front of the strut, a cavity on the sides and a wake behind. The size of this white water wake is a function of the strut shape, Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), water salinity, surfactants, etc. The objective of this effort is to understand the bubble generation and transport phenomena, ideally minimizing the bubble entrainment visual detection to a level comparable to the strut itself. Two approaches are investigated: 1) an experimental method that provides insight into the physics of the flow field; and 2) a computational method that validates the existing results and tests new concepts.\n- Initiate research for Littoral Mine Detection and Avoidance.\n- Initiate research for Compact Broad Band Low Frequency Sonar.\n- Initiate research for Advanced Obstacle Avoidance for Unmanned Systems.\n- Initiate ILIR projects that are intended to be approximately three years in length.

It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science & Technology Strategy approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This new strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  \n\nThis PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend.  There are currently five NNRs.\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attracts new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science & Technology Strategy.  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  \n\nThis PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support. Activities in this area also support maintenance of the Science and Engineering Workforce and STEM Education and Outreach.\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs),  S&T areas that are uniquely important to maintaining U.S. Naval superiority. With the designation in 2011 of Sea-Based Aviation as an NNR, there are currently five NNRs.\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attracts new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Funding decrease in FY 2014 is a result of reassignment of funding for the Basic Research Challenge Program into the newly created Research Activity.\n\nResearch planning activities associated with the new Sea Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) will take place in FY 2012-13, with most projects starting in FY2014.\n\nAccomplishments and plans described below are examples for each effort category."

In the past, the Basic Research Challenge Program has been integrated into the legacy R2 Activities to illustrate its alignment with the mainstream Naval research disciplines, but with this update BRC is being identified as its own R2 Activity to call attention to the significance it provides to new areas of Naval importance.  The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement.\n\nIn FY 2014 the BRC is being identified under its own Research Activity to highlight its more prominent role in stimulating competitive multidisciplinary research between ONR departments. BRC research by its nature will likely cross the traditional Research Activity boundaries and produce standout results worthy of specific focused attention."

It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment.  Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia\/industry team.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively."

It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on High Energy Lasers (HEL), Electromagnetic railgun development, high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic\/infrared (EO\/IR) sensor technologies.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.\n-Initiate and conduct lethality testing for notional designs of proposed solid state laser designs. This will include scientific studies of laser erosion, pitting, and ablation of various target materials for improved modeling and simulation, that will support development of the governing technical requirements for a beam director and targeting system capable of performing Navy surface ship self defense missions.  \n-Initiate and conduct studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable for use to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and shall include studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions.

These investments will be considered \"break through\" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for  near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system.\n-Initiate and conduct scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based in a solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance in identified key performance parameters.\n-Initiate and conduct scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent \"safe-arm\" function for the projecting of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.)

Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and\/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. \n\nThe metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational\/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments\/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational\/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass\/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development\/demonstration program."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self defense.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

VCAT will identify and mature critical, relevant variable\/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based TACAIR\/ISR systems. AACUS will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The SBA NNR Structures and Materials program is also ramping up in FY 2013. This program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance\/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability\/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue\/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools.  \n\nBeginning in FY 2014, applied research efforts will begin under the Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Propulsion thrust area as well, resulting in the funding increase in FY 2014.  These efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation.

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas, as well as Future Concepts, Technology Assessment and Roadmapping, and the Littoral Combat\/Power Projection (LC\/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air\/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world, irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States, its allies and its partners; accordingly, this PE has been structured to account for distributed, long-duration operations, including unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect, non-conventional methods and means to subvert, attrite, and exhaust an adversary, or render irrelevant, rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning, investment, and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars, Space, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars, as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval Expeditionary Warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only program elements funding Navy FNC work.

Special emphasis on survivability technologies for the defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs continue to be incorporated into this thrust area.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics.  These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies.

FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&T investments. The program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs): Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance, Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander, Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); High-bandwidth, Free-space Lasercomm; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance. In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense). \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&T investments. \n\nThe program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs): Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance; Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander; Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); High-bandwidth, Free-space Lasercomm; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance. In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense)."

These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered RF spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic\/infra-red (EO\/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.\n\nb) Tactical Networking and Network Control\/Management: Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for C3 information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.  The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.  \n\nEffective in FY 2013, this activity title has been changed from Computational Framework and Methods for Rapid Accurate Decision Making to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.  \n\nThe current specific objectives are:\na) Data Understanding (Formerly: Automated Intelligence Tools): Develop automated, image and signal intelligence understanding tools based on rigorous mathematical and statistical methods that lead to improved change detection, improve object and activity detection and recognition capabilities, context and scene understanding, and inferring of the threat levels to support decision making and persistent and adaptive surveillance.\n\nb) Information Integration (Formerly; Battlespace Sensor and Intelligence Integration): Develop innovative methods for combining traditional and non-traditional data from sensors and disparate sources to provide the best estimate of objects, events, and conditions in the battlespace, in terms of their identity, associated error or uncertainty, context, impact, while inferring relationships and their intentions.\n\nc) Mission Focused Autonomy (MFA): Develop proactive situational awareness and rapid decision making applications and analytics with information PUSH as well as PULL, where joint human controlled and automated analytic processes can collaboratively work together to solve tactical and strategic problems within a multi-level, secure environment.  The MFA system contains the following elements: a) access to enterprise level structured and unstructured data repositories and automated search and discovery of evidence collected across these heterogeneous databases; b) analytics that automate the ability to infer the meaning of evidence that is discovered; c) structured process (hypothesis or argument) that provides context in order to constrain and guide the search and analytic techniques toward goals that are focused on proving the hypothesis right or wrong; d) knowledge repository that maintains pedigree and state of hypothesis satisfaction or refutation; e) Collaborative environment wherein all analytic participants can share the state of hypothesis satisfaction and collectively contribute evidence data to solve the common problem. Develop rigorous and efficient methods for building sophisticated situational models, and develop automated reasoning techniques to categorize and recognize situations under a variety of conditions leading to methods that predict situations under different settings.\n\nd) Resource Optimization (Formerly: Automated Decision Tools): Develop automated decision tools based on mathematically rigorous techniques (e.g., mathematical optimization) that support decision-making to ensure the best use of scarce and\/or expensive resources, achieving optimal allocations for large complex scenarios, including ones that contain uncertainty, in drastically reduced amounts of time.  Develop methods that support decision making in networked sensor management and allocation to ensure sensor assets are deployed in an optimal, or near optimal, manner.\n\ne) Trusted Systems & Networks (Formerly: Secure Sensor Networks): Develop tools and methods to securely handle information without exposing intelligence information about the networks or systems to adversaries. \n\nf) Nanoscale Electronics: To develop novel nanometer scale (feature size near or below 10nm) logic\/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters. Effective in FY 2014, Nanoscale Electronics has been transferred from Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is a result of the realignment of funds and associated Radar and Surveillance efforts to Multi-Source Integration and Combat Identification activity.  These efforts are more closely aligned to the objectives of this activity.    \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is a result of the expanded investment in Mission Focused Autonomy research and the transfer of requirements and associated funding for Nanoscale Electronics Research from PE 0602271N.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals.  Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems.  The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios.  The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Human Computer Interaction\/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays.  A combination of computational, cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms.  Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.\n\nb) Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability: Develop an understanding of the high-level cognitive processes underlying team knowledge processing, decision making and collaboration in order to improve team performance in the autonomous, agile, quick-response combat team of the future.  Develop cognitive, science-based tools, models, computational methods, and human-agent interfaces to enhance team collaboration effectiveness and team performance in complex problem solving scenarios.  Specific objectives include application of discourse analysis methods and other process metrics to assess team performance.  A conceptual model of team collaboration will be constructed and computational relationships among processes and team performance will be developed.  Findings will be validated and demonstrated in operationally oriented testbeds by addressing issues including: rapid team analysis of large volume, uncertain data; knowledge interoperability in coalition ops; measures of team situational awareness; accelerated team synchronization; improved heterogeneous team performance; team collaboration performance metrics; cultural\/language\/experience-free representation and transfer of meaning.\n\nc) Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems: Develop quantitative, executable models, task graphs and optimization algorithms for the organizational design of MOC, consistent with the Navy's New Maritime Strategy. Investigate through modeling and simulation human competency requirements for staffing MOC.  Develop quantitative formalisms for monitoring and assessing the completeness, consistency and accuracy of rules of engagement (ROE).\n\nd) Social Network Analysis: Develop computational models and algorithms for the analysis of terrorist threats and counter-measures, and strategies against terrorist threats.  Develop new computational algorithms for the discovery of missing and hidden nodes in complex graphs applicable to the problem of understanding hidden information in terror networks.  Develop new approaches to calculation of network completeness.  Develop computational approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements using Islamist movements as exemplar data collectivities.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of requirements and associated funding to the Human Factors activities in the Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research PE 0602236N, to provide an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all Human Factors investments in a single PE.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity:"

Technologies being developed will integrate sensors, networks, decision aids, weapons and supporting systems into a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system. This system will operate from the sea bed to space in a Service Oriented Architecture that can be used in a Joint Environment. The current specific objectives are:\n\na) OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance - Develop agile and enhanced tactical sensors for a netted, organically controlled, adaptive sensor field that is capable of detecting and classifying features relevant to other contingency operations, to include organic sensors for small, tactical expeditionary units, capable of supporting the dynamic character of modern operations from the highly mobile to the long-term.\n\nb) Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander - Develop automated tools and software to capture and share information for 'globally-networked, theater-focused' maritime capabilities that will enhance Joint Task Force (JTF) and COCOM ability to execute their intentions.\n\nc) Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks - Develop dynamically adaptive automated software algorithms, protocols, and network management techniques that provide a self-organizing networking capability. This capability will adapt to available links of opportunity at lower echelons and assure priority movement of critical data intra-network and through reachback gateway networks that interface with the Global Information Grid (GIG).\n\nd) Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC) - Develop software for command, control and combat systems that will provide the maritime commander agile and responsive control and management of tactical Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW), and interactions in a net centric enterprise environment.

This capability will enable surface and airborne platforms to exchange very high bandwidth information in Navy Tactical Networks, even with limited SATCOM or RF spectrum access.\n\nf) Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance - Develop analysis tools and software that will provide accurate threat detection by exposing the enemy's vulnerabilities, unmasking their latent networks, discovering their tactics, techniques, procedures, and exploiting in new ways the vast amount of sensor data available today against an irregular threat.  Also develop the following: An electro-optical, infrared and laser Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Targeting (ISRT) optics technology, capable of wide Field of View\/Field of Range (FOV\/FOR) at variable resolution & pointing direction, for installation in mobile platforms without gimbals; a light weight, low cost sensor suite and autonomy algorithms to enable detection and avoidance of all classes of aircraft or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).\n\ng) Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance - Develop algorithms, protocols, and software that will allow the warfighter to: 1)identify and counter real-time threats to the network during mission execution; 2) provide dynamic security management and component management of networked-based assets to support mission execution; and 3) ensure that mission essential capabilities and data exist despite malicious cyber actions.\n\nh) Fast Magic - Develop algorithms and computer and information technologies for Naval forces to respond quickly against multiple threats. Details are classified.\n\ni) NRL Space - Develop vessel tracking fusion algorithms and software to integrate multiple modalities of informational elements, including literal and non-literal information.  Develop algorithms and techniques for handling incorrect, out of sequence and intermittent sensor data to provide persistent situational awareness.\n\nj) Advanced Tactical Data Link - Develop the Low Probability of Detection\/Anti-Jam waveforms and aperture management functions needed to support Advanced Tactical Data Link operations in permissive, contested, and anti-access environments, as well as the real-time network operations capabilities needed to dynamically add\/remove participants, allocate Advanced Tactical Data Link resources to each participant, and add\/remove network partitions in support of dynamic mission execution.\n\nk) Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance - Develop the architecture, algorithms, software and knowledge product tools to allow autonomous control of persistent, tactical networks of sensors; enable ISR assets to provide an \"Information Bubble\" to the mobile user; provide revolutionary sensor and data support to agile tactical missions by anticipating information needs; and provide sensor planning and management relevant to a higher order knowledge model.  This will provide the capability to autonomously maintain persistent surveillance of activities and entities over a region of interest, 24\/7, while providing underlying context for real time adaptive surveillance in support of tactical mission objectives.\n\nThe decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 Activity to a new FNC PE 0602750N to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity:"

This research would extend ongoing research in lightweight robotic arms.\n\nAutonomous Refueling - development of hardware, algorithms, and sensors for hybrid rigid-compliant robotic arms in rapidly changing environments, with specific application to autonomous refueling of USVs, UAVs and UGVs while moving in their environments, advancing beyond the DARPA-sponsored \"Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer Project\".\n\nLow Power Micro-robotics - development of onboard sensors, control electronics, and actuators requiring very low power, with specific application to robotic missions over long durations.\n\nAdvanced Manipulators and Tool-Changers - development of innovative robotic manipulators, tool changers, and associated sensors for challenging robotic manipulation tasks, with specific application to EOD and other robotic missions in difficult environments. This research would extend previous research by providing robust end effector technology and tool changing capability. The overall research outcomes will enhance DoD capability in the areas of explosive ordnance disposal, autonomous vehicle refueling, and innovative robotic arm control. Research deliverables will include hardware development in the areas of lightweight robotic arms, end effector tools and tool changers, and low power electronics and actuators.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles:\n- This effort will draw from current research and push the technology development to the next level to provide a leap-ahead capability in long endurance, deployable, autonomous, robotic air vehicle using fuel cell electric propulsion systems for high efficiency, even in small vehicles, which can provide robust airborne sensor capabilities for submarines, UUVs, small naval platforms and small dismounted units.\n\nUndersea Vehicles:\n- Funding would be used to acquire a medium sized (12.5 inch diameter) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle as an at sea test platform to advance the state of art of onboard intelligent autonomy. This medium sized UUV is readily amenable to vehicle and sensor testing in the wave pool in the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research facility. Subsequently, this would allow at sea testing of State of the art autonomy algorithms (e.g. goal driven autonomy, human cognitive models, Markov decision processes) that allow Navy underwater vehicles to carry out complex mission in denied areas by understanding the environment and adapting mission goals in the context of the commander's intent, with little or no human operator intervention.\n\nAutonomous Systems Integration:\n- To support the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&E)) priorities in autonomous systems, and specifically to advance the state of the art in heterogeneous teams of autonomous platforms, (including sensor networks and mobile communication nodes) that can work seamlessly with the warfighter, funding will be applied to small air platforms and militarily relevant unmanned ground vehicles to integrate sensors and advanced power sources, and to develop the autonomy software that allows the individual platforms to work together, as well as to work at a peer-to-peer level with the warfighter.

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities.  Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. \n\nThe ONRG International Science Program mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet\/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission, funding for the Naval Science Advisor Program ensures the Fleet\/Force (F\/F) helps shape the Department of the Navy (DoN) investment in Science and Technology (S&T), develops teaming\nrelationships to rapidly demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. Science Advisors provide insight into issues associated with Naval Warfighting Capabilities that influence S&T program decision making. The program develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon completion of their tours, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first hand knowledge of the F\/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science Advisor program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals. Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems. The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios. The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Human Computer Interaction\/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays. A combination of computational cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms. Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.\n\nb) Command Decision Making (CDM): This is a new sub-project that consolidates the previous Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability (CKI) and Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems sub-projects. The CDM sub-project is focused at the development of dynamic decision support systems that recognize and are responsive to changing mission and task demands, and adapt to present information appropriately.  This focus is explicitly intended to deliver decision support that will be more timely and responsive to rapidly evolving operational needs.  Current thrusts within the sub-project are to: 1) Conduct research on the application of theory to exploit relevant information for effective decision making; 2) Develop models that are operationally context and task sensitive; 3) Study and apply research for the effective management of highly complex & time critical decision making; 4) Develop and demonstrate decision support tools that address the timely management of risk and uncertainty.\n\n\nc) Social Network Analysis: Develop computational models and algorithms for the analysis of terrorist threats and counter-measures and strategies against terrorist threats. Develop new computational algorithms for the discovery of missing and hidden nodes in complex graphs applicable to the problem of understanding hidden information in terror networks. Develop new approaches to calculation of network completeness. Develop computational approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements using Islamist movements as exemplar data collectivities. The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.\n\nThis FY 2014 activity funding moves from Program Element 0602235N: Common Picture Applied Research efforts associated with the Human Factors activity and is being transferring into this PE0602236N: Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research to provide an easily navigable overview of all Human Factors investments in a single location."

Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort. \n\nThe decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 activity to a new FNC R2 activity titled Force Health Protection.

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO\/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  \n\nAlso included in this PE is the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signatures against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).  NEMESIS technology addresses the need to generate the appearance of a realistic naval force to multiple adversarial surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This R2 activity also appears in PE 0603271N.  For Enabling Capabilities (EC) receiving funding from both PE's the PE 0602271N portion is generally focused on component design and development while the funding from PE 0603271N is focused on integration and demonstration.  \n\nThe specific objectives of the current EC's are:\n\na) Next Generation Airborne Electronic Attack: Develop and demonstrate advanced capability Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) sub-systems (e.g., broadband exciters, power amplifiers, and transmitter arrays) that provide Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), deliver Non-Kinetic Fires, counter Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and provide suppression of Command, Control & Communications (C3) links and data networks.\n\nb) Countermeasures Technologies for Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM) and Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBM) Defense: Improve ship survivability by disrupting the terminal engagement phase of hostile anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, including improvements to both onboard (Enhanced Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program,(SEWIP)) and offboard (Nulka) radio frequency (RF) Electronic Attack systems.\n\nc) Next Generation Countermeasure Technologies for Ship Missile Defense: Develop and demonstrate the fundamental technologies required to conduct next generation, persistent Electronic Warfare (EW) in support of ship, sea base, and littoral force missile defense operations in a distributed, coordinated manner across the entire battlespace.\n\nd) Long Range Detection and Tracking: Develop capability for simultaneous, full volume radar coverage of contacts at long ranges and in a dense contact environment.\n\ne) Affordable Electronically Scanned Array Technology for Next Generation Naval Platforms: Develop and demonstrate electronics components technologies using wide bandgap semiconductors, mixed signal analog and digital, RF, microwave, millimeter wave and associated passive components thus enabling high efficiency transmitter element chains for arrays.\n\nf) Affordable Common Radar Architecture (ACRA): Develop a common, affordable, scalable, open radar architecture that provides affordable capability improvements and addresses total ownership cost challenges for 5 different radars.\n\ng) SATCOM Vulnerability Mitigation: Develop technologies for mitigating SATCOM vulnerabilities using a wideband, airborne and air-to-surface infrastructure.  Technologies include approaches for development of ultra-low cost phased arrays and techniques for mitigating multi-path and scintillation issues on communications links.  Architecture and application development will include surface-to-air communications in the 14-17 gigahertz (GHz) band, and air-to-air communications in the millimeter wave bands.  Additionally, advanced techniques for the use of the ultra high frequency (UHF) spectrum will be developed, which include beam forming techniques and alternative waveform designs that are used to support high bandwidth infrastructure establishment and control.\n\nh) Radar Electronic Attack Protection (REAP): Develop single platform, precision, passive electronic support measure (ESM) and electronic protection (EP) techniques and technology to counter hostile use of modern electronic attack (EA) self protection jammers.\n\ni) Data Exfiltration Nanosatellite Innovative Space Enabler (DENISE)(formerly known as Global Applications for Data Exfiltration(GLADEX)): Develop a nano-sat satellite bus with all its requisite structural, power, thermal, control, and separation subsystems and a nano-satellite compatible payload and ground terminal for monitoring and relay of unattended sensor data for global situational awareness.\n\nj) Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) 3.3: Develop integrated RF communications and RF jammer capability that addresses the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue to enable interoperability.\n\nk) Wide Area Surgical and Persistent Surveillance (WASPS) Capabilities For Tier 2\/3 UAVs:  Develop and integrate enhanced capability interactive autonomous, small, lightweight EO\/IR SAR, SIGINT sensors and integrate into an upgraded, smaller, lightweight, stabilized gimbal designed for 24\/7 persistent surveillance applications.\n\nl) Submarine Survivability-Electronic Warfare: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide submarines an EA capability against surveillance radar systems through EW payloads integrated with submarine masts, as well as networked offboard platforms.  These capabilities will improve the submarine's survivability in a hostile RF environment by providing a non-kinetic strike capability against enemy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors\n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of FNC efforts addressed in this PE to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE."

Also included are modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies.  Efforts will also include the development of optical RF components, infrared technologies including lasers and focal plane arrays using narrow bandgap semiconductors. The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Optically Based Terahertz (THz) and Millimeter Wave (MMW) Distributed Aperture Systems: \nDevelop optically based terahertz (THz) and millimeter wave distributed aperture systems for imaging through clouds, fog, haze and dust on air platforms.\n\nb) Wide Area Optical Architectures: Develop wide area optical architectures for persistent surveillance for severely size constrained airborne applications.\n\nc) Hyperspectral sensors and processing:\nDevelop visible, shortwave IR, mid-wave IR, and long-wave IR hyperspectral sensors, along with processing algorithms to detect anomalies and targets.\n\nd) Coherent Laser Radar (LADAR):\nDevelop and improve components for LADAR applications including fiber lasers, coherent focal planes, and advanced processing.\n\ne) Autonomous and Networked sensing: \nDevelop algorithms and processing that supports autonomous sensing for UAV platforms and that supports networked sensing over multiple sensors and\/or sensor platforms.\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to increased investment in technologies supporting Wide Area Optical Architectures.    \n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is associated with realignment of funds and increased emphasis in Mission Focused Autonomy research in PE 0602235N. \n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. \n\nThis activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Solid State Transistors and Devices: Develop solid state transistors and devices for high frequency analog and digital operation.\n\nb) High Efficiency, Highly Linear Amplifiers: Develop high efficiency, highly linear amplifiers for microwave, millimeter-wave, low-noise, and power applications.\n\nc) Superconducting Electronics: Develop components for RF systems utilizing superconducting and other technologies which are designed to deliver software defined, wide band, many simultaneous signal functionality over a wide range of frequencies, in increasingly field-ready packaging and demonstrate the ability of these components to be combined into chains to deliver superior functionality in conventional system contexts, including, but not limited to, SATCOM, Electronic Warfare (EW), signal intelligence (SIGINT), and communications.\n\nd) Control, Reception, Transmission, and Processing of Signals: Develop electronics and photonics technology that provides for the control, reception, transmission and processing of signals.\n\ne) Novel Nanometer Scale Logic\/Memory Devices and Related Circuits and Architectures: Develop novel nanometer scale (feature size at or below 10nm) logic\/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters.\n\nf) Anti-Tamper: Develope innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. \n\nThe increase of funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the progression of Anti-Tamper Technology research from Basic to Applied Research.  \n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through commercial off the shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.\n\nThe current specific objectives are:\n\na) High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.\n\nb) Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.\n\nc) Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. \n\nThis PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space & Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the \"key transformational capabilities\" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed\nat understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.\n\nMajor efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the BSE, determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.\n\nJoint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)\/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE."

This activity develops observing technologies, models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems and Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that describe the atmospheric environment and its impacts on naval sensors and operations. This activity focuses on uniquely marine aspects of atmospheric science such as air-sea interaction, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, EM and EO propagation, coastal meteorology, Tropical Cyclone (TC) prediction, and the use of remote sensing to obtain quantitative observations of atmospheric properties. Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide NOWCAST and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.\n\nFunding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects increased emphasis across Marine Meteorology efforts including ramp up of some efforts initiated in FY 2012."

This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.\n\nFunding increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to increased emphasis across the spectrum of existing efforts within this activity.\n\nFunding decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic noise shielding and acoustic propagation models."

This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement\/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve ASW, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs.\n\nFunding decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the realignment of resources for higher priority requirements as well as the completion of an effort for the ocean-atmosphere coupled system."

The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document.  This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment.\n\nThis program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect.  Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materiels (including materiels for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics.  This program transitioned from PE 0602114N, Power Projection Applied Research by order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, USD(AT&L), to a separate PE for Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Applied Research and established the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent for DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons RDT&E.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments. \n\nFunding decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-02 ASW Command Level Training and SHD-FY10-02 Operator Training to the R-2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0602750N."

The results of these research efforts in conjunction with embedded state-of-the-art command and operator-level training will facilitate the optimum employment of ASW sensor systems, thus increasing their effectiveness and potentially decreasing the number of sensors used to provide coverage in a given area. This work will provide operational commanders with sensor performance predictions which allow them to accurately judge the performance of those sensors, as well as information with which to deploy them for the greatest operational effect. It will also provide information as to how the performance evolves over time due to effects such as the deformation of sensor locations by currents, sound velocity profile changes, geologic magnetic interference changes, or changes to the optical properties of the water, etc. The effort includes performance predictions for fields of sensors as well as individual sensors themselves and applies to both acoustic and nonacoustic sensors.\n\nWork includes development of ASW sensor and system performance models, and realistic simulations and measures of effectiveness that incorporate and exploit critical environmental knowledge. It includes efforts to couple ocean dynamics and acoustics, characterize ambient noise in the littorals, measure and model acoustic and optical propagation and scattering in complex environments, develop algorithms to extract environmental information from through-the-sensor measurements and quantification and prediction of uncertainty. This information is combined with the operating characteristics of particular sensors (or groups of sensors) to provide predictions of sensor performance in the environment at that particular time and in the future. The predictions will also include assessments of the prediction uncertainty due to environmental measurement and sensor performance uncertainties.\n\nThis work aligns principally with the Assure Access and Hold at Risk S&T Focus Area in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan and contributes measurably to the Operational Environments S&T Focus Area strategic objectives.\n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the realignment of FNC effort to the R-2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0602750N."

Weapon technology focus areas include: Explosives and Warheads, Guidance and Control (G&C), Simulation Based Design, Propulsion, Power Sources, Supercavitation, and Counter Weapons\/Counter Measures. The ultimate goal of this activity is to provide revolutionary capabilities needed to fill Sea Shield and Sea Strike Warfighter Capability Gaps, to accommodate unique payload limitations through the development of modular and reduced sized undersea weapons based on common technology enablers (where possible), to provide improved platform pre-engagement positioning and fire-control solutions for effective weapon-to-target engagement, and provide countermeasures and counterweapons against current and next-generation undersea weapons. \n\nFunding decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the realignment of the FNC effort Torpedo Common Hybrid Fuzing System (SHD-FY11-01) to the SEA SHIELD R-2 Activity in PE 0602750N."

The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet\/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  \n\nThis was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.2 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.2 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.2 PE (0602131M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments were spread across 7 separate 6.2 PEs:  0602114N, 0602123N, 0602235N, 0602236N, 0602271N, 0602747N and 0602782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single place."

All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and, ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&T developer.\n\nThis project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity, as is FNC Management.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.2 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.

The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three \"key transformational capabilities\" required by \"Sea Shield\" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within \"Sea Strike\" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric\/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection\/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization\/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies, including Electromagnetic (EM) Rail Gun for naval weapon systems.  This Program Element (PE) includes elements of the following Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs); Time Critical Strike, and ForceNet.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of four key transformational capabilities required by Sea Strike, as well as technically enable elements of both Sea Shield and Force Net.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These experiments are integrating S&T capabilities directly into current combat systems and SOA C2 systems.  This is a joint series of experiments with the AF and Army including Navy PEO IWS and PEO C4I which will lead to transition directly into the Advanced Capability Builds 12 - 16 for the IWS POR and into CANES for PEO C4I POR.  In FY2012, Navy will continue work associated with the LTEs and perform integrated prototype testing in a more operational environment.\n\n2)  Autonomy and Data to Decision: This Navy effort involves integrated reverie and land scenarios.  The objective is to develop autonomous networked sensor systems (disparate platforms and sensors) that significantly reduce (objective eliminate) human system management and analysis to enable small forces such as Navy reverie expeditionary teams to focus on the execution of missions with significant sensor support. Currently mission execution is limited by the number of people that have to be engaged in sensor management and analysis.  Autonomous Data to Decision capability is also adaptable to autonomous sensor networks in support of forward operating base protection.  More funds in the first year would enable a much richer diversity of sensors, platforms, and automated analysis techniques.\n\nThe decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the migration of these funds to the new PE for FNCs (PE 0603673N)."

Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little or no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  This activity will provide tactical aircraft (TACAIR) and other platforms with effective threat warning and self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual or multi-spectral [Electro-Optic (EO), IR, radio frequency (RF), EM, visual, and acoustic] sensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multi-spectral detection and distribution of specific threat information. \n\nThe Fleet Force Protection portion of this activity includes support to the FNC Enabling Capabilities for: Aircraft Integrated Self-protection Suites; Intent Determination - EO\/IR Enhancements; Proof-of-Concept for Non-lethal Approach; Advanced Electronic Sensor Systems for Missile Defense; Hostile Fire Detection and Response Spirals 1 and 2; Defense of Harbor and Near-Shore Naval Infrastructure Against Asymmetric Threats; Four-Torpedo Salvo Defense; and Shipboard Force Protection in Port and Restricted Waters - Detection and Classification.\n\nThe second major goal of this activity is to develop enabling technologies that will increase the survivability of surface ship and submarine platforms against torpedo threats.  Proposed technologies focus on defeating high priority threats including torpedoes (i.e. straight running, wake homing, acoustic homing, air dropped torpedoes, and salvoes of torpedoes).  Technologies developed will minimize shipboard impact and require no shipboard organizational maintenance.  The Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) provides technologies that enable an ATT to engage threat torpedoes detected by a surface ship towed sensor system.  The ultimate goal is to develop technologies to enable a torpedo defense capability, including ship self-defense against salvo torpedo attacks, to fill the FNC Sea Shield Warfighting Capability Gap\/Enabling Capability: Platform Defense against Undersea Threats. Ultimately the goal is to deliver an anti-torpedo-torpedo for use in defeating a four-torpedo salvo attack against a surface platform.  This activity supports the development of technologies that aid the helicopter pilot when operating in degraded visual cue environments (brown-out).  \n\nThe decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 activity to new FNC R2 activities titled Sea Strike and Sea Shield.  Efforts in these R2 activities have been continued from FY 2012 to FY 2013 into new R2 activities to support all FNC program EC Investments. All efforts in this R-2 Activity have been realigned to PE 0603673N, Future Naval Capabilities, for FY13 and later."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nActivities and efforts in this program address the advanced technology development, test, and evaluation of a dynamic distributed common picture based on emergent technologies that will improve situational awareness across command echelons.  The promise of net-centricity and potential for persistent and pervasive sensing creates greater demand for automated fusion of large volumes of multi-sensor data, techniques to coordinate deployment of multiple diverse sensors, and tailored dissemination of information to support network centric operations.  The focus of this program is to refine technologies that exploit information and networking technology to ensure mission success in unpredictable warfighting environments.  These missions include the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), urban operations, and asymmetric warfare.  To ensure Maritime Domain Awareness, the Navy must be able to collect, fuse, and disseminate enormous quantities of data drawn from US joint forces and government agencies, international coalition partners and forces, and commercial entities.  To further network centric capabilities, this project demonstrates technologies that support seamless information services afloat and ashore; collaborative decision-making among geographically dispersed warfighters; a common, consistent view of the battlespace geared to user requirements; system interoperability with coalition forces; real-time information access with quality of service guarantees; and information assurance.  Technologies of interest provide access to, and automated processing of, information necessary to make decisions that lead to rapid, accurate decision-making and result in decisive, precise, and desired engagement outcomes.  The payoff is access to tailored information in near real time with corresponding increases in speed of command, improved decision-making, and reduction in manpower.  \n\nThe Common Picture Program supports FORCEnet, Sea Shield and Sea Strike pillars and contains investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs):  Combatant Commanders (COCOM) to Marine Combat ID; Combat ID Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Combat ID in the Maritime Domain to Reveal Contact Intent; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; Dynamic Command and Control (C2) for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; High Band Width Free-Space Laser Communications; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance.\n\nIn the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The promise of net-centricity and potential for persistent and pervasive sensing creates greater demand for automated fusion of large volumes of multi-sensor data, techniques to coordinate deployment of multiple diverse sensors, and tailored dissemination of information to support network centric operations.  The focus of this program is to refine technologies that exploit information and networking technology to ensure mission success in unpredictable warfighting environments.  These missions include the OCO, urban operations, and asymmetric warfare.  To ensure Maritime Domain Awareness, the Navy must be able to collect, fuse, and disseminate enormous quantities of data drawn from US joint forces and government agencies, international coalition partners and forces, and commercial entities.  To further network centric capabilities, this project demonstrates technologies that support seamless information services afloat and ashore; collaborative decision-making among geographically dispersed warfighters; a common, consistent view of the battlespace geared to user requirements; system interoperability with coalition forces; real-time information access with quality of service guarantees; and information assurance.  Technologies of interest provide access to, and automated processing of, information necessary to make decisions that lead to rapid, accurate decision-making and result in decisive, precise, and desired engagement outcomes.  The payoff is access to tailored information in near real time with corresponding increases in speed of command, improved decision-making, and reduction in manpower.  \n\nThe Communications Security project supports FORCEnet, Sea Shield and Sea Strike pillars and contains investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs):  COCOM to Marine Combat ID; Combat ID Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Combat ID in the Maritime Domain to Reveal Contact Intent; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; High Band Width Free-Space Laser Communications; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance.\n\nIn the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense)."

The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition programs of record.  This activity area also appears in PE 0602235N.  The aspects of a given EC in PE 0602235N focus on component technology, while this PE focuses on the integration of the components and on demonstrations.  Warfighter Capability Gaps are being addressed by EC's.  Each EC delivers capability-level products to acquisition in a three to five-year effort, and allocates a sufficient investment to ensure a capability is provided.  \n\nThe Future Naval Enabling Capabilities in this activity span across the Information Infrastructure, Applications\/Tools\/Decision Aids, Command and Control, Apertures and Radios, and Tactical Networks and Network Control\/Management, and Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance technology areas.  Technologies being developed will integrate sensors, networks, decision aids, weapons and supporting systems into a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system. This system will operate from the sea bed to space in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that can be used in a Joint Environment.  To accomplish this information integration, efforts are underway to develop rapid, accurate decision making and dynamic, efficient, mission-responsive communications and networks.  Objectives of the current ECs are:\n\na) OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance: Develop a netted, organically controlled, adaptive sensor field that is capable of detecting and classifying features relevant to OCO.  This includes organic sensors for small tactical expeditionary units, capable of supporting the dynamic character of modern operations from the highly mobile to the long-term.  Also, Tracking, Tagging and Locating (TTL) technical development of Quantum dot, Electro-Optic (EO) phase shifted and optical tags for use against vehicles and high priority entities.  Finally the effort includes technical development to enhance tactical sensor communications for a two-way high data rate radio.  Technology allows for automatic adaptation of waveforms for increased network capacity.\n\nb) Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander: Develop 'globally- networked, theater-focused' maritime capabilities to enhance Joint Task Force (JTF) and COCOMs' ability to execute their intentions.  The efforts will support multiple users and multiple roles to access data at any command echelon; provide consistent, qualified, and traceable operational & tactical maritime information across theaters; provide pedigree to provide a clear representation of complex situation and threat elements; supports user interaction across the SOA environment.   The benefits to Naval forces include:  exploitation of navy presence FORWARD to monitor vessels, people, cargo and designated missions, areas of interest within the global maritime environment; access to all relevant databases; and collection, analysis, and dissemination of relevant information. \n\nc) Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks: Develop, integrate and demonstrate dynamically adaptive automated software algorithms, protocols, and network management techniques that provide a rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networking capability.  This capability will adapt to available links of opportunity at lower echelons and assure priority movement of critical data intra-network and through reachback gateway networks that interface with the Global Information Grid (GIG) across multiple security\/routing domains.  Benefits of this effort to the war-fighter include:  timely exchange of situational awareness and C2 information for the Naval Expeditionary Combatant forces; high throughput tactical network access\/delivery, SOA and coalition interoperability through a reliable communications grid; ad-hoc re-tasking and targeting of warriors, weapons and sensors with minimum human intervention; shortened kill chain for tactical engagement missions.  \n\nd) Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC): Develop a capability that will provide the maritime commander with agile and responsive control and management of tactical Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) interactions in a net-centric enterprise environment.  Focus will address classified ASW requirements for command and control at the tactical level.  Benefits to Naval forces include flexible command and control among tactical units with severely degraded communications with the Maritime Operations Center.  \n\ne) High-bandwidth Free-space Laser Communication (Lasercomm): Develop an affordable, reliable and high-bandwidth Free-Space Lasercomm capability which is adaptive and agile in mitigating a wide range of atmospheric and sea surface\/state turbulence, precipitation and obscuration conditions.  Benefits include real-time high-bandwidth direct ship-ship, ship-air and ship-shore links in RF denied environments; enhanced reachback for Forward Operating Bases (FOB) to Marine expeditionary Command Operation Centers (COC) with limited SATCOM access; and biometrics information sharing between Marine Interdiction Operation (MIO) parties.\n\nf) Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance: Develop a capability to provide accurate threat detection by exposing the enemy's vulnerabilities, unmasking their latent networks, discovering their tactics, techniques, procedures and exploiting in new ways the vast amount of sensor data available today against an irregular threat.  Also being developed:  an electro-optical, infrared and laser Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Targeting (ISRT) optics technology, capable of wide Field of View\/Field of Range (FOV\/FOR) at variable resolution & pointing direction, for installation in mobile platforms without gimbals; a light weight, low cost sensor suite and autonomy algorithms to enable detection and avoidance of all classes of aircraft or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).  \n\ng) Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance: Develop a capability to 1) identify and counter real-time threats to the network during mission execution; 2) provide dynamic security management and component management of network-based assets to support mission execution; and 3) ensure mission essential capabilities and data exist despite malicious cyber actions.  Specific efforts include: 1) Next Generation Sensors and Gateways to provide security and control mechanisms to protect networks, data and systems from attacks (e.g., malicious code, data exfiltration); 2) Next Generation Security Protocols and Security Management Protocols to provide hardened, highly survivable, stealthy, reconfigurable overlay of protocols onto networks to ensure network-base configuration and control of security components essential to mission operations, as well as provide data provenance to support dynamic resource management and decision support; and 3) Common Operational Security Decision System to aggregate, correlate, fuse and visualize network security posture information to support integrated warfighting decisions.\n\nh) Fast Magic:  Develop a capability for enabling Information Operations from tactical platforms in a net-centric environment.  Details are classified.\n\ni) NRL Space:  Develop a capability to integrate multiple sensor information from multiple net-centered data stores in a service oriented architecture environment for persistent vessel tracking situational awareness. Details are classified.\n\nj) Advanced Tactical Data Link - Develop a capability to support Advanced Tactical Data Link operations in permissive, contested, and anti-access environments as well as the real-time network operations capabilities needed to dynamically add\/remove participants, allocate Advanced Tactical Data Link resources to each participant, and add\/remove network partitions in support of dynamic mission execution.  \n\nk) Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance - Develop a capability  to allow autonomous control of persistent, tactical networks of sensors; enable ISR assets to provide an \"Information Bubble\" to the mobile user; provide revolutionary sensor and data support to agile tactical missions by anticipating information needs; and provide sensor planning and management relevant to a higher order knowledge model.  This will provide the capability to autonomously maintain persistent surveillance of activities and entities over a region of interest, 24\/7, while providing underlying context for real time adaptive surveillance in support of tactical mission objectives.\n\nThe decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of resources and associated objectives of FNC efforts to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N) to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.\n\nThe following accomplishments and plans are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nWarfighter Sustainment Advanced Technology supports:  Manpower and Personnel, Training, and Readiness; and the Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  It supports Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Programs in Airframe\/Ship Corrosion; Turbine Engine Technologies; Littoral Combat; Sea Base Planning, Operations and Logistics; and Sea Base Mobility and Interfaces.  It develops technologies that enable the Navy to better recruit, select, classify, assign, and manage its people; to train effectively and affordably in classroom settings, in simulated and actual environments, and while deployed; and to effect human systems design into weapon systems.  Other technologies enable reduced operating costs through life-extension of legacy systems and increased efficiency of future propulsion systems and improved diagnostic tools.\n\nWithin the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment supports the achievement of all the transformational capabilities of Sea Warrior and the transformational capabilities of:  Ship to Objective Maneuver and Time Sensitive Strike required by Sea Strike; Littoral Sea Control and Anti-Sub Warfare required by Sea Shield; Compressed Deployment and Employment Times and Enhanced Sea-Borne Positioning of Assets required by Sea Basing; and Battlespace Integration required by FORCEnet.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These technologies will enable advanced capabilities for Navy weapon systems at reduced total ownership costs.  Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) is a DoD\/DOE\/NASA\/Industry program to develop and demonstrate versatile, affordable, advanced engine technologies enabling for increased systems capabilities and reduced total ownership costs. The VAATE goal is 10X improvement in propulsion system affordability (capability\/cost) by 2017, with interim goals of 4X by 2009 and 6X by 2013.  The elements of the capability-to-cost index are increased thrust to weight; decreased specific fuel consumption; and reduced development, production, and maintenance costs for the entire integrated propulsion system.  To achieve these goals, VAATE is organized into multiple product areas. Specifically for the Navy, the focus, as part of the Enterprise and Platform Enablers FNC, is on turbine engine capability enhancements for future and emerging systems.  Technologies critical to Navy fighter jets are being worked, including low pressure turbine technologies for short takeoff and landing; high pressure turbine technologies for higher temperature, longer life; fan and compressor technologies for greater engine robustness and durability, and instrumentation and control technologies for greater engine state awareness and less unscheduled maintenance. Technologies being demonstrated include advanced aerodynamic, material, and structural concepts and emerging active control, prognostic health management, thermal management, aircraft subsystem integration, and information technologies.\n\nThe decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 activity to a new FNC R2 activities titled Enterprise and Platform Enablers.

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This activity also includes development of affordable wideband, high performance Advanced Multifunction Radio Frequency (AMRF) apertures.  A portion of this PE is devoted to mid-term technology development in close concert with acquisition programs of record.  The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition program of record.  In this PE, these Future Naval Capability (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs) span across Electronics, EW, Radar, and Communications technology areas.  This activity also appears in PE 0602271N.  For ECs receiving funding from both PEs, the PE 0602271N portion is generally focused on component design and development while the funding from this PE is focused on integration and demonstration.\n\nThe Navy assumed responsibility for Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) 3.3 S&T by Congressional Mandate.  In FY 2012, JCREW EC program will support JCREW 3.3 Acquisition Program Increment 2 Blocks 1 and 2 and will develop an advanced multi-function communications and EW architecture with supporting component technologies to support prototype development.\n\nThe major objectives of this activity are:\n\na) Affordable Common Radar Architecture (ACRA) - Develop a scalable, open radar architecture that addresses affordability challenges for 5 different radars.\n\nb) SATCOM Vulnerability Mitigation - Develop a diverse, multi-tier communications networking capability for Naval strike forces.\n\nc) Long Range Detection and Tracking - Ability to detect, track and identify (ID) future anti-ship ballistic missiles, advanced cruise missiles, aircraft and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).\n\nd) Affordable Electronically Scanned Array Technology for Next Generation Naval Platforms - Develop and demonstrate affordable components in beamforming element chains for efficient S- and X-Band radar, and EA using highly efficient digital solid state electronics components covering the RF and microwave frequencies.\n\ne) Countermeasure Technologies for Anti-Ship Missile Defense (ASMD) - Improve ship survivability by disrupting the terminal engagement phase of hostile Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles\/ Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASCM\/ASBM), including improvements to both onboard Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) and offboard Nulka RF EA systems.\n\nf) Next Generation Countermeasure Technologies for Ship Missile Defense - Develop and demonstrate the fundamental technologies required to conduct next generation, persistent EW in support of ship, sea base, and littoral force missile defense operations in a distributed, coordinated manner across the entire battlespace.\n\ng) Next Generation Airborne Electronic Attack - Develop and demonstrate advanced capability Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) sub-systems (e.g., broadband exciters, power amplifiers, and transmit arrays) that provide Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), deliver Non-Kinetic Fires, counter Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and provide suppression of Command, Control & Communications (C3) links and data networks.\n\nh) Data Exfiltration Nanosatellite Innovative Space Enabler (DENISE)(formerly known as Global Applications for Data Exfiltration(GLADEX)) - Develop a capability for monitoring and relay of unattended sensor data for global situational awareness.  Benefits include security through encryption, reduced dependence on commercial systems, and reduced collection needs by manned and unmanned in-area assets.  It addresses a shortfall to monitor shipping in territorial waters and the open ocean to combat terrorism, and, enforce criminal law.\n\ni) Radar Electronic Attack Protection (REAP) - Develop single platform precision passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and Electronic Protection (EP) techniques and technology to counter hostile use of modern Electronic Attack (EA) self protection jammers.\n\nj) Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) 3.3 - Develop integrated RF communications and RF jammer capability that addresses the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue to enable interoperability.\n\nk) Submarine Survivability- Electronic Warfare - Develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide submarines an EA capability against surveillance radar systems through EW payloads integrated with submarine masts, as well as networked offboard platforms.  These capabilities will improve the submarine's survivability in a hostile RF environment by providing a non-kinetic strike capability against enemy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors.\n\nl) Electronic Warfare (EW) Roadmap - Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. \n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of FNC efforts addressed in this PE to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

This activity will increase the operational effectiveness of U.S. Naval units.  The focus is on the mitigation of GPS electronic threats, the development of atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision, and the development of compact, low-cost, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS).\n\nThe major objectives of this activity are:\n\na) GPS Anti-Jam Antennas and Receivers - Integrate and demonstrate anti-jam antennas and antenna electronics for Navy platforms for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of electronic threats; to integrate and demonstrate anti-spoofer\/anti-jam processors for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of emergent threats. \n\nb) Precision Time and Time Transfer - Integrate and demonstrate tactical grade atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time; to integrate and demonstrate the capability of transferring GPS-derived time via radio frequency links for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time. \n\nc) Non-GPS Navigation Technology - To integrate and demonstrate inertial navigation systems for the purpose of providing an alternative means of providing precision navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and\/or loss of GPS signals; to integrate and demonstrate a correlation navigation technique using earth maps of high precision (including bathymetric, magnetic and gravimetric data) for navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and\/or loss of GPS signals.\n\nThe increase in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to restoration of previously programmed funding level for GPS and Navigation Technologies research.  FY 2012 GPS research was reduced to fund critical related work in Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) supporting Electronic and Electromagnetic Research program objectives.   \n\nThe decrease in funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the reduced investment in Advanced Technology efforts for GPS and Navigation, and planned increase in Applied Research investment in the Navigation Technology activity in PE 0602271N. \n\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples for projects funded in this activity."

Additionally, demonstrate reductions in size, weight, and power as well as cost (both acquisition and life cycle) by reducing the number of topside apertures needed for communication, electronic warfare, and some radar functions.  A critical tenet of the prototype will be the demonstration of an open architecture so that not only can different companies supply the major components, such as a given receive or transmit aperture, but even down to the subarray and lower component level throughout the life cycle, to ensure continuing competition for maintenance and replacement parts.\n- Continued development of architecture and interfaces and their application to wide-band SATCOM arrays for submarines.\n- Continued development of deckhouse and platform integration strategies and concepts.\n\nSurface Combatants Communications Array:\n- Initiated design effort.\n\nResource Allocation Manager:\n- Continued development of functional queue management software.\n- Continued development of control interface software for the resource allocation manager.\n\nDigital Radar:\n- Completed concept studies.\n- Initiated design effort."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nAs a key component of naval expeditionary forces, the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure, and conduct of maneuver warfare.  Critical requirements in this PE are: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance, training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition, there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies, to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low-, mid-, and high-intensity conflicts in the Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO); methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&I) phases of Naval S&T. As Naval partners, the Navy and Marine Corps S&T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability, such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders helping to meet their emerging challenges by enhancing Naval S&T contributions to the long commitment to the OCO. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.\n\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system\/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. \n\nIn addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Littoral Combat\/Power Projection related Enabling Capability (EC) within the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) portfolio.  The focus of the EC within this PE is technology related to Urban, Asymmetric, and Expeditionary Operations (UAEO).  The UAEO Capability Gap is a science and technology developmental area that is of the highest importance to Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and is one of the highest ranked Capability Gaps prioritized by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).  The UAEO technology gap is being pursued as part of an overall effort that addresses the Sea Strike Capability Gap."

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval expeditionary warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only Navy program elements funding Navy FNC work.  In previous submissions 7 Navy 6.2 PEs and 8 Navy 6.3 PEs funded FNC efforts."

                                            "val": "The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) supports the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps for Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&I) in his mission to define what the Marine Corps of the future should look like in combat development terms.  More specifically, MCWL develops and evaluates future Marine Corps warfighting concepts using an integrated combination of live force experimentation, technology assessment, modeling and simulation, wargaming, and analysis.  MCWL's principal outputs improve current (and inform future) United States Marine Corps (USMC) doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) requirements.  MCWL conducts service-specific experiments and participates in joint service experimentation.\n\nWargames are conducted to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and establish priorities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities.\n\nModeling and Simulation (M&S)-based events allow MCWL to examine capabilities with larger scale venues and forces than is practical with live forces at lower cost in terms of funding and in terms of operating force personnel and equipment.  M&S also enables assessment of proposed capabilities before making investments in costly concept demonstrator technologies required in live force experiments. \n\nTechnical assessments are conducted to ensure that prototype or surrogate technologies are ready for insertion into live force experiments, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies.\n\nLive force experimentation permits exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify DOTMLPF initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  Experimentation encompasses inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  Combat Service Support (CSS) and Force Protection; Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence.\n\nUsing operational forces, MCWL conducts Advanced Warfighting Experiments (AWEs) supported by Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs), Limited Technical Assessments (LTAs), Wargames, and Studies.  These events are planned and scheduled as part of a series of experimentation campaigns focused on one or more central warfighting concepts.  These campaigns are executed under the guidance of the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) and under the auspices of the DC, CD&I.\n\nThe current MCWL Campaign Plan (MCP), formerly called the MCWL Experiment Campaign Plan (ECP), is focused on the challenges associated with the Enhanced Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Operations (EMO), ShipTo Objective Maneuver (STOM), and Seabasing concepts.  This campaign began in FY 2011 and is projected to culminate with an AWE in 2014.  EMO experimentation seeks to capitalize on the enhancements achieved during the previous MCWL campaign, Enhanced Company Operations (ECO), completed in FY 2010, which centered on expanding the combat capabilities of the Marine Infantry Company.  EMO experimentation examines and develops the capabilities of other elements of the MAGTF beyond the infantry company.  Focus areas for this effort are logistics, command and control (C2), and fires, targeting, and maneuver.\n\nThe next MCWL Campaign, beginning in FY 2014, will shift focus to Future Maritime Operations (FMO) line of effort.  FMO will pursue themes of experimentation that support a flexible and sustainable Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB)-sized force involved in immediate crisis response operations across the range of military operations within the emerging \"Single Naval Battle\" concept.  FMO will examine future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment for a crisis response MEB.  The goal of this concept-based line of experimentation is to operationalize the concepts of Operational Maneuver From The Sea (OMFTS), STOM, and Seabasing.\n\nFurthermore, during FY 2010, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) designated MCWL as the lead agency for all USMC Counter Improvised Explosive Device (CIED) activities, thereby expending MCWL's responsibilities in this critical area.  Additionally, MCWL will continue to support the immediate needs of deployed forces and exploit opportunities presented by promising emerging technologies."

The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions provided by the Joint NLW Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document.  This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment.\n\nThis program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation Non-Lethal Weapons (NLWs) and includes performing analysis, technical development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these NLWs.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materiels for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications).  Next-generation NLW systems focus on long-range localized Non-Lethal (NL) effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and\/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.  By order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the Commandant of the Marine Corps was established as the Executive Agent for DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons RDT&E.\n\nThe change in funding from FY2012 to FY2013 is due to a Below Threshold Realignment from PE0602651M for counter-personnel requirements received from the joint community that, based on the research planned to be conducted, more appropriately fit into budget activity 3 according to the FMR definition.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy's Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet\/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  \n\nThis was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.3 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.3 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.3 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.3 PE (0603640M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Navy's 6.3 FNC Program investments were spread across 8 separate 6.3 PEs:  0603114N, 0603123N, 0603235N, 0603236N, 0603271N, 0603279N, 0603747N and 0603782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single place."

They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&T developer.\n\nThis project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.3 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. These projects support funds future capabilities within the Force Health Protection Program, a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for the future Navy and Marine Corps by reducing morbidity and mortality when casualties occur.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The NIH focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort.  This project funds the Force Health Protection program a Future Naval Capability (FNC)that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities and supports the \"Sea Warrior\" component of the Naval Transformation Roadmap, medical logistics aspects of \"Sea Basing\" and expeditionary force medical support associated with \"Sea Strike\"."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nAll Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments.\n\nDecrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-02 ASW Command Level Training and SHD-FY10-02 Operator Training to R2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0603673N."

The results of these research efforts in conjunction with embedded state-of-the-art command and operator-level training will facilitate the optimum employment of ASW sensor systems, thus increasing their effectiveness and potentially decreasing the number of sensors used to provide coverage in a given area. This work will provide operational commanders with sensor performance predictions which allow them to accurately judge the performance of those sensors, as well as information with which to deploy them for the greatest operational effect. It will also provide information as to how the performance evolves over time due to effects such as the deformation of sensor locations by currents, sound velocity profile changes, geologic magnetic interference changes, or changes to the optical properties of the water, etc. The effort includes performance predictions for fields of sensors as well as individual sensors themselves and applies to both acoustic and nonacoustic sensors.\n\nWork includes development of ASW sensor and system performance models, and realistic simulations and measures of effectiveness that incorporate and exploit critical environmental knowledge. It includes efforts to couple ocean dynamics and acoustics, characterize ambient noise in the littorals, measure and model acoustic and optical propagation and scattering in complex environments, develop algorithms to extract environmental information from through-the-sensor measurements and quantification and prediction of uncertainty. This information is combined with the operating characteristics of particular sensors (or groups of sensors) to provide predictions of sensor performance in the environment at that particular time and in the future. The predictions will also include assessments of the prediction uncertainty due to environmental measurement and sensor performance uncertainties.\n\nThis work aligns principally with the Assure Access and Hold at Risk S&T Focus Area in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan and contributes measurably to the Operational Environments S&T Focus Area strategic objectives.\n\nThe FY 2012 to FY 2013 funding decrease is due to the realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY09-01 Drifting System Placement and Source Control Algorithm, SHD-FY09-01 In-Situ Environmental Characterization and System Monitoring and SHD-FY09-01 Mobile System Placement, Source Control, and Pattern Keeping Algorithm to R2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0603673N."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Expeditionary Warfare system components that support capabilities enabling Naval Forces to influence operations ashore.  Third-world nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littoral battlespace.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities.  It supports the MCM-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This activity supports the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related FNCs.\n\nThis S&T investment supports the Joint Requirements Oversight Council of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) validated requirements for MCM.  This S&T investment of mine and obstacle detection provides critical S&T transitions to the Mine Warfare Mission package of the Navy's new LCS.  This investment in MCM S&T is reported as part of OPNAV's annual report to Congress in the MCM Certification Plan.  This plan is reviewed and approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and any deviations in ONR's reported S&T funding for MCM throughout the Future Years Defense Plan must be reported and justified through Navy and OSD.  Further, the MCM S&T investment plan structure is reviewed and authorized by the Navy's Technology Oversight Group that approves ECs, their supporting products, and funding profiles.\n\nThe FY 2012 to FY 2013 funding decrease is due to the realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-03 Integrated Forward Looking Sonar - Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Sonar (FLS-DFSAS), SHD-FY10-03 Long Range LFBB Sonar (AUV Platform Option), SHD-FY10-03 VSW Acoustic Color-Imaging Sonar, SHD-FY12-04 Compact Modular Sensor-Processing Suite (CMSS), and SHD-FY12-04 Mine Drift Prediction Tactical Decision Aid (TDA) to R2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0603673N.\n\nThe FY 2013 to FY 2014 increase is due to the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal program."

The JCD&E Community is comprised of the Combatant Commands, Services, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the National Guard Bureau (NGB), the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The Director for Joint Force Development (DJ-7) leads the joint force development efforts on behalf of the Chairman.  The J-7 staff coordinates all efforts with respect to the JCD&E Community.\n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&E initiatives originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services, and from assessment of Combatant Command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA).  JCD&E project submissions undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Community to confirm suitability for experimentation and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  Preliminary analysis also confirms alignment to the Chairman\u2019s priorities for developing Joint Force 2020 and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) strategic priority areas.  The resulting annual list of project submissions includes concepts for development and experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution.  These efforts are prioritized and approved by the Combatant Command and Service members of the Synchronization Board and forwarded to the Joint Capabilities Board (JCB)\/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) for approval.\n\nJCD&E activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs emphasizing non-materiel solutions through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOT_LPF-P) improvements.  JCD&E tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JCD&E projects address topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JCD&E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards (FCB) who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.\n\nFunding will be distributed to meet requirements, retaining the flexibility to develop field-sustainable joint capabilities that may be required to meet future, unforeseen challenges."

Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects. The Director for Joint Force Development (DJ-7) leads the joint force development efforts on behalf of the Chairman. The J-7 staff coordinates all efforts with respect to the JCD&E Community.\n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&E initiatives originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA). JCD&E project submissions undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Community to confirm suitability for experimentation and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort. Preliminary analysis also confirms alignment to the Chairman\u2019s priorities for developing Joint Force 2020 and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) strategic priority areas. The resultant annual list of project submissions includes concepts for development and experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution. These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Synchronization Board and forwarded to the JCB\/JROC for approval.\n\nJCD&E activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs emphasizing non-materiel solutions through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOT_LPF-P) improvements. JCD&E tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution. JCD&E projects address topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities. In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JCD&E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation. The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.\n\nFunding will be distributed to meet requirements, retaining the flexibility to develop field-sustainable joint capabilities that may be required to meet future, unforeseen challenges."

C4AD conducts interoperability assessments and develops solutions\/recommendations to improve integration of Service, Defense Agency, and coalition systems. \n\nC4AD's Persistent Command and Control Environment replicates an operational environment and provides Combatant Commands, Services, Agencies and Coalition partners at the joint force headquarters level, a laboratory and assessment venue for the warfighter and capability developer to identify and solve interoperability and integration issues with current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities. With this capability, C4AD assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  \n\nBy establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, C4AD is an enabler for the Chairman\u2019s priorities to: pioneer new ways to combine and employ emergent capabilities, drive Jointness deeper, sooner in capability development, move quickly toward Joint information and simulation networks that support secure and agile command and control, expand the envelope of interagency and international cooperation, and promote multilateral security approaches and architectures."

The resulting empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Policy; Joint Doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures; integration of capabilities; and digital interoperability.  JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability to inform acquisition decisions and ensure that Services and Agencies field interdependent and interoperable systems.\n\nThe emphasis of JDAT assessment efforts is the evaluation of C2 Information Systems and Procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data in order to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability. JDAT collects and analyzes data and provides observations, findings, conclusions, and recommendations to identify policy, Joint doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP); and material solutions and products that promote capability improvement.  Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event\/venue exercises."

As part of the CJCS staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues.  JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues."

JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DOD's resource allocation structures. JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (COCOM) and maintains liaison offices at all major COCOM locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the US. It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues and for capabilities development and validation in support of the Unified Command Plan (UCP) assigned missions."

The Automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM DI effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  \n\nFailure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, JS and OSD to efficiently manage force structure resources.  Without continued funding, the current FY13 Forces For staffing cycle will rely on manual, inefficient, less-timely spreadsheets to develop the Assignment and Apportionment Tables.

Further direction by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for an integrated IO test and evaluation capability to assess IO technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.  The 2006 National Security Strategy identifies \"Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\", which involves significant Information Operations (IO) and Cyber operations as a goal.  Through the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and the Integrated Priority Lists, COCOMs repeatedly state the need to expand IO\/Cyber training and education for the developing cadre of IO\/Cyber professionals and provide an environment for analysis, testing, training, combat assessments, and measures of effectiveness for more reliable IO\/Cyber capabilities."

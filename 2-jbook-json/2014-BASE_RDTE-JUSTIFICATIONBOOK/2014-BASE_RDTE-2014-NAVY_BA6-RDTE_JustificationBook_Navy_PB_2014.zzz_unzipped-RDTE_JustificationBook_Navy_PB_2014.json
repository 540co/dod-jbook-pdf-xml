The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.\n\nThe Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&E).\n\nThis project directly supports the T&E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: ALR-67(v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, Advanced 6\" Expendable, Advanced Strategic Tactical Expendable, ALQ-144A, Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.\n\nThis project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD."

The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and offboard EW systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Force, Special Operations, and other EW Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for EW system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past ENEWS' quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield\/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support T&E.  SIMDIS has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) T&E and training ranges to provide visualization of T&E and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within DoD dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard EW systems and tactics against these type threats.  The ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board EW systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), OT&E, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  DT, OT and FOT&E support includes AN\/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship IR signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and PC class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including T&E of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization ships' EW systems in joint allied exercises.  ENEWS assets also support Joint EW exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations."

The reprogramming transactions were compiled from the midyear sweep and internal realignments. The GQM-173A encountered test failures and as a result Milestone (MS) C is now planned for FY 2015. Funds in the amount of $28.987 million have been shifted from WPN (BLI 22800) in FY 2014 to continue EMD in order to complete all tests satisfactorily.  \n\nAir Superiority Target (AST) program: For FY 2012 the Navy share was reduced from the planned amount and shifted to FY 2013 because work on the Pre-EMD contract was delayed by water flooding a Boeing subcontractor.  For FY 2013, increased budget covers efforts on the Boeing EMD contract and also the acquisition of 3 QF-16 targets. FY 2014 will not include costs for EMD contract efforts.\n\nQF-4 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT):  The expenses of this effort are a function of the number of sorties\/target-presentations combined with the quantity of aircraft on the ramp at Tyndall and Holloman Air Force Bases requiring calendar maintenance."

In addition to hardware, software and operational concept development, studies will be performed by an University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development. For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.\nAs to specific harware development, this project includes:\n- Subsonic Targets: Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) (designated the BQM-177A) development.  The BQM-177A primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of the test & evaluation (T&E) of major combat weapons systems programs and of fleet training.  \n- Supersonic Targets: Supersonic Sea Skimming Target (SSST), Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) (designated the GQM-173A), and supersonic high-diver capability development.  The family of supersonic target capabilities represents supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons systems programs in development.\n- TC and TA\/AS development: TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  TA\/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles. TA\/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA\/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems."

This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development\/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).\nConcept formulation for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  \nThe majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.\nThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.\nOutputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, funding for these efforts, except for the Portfolio Management Decision Support System, is being shifted to PE 0605853N, Management, Technical, & International Support, Project 2221, Joint Mission Assessment Studies, to better align these efforts with other Navy capability analysis efforts."

Produce and deliver Analytical Agenda briefings and assessments.\n\nPortfolio Management Decision Support System (PMDSS) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this effort is to refine the system to identify programs as potential candidates for divestment. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. PMDSS will include linkage of programs to N3\/N5 strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on PMDSS by capturing and mapping issues\/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.\nCONFORM - Complete one technical study annually in support of emerging or planned capabilities."

This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower & Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions."

CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA is highly qualified to meet that need."

This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues\/topics appropriately performed by a FFRDC. As a result of the findings and recommendations of the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense Science Board, the Marine Corps refocused the type of support CNA provides.  The CNA maintains a varied number of field representatives for the Operational Forces Commanders and eight (8) program areas for CNA to establish and maintain. The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Policy and Operations; (2) Systems and Tactics; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Infrastructure and Readiness; (5) Manpower, Medical and Training; (6) Resources, Planning and Assessments; (7) Capabilities, Force Structure and Systems and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA). The program continues analytical support for field exercises, Ad Hoc and Quick Response study requirements."

Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes are as follows: \nA) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in the DoN Contract Status Meetings. As part of the CNA oversight process, the Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management. Issues range from reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.\nB) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and the Director, Operations Analysis Division meet several times per month to review the current fiscal year's research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research requirements for the Marine Corps. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with Marine Corps' guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings also serve as the roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.\nC) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as a FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew their contract for an additional five years. The Marine Corps conducts a comprehensive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements, consideration of alternative sources, efficiency and effectiveness, and management and cost effectiveness that contributes to DoN's establishment of criteria and sponsorship agreement."

The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA.  This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur.  The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC.  The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC.  Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes:  A) DoN Contract Status Meetings:  As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management.  B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings:  DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN.  These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN.  The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year.  The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO\/N8 for final review and acceptance.  C)  CNA Comprehensive Review:  Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period.  DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement.  The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&L)."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further\ndeveloped the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. \n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. \n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.\n\nNaval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  \n\nAssessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.\n\nMid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test & Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.\n\nOperations Integration Group:  Classified\n\nCHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS\/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource\/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.\n\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old."

In addition, it develops coherent approaches in coordination with combatant commanders (COCOMs), and appropriate partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative.\n\nThe project scope supports the strategic shift to the Pacific Region with emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Coalition Interoperability.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and Coalition Interoperability requirements. \n\nOngoing cooperative RDT&E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US\/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:\n1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;\n2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;\n3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);\n4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). \n5.

                                            "val": "The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, this project also includes funding for Concept Formulation (CONFORM) efforts.  This is a shift of funding from PE 0605152N, Studies and Analysis Support, Project 2092, Naval Warfare Studies.  CONFORM for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  \nThe majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.\nThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.\nOutputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.\nCapabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)\/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions."

Warfare Systems effectiveness assessment tools will be continually developed and enhanced as required to address future concepts and to incorporate improvements in information technology systems. Additionally, collaboration with aircraft, C4ISR, and networks by continuing dialog and collaboration between NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and SPAWAR systems commands will refine fleet level requirements.\n- Refine platform concept stage cost analysis tools to predict cost better in areas where weight-based algorithms may not be appropriate. It will continually enhance tools to estimate total ownership cost more accurately at the ship and weapons system concept development stage. Conduct cost estimates in support of future concept design exploration, CBA, and AoA efforts. Further develop Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) to accommodate emerging technologies incorporated in future platforms. Develop cost estimating tools which incorporate emerging technologies applicable to future platforms.\n- Conduct future force structure concept formulation. Fleet synthesis and analysis will be conducted, which includes capabilities requirements, platform design and cost and quantitative tracking of the long-term evolution of the fleet as new platforms are introduced and old ones are retired. Among the areas to be examined are interoperability concepts, force architecture impact studies, Long Range Shipbuilding Schedule (LRSS) support, and operational employment concept studies."

A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy.\n-The overall goal is to conduct analysis to support the Navy decisions needed to turn strategy and guidance into the Fleet needed within acceptable risk. METRIC: Risks are balanced\nacross capability that delivers the right capabilities within the resources available to Navy. Navy Assessment Program supports the development of platform specific studies and\nCapability-Based Assessments, an analytical effort resulting in Functional Area Analysis, Functional Needs Analysis, and Functional Solutions Analysis. Efforts provide added\nanalytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities, Integration, and Development System and support warfare integration initiatives.\n-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics,\ncapabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material.\nMETRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling\/methodology to\nsupport analysis. Models\/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints.\n-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not\nlimited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of largescale\narchitecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine\nability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category\nProgram Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research\nperformance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned\nsystems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations\nand uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results.\n-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy\nthat work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports,\nmodel\/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21\nto include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.\n-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or\nsupport capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in war fighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems\nand technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program\nplanning to determine the war fighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities.\nDetermine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment\nand transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy.\n-World Class Modeling (WCM), Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements\nprocess that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support\nanalyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation\nplans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports."

This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft\/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&E requirements."

A major cost of this project is regularly scheduled ship, combat system and remote control maintenance. The remainder of the funds is used for purchase of expendable supplies and routine equipment, fuel and petroleum products, and repairs and supporting services. Most costs are fixed and are associated with simply having this platform in the inventory.\n\nThis project will no longer provide for the maintenance installed Combat Systems of the SDTS (FY14 forward), funding has been moved to the 3206 line."

This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead\/operational ship testing requirements for ESSM TEMP 1471, RAM Blk 2 TEMP 286-1, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, CEC TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN\/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, SEWIP TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), 0686, and LCS TEMP 1695.\n\nLHA 6 acquisition, installation and testing supports all big deck Amphibs and Carriers in the OA configuration as well as RAM BLK 2 OPEVAL, SSDS OA with RAM BLK 2, First non AEGIS SEWIP and ESSM.\n\nThis project provides for the maintenance installed Combat Systems of the SDTS (FY14 forward).\n\nThe T&E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.\n\nT&E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation M&S data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.\n\nThe T&E Enterprise acquires equipment (FY12-14) for installation onboard the SDTS (FY12-15), conducts test and evaluation on the SDTS and lead\/operational ships (FY12-18) and satisfies the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) Testbed Model Development and test execution requirements (FY12-18)."

The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  \n\nAUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water acoustic tracking range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  \n\nMajor test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 \/Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.\n\nAUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier\/marine area include fully equipped machine \/fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track."

These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and T&E aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.  This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers."

Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources. Funding is also provided for Navy support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) program."

Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources.\nThis program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating costs and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation. Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).

This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. \n\n(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability.  The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar\/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations.  It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.\n\n(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections.  The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.\n\n(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program.  The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system\/platform. The program provides design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.\n\n(d) It will support Advanced Technology Concepts.  The program investigates below deck electromagnetic environmental effects.  It also develops the capability to perform remote spectrum and electromagnetic noise monitoring. The program develops the tools and technologies for innovative and efficient spectrum use, and continues the development of relationships between measured EMI and system performance for selected communications systems.\n\n(e) Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request: Combat Enabler for Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan (OEF-A) during FY2013 and Operation Enduring Freedom - In Theater (OEF-T) during FY2014.  Joint Emitters during the continuing OCO operations is a source of debilitating electromagnetic interference to critical United States Navy (USN) Air Operations (OPS) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) assets.

TENCAP responds to the fleet's top, strategically important capability gaps within National systems and is the Navy's primary interface with the NRO and national agencies for the rapid fielding (12-18 months) of cutting edge technology. These include advanced sensors, onboard and ground processing, and integrated information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports operational missions in Enterprise ISR Convergence, Irregular Warfare, Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Information Operations (IO), Anti-Surface Warfare  (ASUW), Mine Warfare (MIW), Environmental Data (METOC), ISR Mgmt \/ Battlespace Awareness (BA). \n\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development use.  Program baseline will also address research and development into Strategic Signals; Undersea and Irregular Warfare; Counter Unmanned Air Systems; Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination; Commercial Navigation Radar Threats; Maritime Intelligence Fusion; Open Ocean Surveillance; Threat Geo-location; and Command & Control.  Link Crimson also supports and participates in Fleet exercises, which provide the venue for testing and demonstrating new prototype capabilities and enhancements. Link Crimson holistically develops warfighting capabilities by synchronizing insertion of technologies with existing Navy, joint, and national agency programs.    Additional detailed information is available at a higher level of classification."

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; C4I; urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS R&D effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items."

The process supports Commanding General (CG), MCCDC and Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command (COMMARCORSYSCOM) by providing funding to priority programs, thus allowing for the examination of concepts and alternatives to support an orderly transition from requirements to initiatives and initiatives to funded programs. This will permit the POM process to focus on activities of evaluating, prioritizing and integrating rather than defining and resolving raw, immature requirements.  \n\nPhase A activities \"jump start\" high priority programs of the acquisition process. Furthermore, since 70% of a program's life cycle cost is determined during Phase A, this initiative puts resources to work where the return on investment is the greatest. Typical studies conducted on Phase A activities include, but are not limited to Market Surveys, Business Case Analysis (BCA), Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis, Life Cycle Cost Estimates, Cost Comparison Analysis, Acquisition Strategies, and Trade-off Analysis in lieu of an Analysis of Alternatives."

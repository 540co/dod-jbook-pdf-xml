Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1.) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo and passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2.) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Increment 3 Theater Capability will identify key touch points between strategic and theater processes and synchronize end-to-end delivery of personnel, equipment and supplies by providing enhanced visibility, collaboration, automated processes, alerts and exception management capability supporting transportation planning and execution for theater force and sustainment movements.  When fully implemented, it will provide opportunities to streamline cargo movement by optimizing capacity and provide complete visibility by synchronizing theater movements with strategic movements."

FY13 funds are for requirements analysis, engagement with individual Combatant Commands (CCMDs), as well as to commence solution implementation and commencement of Global Mission Scheduling (GMS) cognitive based visualizations coupled with automated scheduling to improve air mobility planning.  Further intent in FY13 was to deliver capability to a single CCMD as a demonstration of effective capability.

The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA\u2019s overall Log R&D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment."

DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation\u2019s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are:\n\n1.)  Development of Logistics Data Interoperability & Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and\/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer\u2019s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.\n\nDLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only.

Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  \n\nExtension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA\u2019s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.

Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process and system architecture which will automate and integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DOD cargo during humanitarian\/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and\/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion\/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE."

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations\/analytics, distribution demand forecasting\/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro\/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct \"what -if\" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset\u2019s course, speed or departure\/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery\/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations."

                            "val": "The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market.  The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations.  This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics.  The threats include risks, such as, counterfeiting, Trojan horses, unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecure supply chain.   As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities increases.\n\nMicroelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department.  Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market.  The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels.  As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department\u2019s unique needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns.  In these cases, DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements.  These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department\u2019s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source. \n\nDMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries.  DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market.  DMEA\u2019s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions\u2014along with its unique technical perspective\u2014allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele.  After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects.  DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.  \n\nWorking alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department.  DMEA\u2019s unique flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed.  To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.  These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs.  These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry\u2019s right to bid first on resulting production volumes.  DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components.  If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production.  A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners\u2019 valuable IP and processes.  DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner\u2019s IP is protected from potential competitors.  This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department.  This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs.  As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.\n\nDMEA assists hundreds of programs every year.  DMEA has provided its unique engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase.  This includes the F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs.  DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities."

Although DMEA\u2019s Technology Development budget has remained steady (with a minor economic growth factor) during that time, DMEA\u2019s support for the Department has increased 19.5% per annum over the same period.  In order to fund these steadily growing requirements, DMEA has delayed or foregone many basic infrastructure updates, scheduled equipment replacements, and the acquisition and implementation of the IP that is needed to continue to support the Department.  This increased budget for DMEA Technology Development extends DMEA\u2019s current capabilities to meet the increased demand and keep pace with the rapid pace of microelectronic technologies.      \n\nThe Microelectronics Technology Development and Support funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate the sophistication level or to meet new threats.  These solutions include producing high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements and are not commercially available.  These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance.  DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries.  DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department\u2019s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support.  This includes producing components to meet the Department\u2019s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure updates as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from reverse engineering through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to reverse engineer circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, the development of trusted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and the extension of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of defense customers as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies.  DMEA\u2019s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems.  DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands.  DMEA will comply with DoD Strategic Objective 3.5-2D for any demonstration programs at DMEA. \n\nToday\u2019s weapon systems experience extended field operations and\/or are required to remain in service beyond planned replacements, driving the need for growth in DMEA\u2019s unique capabilities.  This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing these systems to remain operational.  As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset."

This is a critical, time-sensitive requirement to support the DoD's strategy to provide an assured (always available) and trusted source of integrated circuits for critical weapon systems, sensors, and specialized electronic equipment.  The capability enhancement to DMEA\u2019s existing microelectronics foundry will cover a multitude of feature sizes down to 90nm and will be the only assured supply in the world to satisfy critical DOD and US Government program issues for the foreseeable future.\n\nMarket demand for more advanced technology drives the need to make microelectronics with more capabilities in smaller sizes.  The way this size is measured is called \u201cnode size\u201d.  In addition to utilizing various processes, industry constantly develops newer processes with ever smaller node sizes.  The pace of this progress follows what is known as \u201cMoore's Law\u201d: the transistor density of integrated circuits doubles every two years.\n\nMost domestic semiconductor foundries will discontinue low-volume, high-mix integrated circuits in as little as two years because there is little or no profit margin left.  90nm is a key node size for defense applications but industry forecasts show that the commercial industry will substantially decrease the production of 90nm chips by 2014, thereby making acquisition of this essential technology extremely difficult or impossible in the future.  To keep 90nm technology available, DMEA must immediately begin to extend its current capability to 90nm to allow sufficient time to buy equipment, get the processes in place, transfer IP, etc., and ensure the DoD\u2019s ability to use this technology by then.  This will also allow DMEA to purchase used equipment at extremely low prices from commercial sources that are closing or have already closed their 90nm process lines.  Without enhancing the existing foundry at DMEA to 90nm, in four years the DoD will be without a trusted and assured source for repeatable procurement of the state-of-the-practice integrated circuits that comprise a vast majority of the U.S. arsenal\u2019s microelectronics.  This, in turn, will severely impact real-world operations.  In the meantime, if a Trusted Supplier is available to make a requested component, DMEA will utilize that source of supply first.  This enhancement of DMEA capabilities is absolutely necessary to provide assured and secure microelectronics design and fabrication for trusted microelectronics systems and semiconductor components to ensure DOD technological superiority over potential adversaries.\n\nThe current DMEA foundry capability will accommodate node sizes down to 180nm.  Due to physical limitations in the current DMEA lithography and fabrication equipment, the state-of-the-practice processes down to 90nm that need to be incorporated require an expansion in equipment and facilities to handle the smaller node sizes as well as the larger silicon wafers.  This Project will fund expenses associated with planning and implementing the 90nm capability.  Initial costs will include design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities. Further, it will fund the outfitting of the selected property with the required force protection standards, infrastructure, tenant improvements, furniture, and equipment."

Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical\/essential systems need to be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts.  Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities (foundries) is making fabless semiconductor companies the norm in the U.S.  Sophisticated off-shore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to offshore facilities.  These trends threaten the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic on-shore suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies.  These trends are of acute concern to the defense and intelligence community.  Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other defense applications depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.\n\nThe Trusted Foundry program provides the Department and NSA with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet the confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs of their customers.  The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical\/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components.  The NSA Trusted Access Program Office, has successfully contracted with commercial sources to satisfy their state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department\/ and NSA systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues.  Most importantly, Trusted Foundry access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies."

BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:\n- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.\n- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.\n- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.\n- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).\nThe BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business:\n- Financial Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant financial statements and budgetary reports for DoD.\n- Cash Accountability Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant reports of the Department\u2019s cash position to the Treasury.\n- Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services: BEIS will provide data aggregation services, collecting select transaction level data from DoD systems of record to support business intelligence. BEIS will also deliver corporate business intelligence capabilities such as contingency reporting, status of funds reporting and management dashboards.\n- Integration Support Services: This support will be funded by the requesting activity on a fee-for-service basis.\n- Reference Data Services: BEIS will establish a centralized repository for maintaining and exposing referential data to the DoD enterprise. This encompasses the SFIS Library data, Master Appropriation data, Corporate Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) data, and the Transportation Global Edit Table data.\n- General Ledger Services: BEIS will provide general ledger (i.e., financial management information) services for USSOCOM and select Defense Agencies.\nImpact: BEIS will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility to meet Enterprise Transition Plan milestones. It will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports. Through the BEIS enterprise business intelligence capability, DoD decision makers will gain improved visibility into the information they need to make strategic budget decisions. The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). Modernization efforts to accomplish deployment\/implementation of BEIS capabilities are still needed in order to achieve Full Operating Capability (FOC). These efforts have been accelerated to support the Department Auditability goals and targets."

The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database\/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD\/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components\/services: DCD\/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center."

DAI will transform the budget, finance, and accounting operations of the participating Defense Agencies to achieve accurate and reliable financial information for financial accountability and efficient decision making. The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that effectively addresses the requirements depicted in such tools as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a .mil environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 100,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions to support the warfighter.\n\nDAI will implement a compliant COTS business solution with common business processes and data standards for the following business functions:  procure to pay; order to cash; acquire to retire; budget to report; cost accounting; as well as time and labor.  Grants financial management, budget formulation, and re-sales accounting will be implemented by full Deployment. The Defense Agencies are committed to leveraging their resources and talents to build an integrated system that supports standardized processes and proves that the DoD is capable of using a single architecture and foundation to support multiple, diverse components.\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n- Common business processes and data standards;\n- Access to real-time financial data transactions;\n- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities;\n- Standardized line of accounting with the use of Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS); and\n- Use of USSGL Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\nThe system integration services for the DAI will include the following:\nProject management; Blueprinting; Design, Build, and Unit Test; Reports, Interfaces, Conversion, Extensions (RICE); Testing (integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); End-User Training\/Change Management; System Deployment; Conversion; Information Assurance; Sustainment; Data Service; Help Desk Support; Studies and Analysis Support; and Site Surveys."

The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD security mission into an Enterprise System that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. DISS is currently under development and will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), a legacy system. When fully deployed this will be a secure, authoritative source for the management, storage and timely dissemination of and access to personnel clearances with the flexibility to provide additional support structure for future DoD security process growth. When deployed, it will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DoD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies. DISS will provide improved support to the Insider Threat and Personal Identity programs and will be comprised of capabilities that are currently part of the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) and will create a robust and real-time capability for all DoD participants in the Military Departments, and DoD Agencies. It will also include automated records check (ARC) functionality and the creation of an adjudicative case management capability with e-Adjudication functionality. DISS will also provide the following operational capabilities - single point of entry for: personnel security, adjudicative case management, and decision support functionality to all DoD adjudicators. DISS will provide near continuous intra-Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) communications on a web-based enabled platform utilizing a unified architecture with security management.\n\nThe DISS program specifically addresses the requirements of Section 3001(e)  of PL 108-458, Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).  Additionally the DISS program supports the FY 2012 DoD Strategic Management Plan (SMP)'s Business Goal 6: \"Re-engineer \/ use end-to-end business processes to reduce transaction times, drive down costs, and improve service.\""

DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login\/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user\u2019s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document\u2019s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.\n\nDTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011."

VIPS would be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and replace their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS). USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment. VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest. If fully implemented, VIPS would reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations, reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices. GAO reported that better pre-screening practices will yield cost savings and cost avoidance of $83M per year for the VIPS automated elements.  \n\nDue to schedule delays and further refinement of the requirements, VIPS entered into a Critical Change state on May 11, 2011.  The Department of Defense (DoD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated December 7, 2012, cancelled the VIPS program and directed the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to conduct a technology demonstration (TD) of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to inform any future acquisition approach to meet existing requirements."

Future increments will address the full VIPS capabilities necessary to realize the Return on Investment (ROI).\n\nOriginally the VIPS Increment 1.0 was procured under a single contract, competitively awarded to provide both a core infrastructure and business functions to support the accessions process. The VIPS PMO awarded a single Increment 1.0 contract on September 30, 2010 that will initially provide for the design of VIPS Increment 1.0 through PDR. The prime contractor also completed the design, development, and acceptance testing of the ROC prototype. Once the CCR report is completed, the program will seek a Milestone B decision. Following a successful Milestone B decision, the Government will assess appropriate contracting options to complete design, testing, deployment, fielding and training support. The system integration will include management of the technical configuration baseline and sustainment across VIPS. The VIPS PMO has adopted rigorous cost controls using earned value management and a comprehensive risk management program to manage program execution."

It is mandated for use by all DoD Services and Agencies for electronic invoicing by DFAR 252.232-7003. WAWF processes over 86 million transactions worth $301B per year and saves DoD millions of dollars annually in processing cost and avoided interest (over $77.6 M in FY10). WAWF brings together the invoice, the receiving report, and the contract from EDA to provide the accounting and entitlement systems with the three-way match needed to authorize payment. WAWF is also the Enterprise data entry point for the Item Unique Identifier (IUID) and Government Furnished Property (GFP) programs, the source of receipt and acceptance data for Service Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP), and is central for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) enterprise solutions for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Inter Governmental Transfer (IGT). The benefits to DoD are a single face to industry suppliers, global accessibility of documents, reduced need for re-keying, improved data accuracy, real-time processing, secure transactions with audit capability, and faster processing resulting in reduced interest penalties. For vendors, benefits include the capability to electronically submit invoices, reduction of lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contract payment records."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  \n\nWithin the current OUSD(C) environment, the Directorates have a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  This lack of standardization and integration limits the visibility of funding information, introduces manual efforts and undue complexities into the management of budget authority, and impedes the flow of funding documents.  This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."

PBAS is built on mature mainframe technology and programmed in COBOL language.  The risk of using outdated technology increases as the system ages. EFD Phase 2 plans included configuring EFD to support TI-97 funds distribution at echelons III and below \u2013 those currently executed in PBAS-FD DW.  \n\nEFD Phase III addresses a number of residual functions currently performed in the PBAS system involving Trust Funds, Revolving Funds, BRAC, etc. Final determination of which elements of functionality will be incorporated into EFD or another solution will be based on an analysis of both technical and functional requirements. This analysis will occur likely during FY 2012.    \n\nRDT&E funding is requested for FY 2013 - FY 2015 to support development \/ implementation of EFD phases II and III."

The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\n\nThe DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  \n\n\nDAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, \u201cReform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise\u201d.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2012\/FY 2013 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: \u201cStrengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements\u201d. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. \n\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.\n\n\nDAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, OUSD(C) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  \n\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n- Common business processes and data standards;\n- Access to real-time financial data transactions;\n- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and\n- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\n\nThe DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversion, Extensions, and Workflows (RICEW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated ERP system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support."

All selections shall demonstrate and involve a degree of technical risk where the technical feasibility of the proposed work has not been fully established. Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration.

The Rations portion of this business was $702M in FY 2010.  The Combat Rations R&D funding request is .002% of sales. The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR).  The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage; and better ration variety.  CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations.  The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations."

Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are forgings. This program develops methods and technology to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA\u2019s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts:  Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die)."

Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying\/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices."

The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&D groups, is informed of general R&D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available."

                        "val": "Project DX8.  The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $3.929 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique Software Build, Version 8.2.  This software is projected to be available for fielding to the M142 fleet in FY2019.  Software Version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade.\n\nProject 093.  The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers. This project funds software development for the MLRS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $5.000 million for project 093 supports the initiation of software development of an organic tactical software build in support of the interim Fire Control System (FCS) hardware supporting both the current MLRS Fleet (upon upgrade with a modern hardware FCS) and the Army\u2019s MLRS Fleet Expansion effort.  This software development leverages the program\u2019s completed software transition from the prime contractor to the government in FY2016.  This interim FCS solution will be ready to field in FY2021 and the long-term FCS solution is expected to be ready to field in FY2024.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and anticipated to be the first release of organic software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher in FY2021.\n\nProject DZ8:  Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack\/neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24\/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly\/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 300km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was directed in the Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013. The AoA was completed on 30 April 2015 and a letter of sufficiency issued by OSD in September 2015. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) is scheduled for 06 January 2017."

The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers. This project funds software development for the MLRS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nJustification:\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $5.000 million for project 093 supports the initiation of software development of an organic tactical software build in support of the interim Fire Control System (FCS) hardware supporting both the current MLRS Fleet (upon upgrade with a modern hardware FCS) and the Army\u2019s MLRS Fleet Expansion effort.  This software development leverages the program\u2019s completed software transition from the prime contractor to the government in FY2016.  This interim FCS solution will be ready to field in FY2021 and the long-term FCS solution is expected to be ready to field in FY2024.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and anticipated to be the first release of organic software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher in FY2021."

The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $3.929 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique Software Build, Version 8.2.  This software is projected to be available for fielding to the M142 fleet in FY2019.  In addition to addressing software maintenance, Software Version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade."

These efforts are funded via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).\n\nEmerging requirements include maintenance and update to address emerging threats of the launcher organic version 8.x software, reacting to system changes driven by policy and emerging requirements, and maintaining architectural compatibility.  Communication suite changes, munitions updates, and introduction of new munitions require software and\/or hardware updates to ensure full compatibility.\n\nThe enduring organic v8.x software effort is projected for Materiel Release and fielding to HIMARS fleet in FY17.  Version 8.0 will be the initial roll-out.  Version 8.1 will follow in FY18. Version 8.2 will follow in FY19. Version 8.2 will enable portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) launcher when upgraded with the interim Fire Control System solution.

LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24\/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly\/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.\n\nThe Army initially funded the development of the LRPF under PE 0603778A, Proj DZ8.

Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Projects include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction\/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.   \n\nThis supports the identification, study, analysis, and development of fuzing technologies and safe arm devices in production and in the field.  This project will implement technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades.  Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available.  It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects.  The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes, increase commonality of fuze components and requirements.  Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.\n\nThis supports the implementation of IM improvements to the 81mm Mortar Cartridge while meeting all other Key Performance Parameters, namely lethality.  The M821A3 IM cartridge does not meet lethality requirements as outlined in the User Requirements (Capability Production Document (CPD)).  This project is to design an 81mm Mortar (M821A3E1) with pre-formed fragmentation to increase the lethality.  The M821 series of 81mm Mortars is the primary 81mm go-to-war round for U.S. Army and USMC.  This project will provide users a safer round, improving the IM technology and reducing the risk of unplanned stimuli.  This project will also provide enhanced lethality over the M821A3, increasing the capability of the 81mm system.  RDT&E funding is required to develop, test and qualify the pre-formed fragmentation design on the 81mm IM round and ensure that lethality performance requirements are met.\n\nFY 2018 funding supports testing to demonstrate fuze setback spring interface improvements, engineering tests to prove-out the mortar fuze electronics upgrades, studies on medium caliber fuzes to improve throughput and reduce costs, testing to prove-out impact switch upgrades, evaluations on transceiver component replacement prototype devices for indirect fire and direct fire fuzes, studies on second source MEMS-based G-switches for medium and large caliber applications, and 81mm M821A3E1 HE IM Mortar completion of safety\/environmental test and analysis and full arena testing and analysis of test data."

The effort is a continuation of studies, analysis, evaluations, and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field.  This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude component obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.\n\nThe 81mm M821A3E1 HE IM Mortar Project utilizes the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) to conduct loading studies and produce test samples.  The initiatives emphasize improving the manufacturability of the M821A3E1 to minimize unit cost burden in the future.  Follow-on production of the M821A3E1 will utilize the component break-out strategy where the Office of the Project Manager (PM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) will be the Systems Integrator in order to maximize efficiencies."

The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack\/neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24\/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly\/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017."

The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack\/neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24\/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly\/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield.  LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of one missile, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.\n\nFY 2018 Base funding in the amount of $102.014 million continues risk reduction activities through the execution of Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) system demonstration agreements.  LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two contractors through the TMRR Phase. The FY18 funding will be used to continue execution of two TMRR prototyping and flight demonstration agreements, which include a System Requirements Review (SRR), functional reviews, prototype design activities, assessment of future growth capabilities, and initiates the building of eight (8) prototype missiles required to support flight demonstrations.  Funding also supports Government management and Government systems engineering and test support activities."

Two DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) agreements were awarded to support efforts under the Material Solution Analysis (MSA) Phase. TMRR will include two DOTC award agreements for competitive prototyping leading to flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY19. Data from the TMRR phase to include results from the flight demonstrations will support the FY21 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award. EMD will be a competitive award to a single contractor. The EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and limited user test."

The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) integration.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization."

The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) integration.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization."

The Block II program will restore performance lost due to the added weight of safety and survivability equipment incorporated since initial fielding in 2007. Additional objectives of the Block II program include: Efficiently incorporating multiple engineering changes; Accomplishing required mid-life airframe recapitalization; Converging the special operations and conventional Army designs; Establishing a foundation for future block upgrades; and Maintaining the industrial base until Future Vertical Lift (FVL)-Heavy is realized."

As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusions are likely for aircraft not properly equipped. Upgrade of communication and aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army fixed wing requirements for product improvements to support the FW fleet.\n\nIn accordance with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Working Oversight List (dated 26 Jun 15), the Fixed Wing Utility Aircraft (FUA) Program will be required to undergo both Live Fire Testing and Operational Testing. This budget line provides funding for development of the FUA Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), the execution of FUA Live Fire Test & Evaluation (LFT&E) including necessary hardware, and FUA Operational Testing including execution of Initial Operational Test & Evaluation."

As requirements for new avionics equipment continue, aircraft delays and airspace exclusions are likely for aircraft not properly equipped. Upgrade of communication and aircraft modifications will assure worldwide deployability for those required to deploy. This budget line will also provide funding for studies, evaluations and Analysis of Alternatives to support emerging Army fixed wing requirements for product improvements to support the FW fleet.\n\nIn accordance with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Working Oversight List (dated 26 Jun 15), the Fixed Wing Utility Aircraft (FUA) Program will be required to undergo both Live Fire Testing and Operational Testing.

The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6,000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K\/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.\n\nFY 2016 funding provided for dual vendor competitive Technology Maturation\/Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract awards, initial engine design effort, and continued platform\/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2017 funding continues engine design effort and the platform\/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2018 funds the remaining TMRR engine design effort, the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) SSEB for entry into Milestone B (MS B), and concludes the platform\/engine integration trade studies.  In FY 2019, the EMD contract will be awarded to one vendor, and platform\/engine integration design engineering will begin.   FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform\/engine integration A-kit development, resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY 2020. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, provides for First Engine To Test (FETT), and begins physical airframe integration.  FY 2022 funding will provide Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing, leading to an Air Worthiness Rating (AWR).\n\nIf funding permits,ITEP will continue to pursue potential program acceleration directed by the May 2016 AROC."

The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K\/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.\n\nFY 2016 funding provided for dual vendor competitive Technology Maturation\/Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract awards, initial engine design effort, and continued platform\/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2017 funding continues engine design effort and the platform\/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2018 funds the remaining TMRR engine design effort, the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) SSEB for entry into Milestone B (MS B), and concludes the platform\/engine integration trade studies.  In FY 2019, the EMD contract will be awarded to one vendor, and platform\/engine integration design engineering will begin.   FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform\/engine integration A-kit development, resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY 2020. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, provides for First Engine To Test (FETT), and begins physical airframe integration.  FY 2022 funding will provide Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing, leading to an Air Worthiness Rating (AWR).\n\nIf funding permits,ITEP will continue to pursue potential program acceleration directed by the May 2016 AROC."

It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Tiered Readiness by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping, services & infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force. The Army Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss Tracker (AFT) tool is a web-based, automated FLIPL processing and tracking system which provides an electronic FLIPL documentation packet that includes intelligent, digital versions of required forms and allows for attachment of supporting documentation."

As chartered by the Secretary of The Army, LIW will provide enterprise-accepted and trusted information for analysis, aggregation, and reuse in support of the Lead Materiel Integrator (LMI) mission. As an Army enterprise-level repository and retrieval system to facilitate accurate choices and rapid decision making. Specifically, LIW will provide all required data structured in a way that allows for querying and reporting; e.g., equipment authorizations, equipment on-hand, new procurement schedules, RESET production schedules and in transit visibility from origin and distribution to final destination, in support of the information needs of the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other command logistics managers. This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success. ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisfy unique command management requirements.  LIW serves as the single logistics repository which bridges the Army ERP systems (GCSS-Army, LMP, AESIP, GFEBS) with enduring legacy systems. \n\nLOGSA is requesting RDTE funds to develop and enhance the Materiel Common Operating Picture (M-COP).  The M-COP provides interactive views, models, and simulations that directly address Warfighter priorities by giving senior Army leaders the ability to visualize current and future materiel requirements, materiel readiness levels and Warfighter materiel readiness options of the Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) at the installation level.  Data from many agencies is integrated into M-COP views, assisting with information superiority for joint and inter-agency operations (examples:  assisting CENTCOM, NORTHCOM, and FEMA)."

The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army. In August 2011, a sole source contract was awarded to ProModel Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product. The project utilizes an agile development methodology. Versions 1-4 were released on a six-month cadence between December 2011 and April 2013. LMI DST development and sustainment have been transitioned to LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract.  Requirements for additional development were collected from Army Commands and vetted through a General Officer Steering Committee, chaired by Army Materiel Command.  RDTE funding supports future major version releases."

BEC Increment 0 is comprised of the current version (v1.2) of DoD ABIS and the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) which is DoD ABIS v1.3. DoD ABIS supports identity superiority capabilities for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.  DoD ABIS provides matching, sharing, and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-modal biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm, and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making retain, capture, or release decisions.  Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) is the Army Program of Record for the current Army collection capability.  DoD ABIS has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).\n\nThe Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) is the Executive Manager for Army Biometrics and the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by the DFBA Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&T) efforts and oversees the RDT&E program.\n\nJustification:\nFY18 RDT&E funding in the amount of $5.5 million (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) enables the BEC product office to continue the DoD ABIS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  Funding supports a required update to the Search core, transaction manager and the authoritative repository, as well as improved \/ enhanced interoperability with FBI, Department of Homeland Security and other government entities.  Updates to the current Electronic Biometric Transmission Standard (EBTS) which is required in order to enable International Caveat, also improves sharing of data throughout the biometric community.  This funding also supports testing of the DoD ABIS SLEP.\n\nFY 2018 funding in the amount of $0.659 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders."

This upgrade is extremely critical in order to replace end of life hardware and software components, including Commercial Off the Shelf products whose versions currently included in DoD ABIS v1.2 are no longer supported.  The SLEP (v1.3) will extend the service life of the current capability through FY22 and transition to sustainment and will improve interoperability with other government entities such as the FBI, DHS, and Department of Justice.  The Army is currently developing and staffing the requirements documentation and strategy for the next \/ future Biometrics Enabling Capability that will continue to improve upon the DoD Automated Biometric Identification System."

This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  \n\nUpper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM):  Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment.  Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris.\n\nRDP Waveform Suite:  Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts (see below), and implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system improvements.  The RDP implementation allows significant radar waveform improvements necessary to counter evolving threats.\n \nTHAAD\/PATRIOT Interoperability:  Implements improvements to THAAD\/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile battle management and force\/engagement operations.  Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint interoperability. \n \nAdvanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   \n\nTask 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2\/Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3, and Missile Segment Enhancement) to counter emerging Tactical Ballistic Missile threats.\n \nTask 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude Tactical Ballistic Missile Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor.  Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the Radar Digital Processor, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement  missiles.\n\nTask 7:  Software improvements analyze existing and evolving Tactical Ballistic Missile countermeasures and their effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develops concepts to address countermeasure effects and ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.  Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design\/code\/test software implementation leveraging Radar Digital Processor, Modernized Adjunct Processor, Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator and Flight Solution Computer-Redesign processing capabilities.\n\nAssured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT):  Efforts will develop and test the military\u2019s improved Global Position M-Code with Patriot Major End Items (MEI) integrating the improved anti-jamming and secure access of military GPS signals.  This effort meets the requirement for Assured PNT through M-Code as mandated by FY2011 National Defense Act, public law 111-383 & 913.\n\nCombat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the Radar Digital Processor-Capability Combat ID capabilities and additional Non-Cooperative Target Recognition techniques to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.\n\nFlat Panel Array Concept Development:  This task provides studies for initial concepts and performance capabilities related to the implementation of an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) transmitter\/antenna into the PATRIOT radar.  These assessments are needed to refine user community expectations and requirements, and to prepare a viable set of requirements to support a competitive modernization competition.\n\nAnti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense:  Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks.  Builds on an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.\n\nTactical Telemetry Ground Station:  Develops a ground-based telemetry receive station to be deployed with the tactical units and collect PAC-3 telemetry data for tactical engagements.   This data will be used to assess missile and system effectiveness in tactical environments against real-world threats, and will support the development of operational improvements (Firing Doctrine and other system settings) and system software improvements to mitigate stressing threat behaviors.\n\nU.S. Government and contractor support for PIP efforts."

JLENS participation in the OPEX was to allow for a combatant commander\u2019s operational assessment of JLENS capabilities to \"inform a future decision for enduring operational employment\". \n\nOperational Control of JLENS for the OPEX was transferred to the NORAD\/NORTHCOM Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC) on 15 October 2015.  Due to a tether break accident on 28 October 2015 resulting in the loss of the Fire Control System aerostat, significant damage to the Radar and Mobile Mooring Station, the Commander NORAD\/NORTHCOM suspended JLENS participation in the OPEX pending results from accident investigations and Failure Review Board recommendations.  JLENS participation in the OPEX was terminated per an Under Secretary for Defense Policy decision memorandum dated 15 June 2016.  In accordance with Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) direction, JLENS equipment supporting the OPEX was packed and stored at the APG sites effective 21 June 2016, pending higher headquarters decision on the future of the JLENS program. Courses of action under consideration are staging JLENS equipment in indefinite storage to meet potential future contingency requirements; and termination of the JLENS program with disposition\/demilitarization of JLENS equipment."

There are two developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently FY18 and beyond:  Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) (project code EF7) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I) (project code EF8).  The development on the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6) will be completed in FY17.\n\nJoint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. \n\nPocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD. \n\nAFATDS 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS program currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army\u2019s Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction."

JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. \n\nJADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. \n\nJADOCS fires and targeting capabilities will migrate to AFATDS v 7.1.  JADOCS v2.0 will be sustained throughout the force until AFATDS 7.1 is fielded and satisfies the requirement for JADOCS fires and targeting functionality.  JADOCS v 2.0 software is being developed by CECOM Life Cycle Management Command, Software Engineering Center (SEC).\n\nThere is no FY18 RDTE funding request."

Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PFED Increment II will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PFED Increment II software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.\n\nPM Mission Command will continue to manage future capability blocks of software development. PM Mission Command will continue to coordinate with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above."

                        "val": "This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nStryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and ECP 2 efforts. ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration a suite of complementary lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).\n\nLight Armored Vehicle improvement program will design, test and modify two Light Armored Vehicles (LAV-25A2s) for Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) to inform operational concepts for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in support of Global Response Force early entry operations.  This will directly support the expeditionary maneuver excursion that will be conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps in FY17-18.\n\nM113 improvements will develop an affordable solution for upgrading the M113s to enhance protection, survivability, mobility and power generation to support the current and future network systems.  This will provide the necessary enhancements to the M113 capability for Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) units with priority to the forward deployed units and equipment sets.  The Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program will replace all M113 family of vehicles in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT).\n\nThe Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of ECPs that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle. The current M88A2 is not capable of single vehicle recovery of the M1A2 SEPv2 in all situations and the M1A2 SEPv3 fielding in FY20 will further exacerbate the recovery problem."

The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles.  The HERCULES provides Single Vehicle Recovery of the 70 Ton Abrams tank.\n\nThe 1998 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) required Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of a 70T Main Battle Tank.  The Abrams SEPv2 CURRENTLY exceeds the 70T ORD requirement and the M88A2 is unable to safely perform SVR of MBT in all conditions.  SEPv3 further exacerbates the problem.  Current doctrine requires a holdback vehicle for loads > 70T and the M88A2 multi-vehicle towing is not resourced or trained.  The approved CPD as of 10 Jan 2017, requires the Improved M88A2 (M88A2E1) to enable \u201cSingle Vehicle Recovery of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.\u201d\n\nTechnical assessments and analyses will be used to clarify the capability gap (Single Vehicle Recovery), evaluate design solution concepts, and inform key program decision points.  The goal of the assessments will be to provide confidence to Army Leadership that a M88A2E1 solution is affordable, achievable, and technologically feasible with manageable risk. Limited analyses, conducted to date, suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, transmission, hydraulics and potentially powertrain are required. \n\nFY 2018 Base dollars in the amount of $5 million will be used to support M88A2 baseline testing and conduct sub-system trade analyses.  FY 2018 Base dollars will also be used for Program Management Support and Contractor and Government Systems Engineering for labor and travel to effectively manage the program."

This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY2011.\n\nThe Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development, and technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank."

To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army existing programs of record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army program of records, including continued SINCGARS integration and Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command \u2013 Platform (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP 2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY 2017.   The Bradley M2A4 Vehicle is the combination of the M2A3 Base Vehicle with ECP 1 and ECP 2 components installed and integrated.   Additionally, a follow on Engineering Change Proposal to ECP 2, ECP 2b integrates Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) to replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability along with other technology upgrades and insertions (i.e. laser pointing, color camera, laser range finder, Vehicular Integration for Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and, Reconnaissance\/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY) architecture compliance, etc). Product Manager Bradley will execute a Non Development Initiative (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. A separate integration effort begins in FY 2018 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats."

Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and ECP 2 efforts. ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs)."

In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  \n\nOn 2 July 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) Lethality effort.  ONS Lethality Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development\/Test Support were awarded in Jan 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The ONS Lethality Production\/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.\n\nThe ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, common masted sensor, improved target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the ECP2 effort was received in a 30 September 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM)."

The PIM improvement program is intended to address the current Howitzer capability gap based on a capability needs assessment performed by the user community to restore indirect fires support overmatch to the US Army.  This effort will evaluate developing technologies to determine which configuration will add optimal value to the Army.   This effort may include but is not limited to the integration of a new cannon, gun mount, gun drive systems, fire control systems and autoloader into the M109A7 Howitzer.  Analysis will be required to evaluate the impact of the new cannon technology on current platform chassis, cab, suspension, mobility, and electronic architecture.  This evaluation will be the foundation for this Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and further inform the level of effort needed to integrate this capability into the current SPHS.  This program is a new start in FY18."

Sensors\/payloads include an Electro-Optical\/Infrared\/Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD), Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Hellfire missiles; providing a near all-weather mission capability. MQ-1C Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.\n\nThe MQ-1C Gray Eagle Modification\/Product Improvement Program (PIP) funding is required for the implementation of the Alternate Munition integration, Global Positioning System (GPS) Denied, an electronic warfare capability, Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) improvements, and Ground Based Sense And Avoid (GBSAA) Block II.\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Aircraft Modification\/Product Improvement funding of $39.358 million will support the development required to integrate Alternate Munition, GPS Denied, and UGCS Improvements into the MQ-1C Gray Eagle product. GBSAA Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) will provide development, integration and testing for Block II. This moves the GBSAA display into the UGCS to provide information to the aircraft operator to include maneuver recommendations necessary to avoid intruder aircraft.  Adds capabilities to minimize operator workload and combines two operator screens onto one display to shrink footprint. Block II decreases operational and sustainment costs, operator workload, hardware\/software costs, increases system safety, and provides full materiel release for soldier operation."

Sensors\/payloads include an Electro-Optical\/Infrared\/Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD), Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and HELLFIRE missiles; providing a near all-weather mission capability. MQ-1C Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.\n\nThe MQ-1C Gray Eagle Modification\/Product Improvement Program (PIP) funding is required for the implementation of the Alternate Munition capability, Global Positioning System (GPS) Denied which is an electronic warfare capability, Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) improvements, and Ground Based Sense And Avoid (GBSAA) Block II.\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Aircraft Modification\/Product Improvement funding of $39.358 million will support the development required to integrate Alternate Munition, GPS Denied, and UGCS Improvements for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle product.  GBSAA RDTE will provide development, integration and testing for Block II. Moving the GBSAA display into the UGCS provides the aircraft operator real-time information for evasive maneuvers.  Funding supports additional features to minimize operator workload and combines two operator screens onto one display to decrease logistic footprint. Block II decreases operational and sustainment costs, operator workload, hardware\/software costs, increases system safety, and provides full materiel release for soldier operation."

A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.\n\nThe RDTE funded elements for GPS Denied, UGCS Improvements and Alternate Munition Integration addressed in this submission are planned for award on the\nGray Eagle Engineering Services contract as a Sub-Engineering Services Memorandum (SESM) task order, and as Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requisitions (MIPRs) to various other Government Agencies. The purpose of the SESMs is to mature the respective designs to a level that Engineering Change Requests (ECR) are submitted to the Government via the Configuration Control Board (CCB). Following successful completion of the SESM and CCB approval, a contract modification to retrofit and\/or cut-in the respective engineering change will be awarded on the appropriate Performance Based Logistics (PBL) or Production contract.  The RDTE funded element for GBSAA Block II addressed in this submission are planned for award on various contracts and MIPR actions to other government agencies."

It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities. Digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, are used to provide an operational picture for leaders. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts; between joint and multi-national forces, combat material, and training efforts. 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software from a System of Systems (SOS) perspective. 3) Develop Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) programs into a single integrated system. \n\nDigitization efforts are in support of the Army Equipping Strategy, National Defense Authorization Act 804, and OSD reports to Congress."

Continued development of the suite of the AE2S applications is necessary to create and improve workflow efficiencies amongst various organizations and data base systems, Active and Reserve Component equipment transparency reporting requirements, and Active and Reserve equipment fielding plans to the Solider according to the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). Additionally, this program element funds various Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) projects that provide system engineering expertise to provide unbiased advice, formulate course of actions, analyze programs and make technical support and process recommendations to create efficiencies and improve systems.  Specifically, these FFRDC projects support Army Mission Command and network architecture (operational and systems) development, technical and policy document review in support of planning and acquisition, network and joint integration and interoperability evaluations and assessments, program and database analysis, independent technical analysis, special studies, and acquisition process improvement.  In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 804 and support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s (OSD) report to Congress, the Army is poised to implement an incremental approach to software development and hardware\/software capability integration. This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army"

The Avenger\u2019s mission is to protect fixed critical assets and Corps\/Echelons above Corps Maneuver forces from Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), and Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing aircraft.  Avenger provides day\/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability. Avenger can be air dropped, lifted by helicopter and is air transportable.  The system employs up to eight Stinger missiles to counter aerial threats and a M3P gun for close-in ground and air threats.  The gunner can visually track targets through use of a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR) that can detect and track targets during the day and at night.  An on-board laser range finder provides range.  An IFF system aids in the identification of friendly aircraft in order to minimize the potential for fratricide.  The Avenger fleet has 170 systems that are equipped with a digital Slew-to-Cue (STC) capability to speed target detection and engagement.  Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command Control and Intelligence System (C2I) passes radar target information to the Avenger for display.  The operator can then select a target for engagement from the display, which will automatically slew the turret and place the target in the gunner\u2019s FLIR field of view.\n\nFY2018 Base dollars in the amount of $2.723 million provides funding to ensure the Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of its program life. The Avenger Modification \u2013 Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) keeps Avenger sustainable and relevant until replaced by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2- Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 31 timeframe. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), vehicle internal communication (VIC) system and the IFF will undergo upgrades to meet Information Assurance (IA) and operational requirements."

Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low- altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM). Stinger is deployable from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS. The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.\n\nThe addition of a PROX to the current Block I configuration will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3\/5\/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.\n\nA SHORAD \u201cshoot off\u201d in 4QFY17 will evaluate industry solutions for mitigating the maneuver SHORAD capability gap. The intent is to determine which industry products that the Army could rapidly field to maneuver units between FY19-25.\n\nFY2018 OCO dollars in the amount of $8.450 million support the continuation of design, development, test, and integration of a proximity fuse into the existing Stinger Block I missile."

FY18 Base funds in the amount of $5.000 million supports operational testing, corrections of identified deficiencies, and fielding support activities for a Height-of-Burst capability via proximity sensor. \n\nDZ9: ATACMS Mods effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory. Block (BLK) I\/IA ATACMS currently have warheads that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a BLK I\/IA missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant warhead, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. Performance of a characterization effort will include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration. There is no FY18 funding.\n\nVT9: Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) develops, integrates, and tests the Switchblade Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL).  Multi-Pack Launcher provides the capability to launch up to 6 Switchblade missiles remotely in a Force Protection Environment. The mission for the MPL is to be placed in a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in a constant ready-to-use state to enable Soldiers to remain in the safety of a building while launching Switchblade missiles.  There is no FY18 funding. \n\n045:  Hellfire Prod Imp Prog integrates the Longbow 7A missile, which provides increased seeker capability to acquire and attack a wider variety of targets, and integrates a blast fragmentation sleeve and proximity fuse to increase lethality onto the MQ-1 Gray Eagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  In addition, this program supports the integration with missile technical and software support from both the Federal government and the Longbow prime contractor and the upgrade of a limited number of Longbow missiles for integration testing.  There is no FY18 funding."

This effort will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory. Block (BLK) I\/IA ATACMS currently have warheads that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a BLK I\/IA missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant warhead, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. Performance of a characterization effort will include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration.\n\nThere is no FY18 funding."

GBOSS-E will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.\n\nIGSSR-C:  The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE). This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.\n\nIntegrated Base Defense (IBD): The purpose of IBD Kitting is to harvest and refurbish physical security and Force Protection (FP) Non-Standard Equipment (NS-E) and package them into integrated and interoperable IBD Capabilities.  IBD provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base and Installation Protection (IUBIP) framework.  In support of JUONS 0540 to address the Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) threat.  Additional capabilities are being developed and integrated to the current Force Protection structure."

GBOSS-E will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Medium variant (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy variant (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps. GBOSS-E will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.\n\nIGSSR-C:  The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE). This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.\n\nIntegrated Base Defense (IBD): The purpose of IBD Kitting is to harvest and refurbish physical security and FP Non-Standard Equipment and package them into integrated and interoperable IBD Capabilities.  IBD provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base and Installation Protection framework.\n\nNo FY 2018 funding request."

The G-BOSS(E) Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved May 2014. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. G-BOSS(E) received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015. Pending successful Milestone B decision in FY 2017, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's G-BOSS(E) program requirements. The acquisition strategy for G-BOSS(E) was signed by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 11 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements. Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align G-BOSS(E), IGSSR-C, and Tactical Security System (TSS) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. \n\nThe Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. IGSSR-C received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was signed by the MDA on 5 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to develop, integrate and test the Initial Capability (IC).  No production activities are planned for FY 2017. Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)), Tactical Security System (TSS) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. \n\nThe IBD acquisition strategy is to leverage existing IBD-related government organizations and to competitively award multiple contracts in support of IBD objectives for the development of holistic IBD architectures and products to support interoperability of fielded and emerging IBD-related systems.\n\nFY17 funding supports IBD Kitting and JUONS 0540. Product Manager Force Protection Systems is overseeing the integration of both Commercial Off The Shelf and Government developed technologies that will address the identified capability gap to the existing Force Protection structure."

GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24\/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.\n\nThe GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) which has been developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production. GMLRS AW entered full rate production in FY 2015. The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.\n\nThe first increment was GMLRS DPICM. The second increment is GMLRS Unitary. The third increment is GMLRS AW. The fourth increment evolved into the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) program under a separate program element. \n\nThe GMLRS program will continue to leverage ongoing Science & Technology (S&T) efforts to extend range and increase survivability. The GMLRS extended range effort will be approximately 85% common with Increments 2 and 3.  It will extend the current GMLRS capability to 150 km and allow for potential future growth capability in the payload section.\n\nThe FY2018 dollars in the amount of $102.807 million will complete the testing and qualification of the Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS); continue qualification of key rocket obsolescence upgrades (including the M-Code compliant NAVSTRIKE-M upgrade); evaluate rocket pod improvements; and initiate the design, qualification and testing of an extended range variant of the GMLRS."

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)\/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.\n\nInformation Assurance Development funding Implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) capabilities In Coordination With (ICW) the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future material solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of CS capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the Department of Defense (DoD) and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data IAW the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS , System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) for Army Capability Sets for CS\/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks. \n\nThe Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems. \n\nThe Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).  The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client (MGC) Nodes began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.  AKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI). \n \nThe AKMI is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI) and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the AKMS.  AKMI automates the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMI Program includes the MGC nodes, ACES and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small, Medium and Large.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern ECU\u2019s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support CMI. \n\nThe Crypto Modernization program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Network.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging CS\/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.\n\nEmbedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure enduring Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms and keys.  Tactical radios using embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to modernize their cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms.  If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk."

The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)\/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camps and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization Strategy Plan. \n\nImplement, establish functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) capabilities In Coordination With (ICW) the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future materiel solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. \n\nDevelop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of IA capabilities that will bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing secure information exchange of voice, video, and data IAW the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) Army Capability Sets for CS\/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for the tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camps, and station networks. \n\nThe Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and provides situational awareness of the cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with a common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems."

                                        "val": "The Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).\n\nThe NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client  (MGC) nodes began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.\n\nAKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI).  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  Two critical components required for the transition include the development of the Mission Planning Management Support System (MPMSS) and the ability to support Over the Network Keying (OTNK).\n\nMP\/MSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling secure transparent provisioning of KMI products.  MP\/MSS service is being developed by NSA but each Service is responsible for interface development and final integration into their infrastructure.  ACES is the initial target for the interface to MPMSS.  NSA will be providing additional capabilities and updates to the MP\/MSS interface specification through technology insertions in the out years.  The Army must then adjust to these changes delivered by NSA.   \n\nOne of the major enhancement in the KMI architecture is the ability to leverage OTNK.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to from the tactical edge up through strategic ECU's.  Within AKMS this capability will be focused on ACES and SKL platform.  ACES and SKL will act as an interim solution for all legacy ECUs to be recognized on the KMI network until they can be upgraded to be fully KMI aware.  OTNK developments began in FY2015.\n\nTo support this transition, a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine must be developed for the SKL platform.  The KOV-21 card used in current Army Tier 3 fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support the new capabilities being delivered by KMI.  Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV-21 card as a technology insertion.  AKMS RDT&E funding line 501 realigned to DV4 \/ KMI FY17 and out."

It is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA)'s Electronic Key Management System (EKMS).  The AKMS allows the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5M End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. \n\nAKMS was initially approved for Milestone III in FY99.  The AKMS System of Systems originally included Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Data Transfer Device (DTD) (AN-CYZ-10).  In 2QFY02, the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority approved the procurement of the Simple Key Loader (SKL) as the replacement for the DTD within the AKMS System of Systems (SoS) POR.  AKMS is a fully fielded POR that undergoes modifications to meet emerging operational needs.\n\nThe NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI.  The Army's implementation of the NSA KMI is the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) program.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  \n\nThe LCMS component of the AKMS SoS (AN\/GYK-49) is fully fielded.  The LCMS is assigned to the COMSEC Account Manager\/COMSEC Custodian.   LCMS most recent hardware refresh was completed in FY12.  The current software baseline is 5.1.0.5 with certain select accounts upgrading to v5.2 based on operational needs.  Further LCMS software releases are not anticipated.  LCMS workstations will be replaced by KMI Management Client (MGC) Nodes before the NSA mandated EKMS Tier 2 sunset of December 2017.  EKMS Common Tier 1 operations and Tier 1 operational support continues to be provided by CECOM.  LCMS hardware is sustained by CSLA until fully replaced by the KMI MGC.\n\nThe ACES component of the AKMS SoS (AN\/GYK-33) current hardware platform is a Dell E6500 non-ruggedized laptop fielded to S6, Spectrum Managers and some COMSEC Account Managers at Battalion level and above.  ACES is undergoing a hardware technology refresh and will be replacing 1\/5 quantity of laptops each year.  The current version of ACES is 3.4.  Software is released on an annual basis and coincides with the Capability Set delivery schedule.  PL Net E currently holds the software development contract.  As the Tier 2.5 component, ACES operates between the LCMS (Tier 2) and the SKL (Tier 3).  It links the key data from the LCMS with mission planning data for a single load by the SKL into the ECUs.  ACES will continue with modifications to support the AKMI System of Systems.  In order to support AKMI, ACES must be modified to seamlessly operate within the KMI architecture.\n\nThe SKL is the primary Army fill device and is the Tier 3 component of the AKMS SoS (AN\/PYQ-10).  The SKL is fully fielded to the Army.  Army holds the sole full rate production procurement contract for the SKL, which is heavily utilized by other DoD and civil services as well as FMS customers.  The SKL repair capability is with the Original Equipment Manufacturer but TYAD is developing an organic depot repair support.  The SKL and its cryptographic engine are facing hardware obsolescence issues. SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine resolves these issues and lays the foundation for the Army's Next Generation Load Device - Medium capability.  The SKL v3.1 modifications will be made to the Army's existing fleet of the fill devices via a modification kit starting in FY15.  The KMI cryptographic engine is reliant on the CERDEC led RESCUE RDT&E effort that began in FY14.\n\nAKMS RDT&E funding line 501 realigned to DV4 \/ KMI FY17 and out."

AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI) and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  \n\nThe AKMI Program includes the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small, Medium and Large.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern End Crypto Units (ECU)s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support CMI. \n\nOne of the major enhancement in the AKMI architecture is the ability for to leverage the various capabilities and services from NSA KMI.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to from the tactical edge up through strategic ECU\u2019s.  The objective AKMI capabilities will be found in all of the products across the AKMI product line to include MGC, ACES and NGLD family of fill devices.  NGLD family will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until legacy ECUs are fully modernized.  \n   \nThe NGLD Medium and Large are reliant on the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE), a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine that is currently being developed. The KOV-21 card currently used in Army Simple Key Loader (SKL) fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK. Redesign and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated under the RESCUE program. The current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion. The NGLD-Large technology development will start in FY2019.  The NGLD-Large development will provide the same capabilities as the NGLD-Medium, along with wireless (802.11) and additional memory (64 GB) requirements."

AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record.  The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5M End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. \n\nAKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12.  The AKMI Program will include the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family. Each component of the AKMI Program is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.  \n\nThe NSA KMI Program is replacing the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017.  Components of the AKMI Program will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.  \n\nThe NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army fill devices and Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program. The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13. The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium, and large) to meet the AKMI requirements. The AKMI program has partnered with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE). The Army will gain the NGLD Medium capability through the SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the RESCUE, the first iteration of the RESCUE being\nthe KOV-21 Replacement. The redesign of the current SKL cryptographic engine, the KOV-21 card, is required due to parts obsolescence and inability to be KMI Aware. The KOV-21 Replacement is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion into the SKL v3.1 which in turn meets the NGLD Medium CPD requirements. The NGLD Medium will be available in FY19. Additionally, the Army NGLD large strategy is highly reliant on the development of the RESCUE and will drive a materiel solution decision in FY19."

The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection."

The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army LandWarNet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies.

Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future."

MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.\n\nFY 17 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the follow-on Wideband AoA, and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.\n\nFY18 and out funding will be realigned to 0103142A.FE2 to reflect the new Major Force Program 12 (MFP12) Space configuration."

T2C2 will provide a high bandwidth tactical network extension for small unit CPs operating beyond line-of-sight from their higher headquarters and for teams operating outside the full tactical network architecture. The acquisition strategy leverages an existing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract supporting the commercialization of the preceding SBIR efforts. T2C2 will utilize a two-level maintenance concept, will be Soldier-maintained, and initially supported by Interim Contractor Support. An analysis will be conducted to determine the ultimate supportability path. This strategy will allow a capability to be integrated and delivered quickly to support a limited deployment of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units in FY17 required for Production Verification and the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), with Full-Rate Production (FRP) planned for 4Q FY17."

GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of National Security. The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A was re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)\/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and Mission Command Workstation. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.\n \nArmy Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management.\n\nFiscal Year 2018 Base funding in the amount of $0.316 million supports GCCS-A 4.3 software updates and Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing of the GCCS-A Bridge Effort in conjunction with Common Operating Environment. Certification testing ensures that GCCS-A Bridge Effort software is successfully configured as a virtual machine on BCCS\/TSI and is interoperable with Army and Joint Mission Command Systems.\n\nFiscal Year 2018 base funding in the amount of $5.712 million will support the Army\u2019s capability for unit readiness reporting, unit registration and force planning and projection activities to enable Title 10 reporting to Congress.  Specifically the funding will provide program and acquisition oversight, technical development and training support to enable the readiness and force projection capabilities."

GCCS-A dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action, develop and manage Army forces and execute war plans. GCCS-A links the GCCS-Joint Common Operating Picture with the Army Mission Command systems. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)\/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and Mission Command Workstation.  \n\nFiscal Year 2018 Base funding in the amount of $0.316 million supports GCCS-A 4.3 software updates and Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing of the GCCS-A Bridge Effort in conjunction with Common Operating Environment. Certification testing ensures that GCCS-A Bridge Effort software is successfully configured as a virtual machine on BCCS\/TSI and is interoperable with Army and Joint Mission Command Systems.\n\nFiscal Year 2018 base funding in the amount of $5.712 million will support the Army\u2019s capability for unit readiness reporting, unit registration and force planning and projection activities to enable Title 10 reporting to Congress.

AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 is a software only implementation of strategic applications and interoperability services that leverage the unified software architecture design (core infrastructure and selected common applications being implemented in the CPCE) that provides Army leaders:  Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management. Capability Packages enabled by AJaSC2 are providing Force Employment, Joint Force Synchronization, and Total Force Analysis.  The operational payoff providing the Joint Force Commander a linkage between Army Mission Command and Unified Action Partners, enabling Unified Action through integration with existing and future applications (including CPCE and MCE) and contributes to achieving Shared Understanding during Unified Land Operations (ULO) facilitating effective Mission Command. \n\nCurrent plan for Fiscal Year 2017 funding is to utilize 853K to support initial development design of Capability Packages. Fiscal Year 2018 base funding supports program level pre-Material Development Decision (MDD) activities including final design efforts, documentation required by policy and regulation, research and analysis, and Joint requirements validation process."

The AMCUA CDP provides an overarching structure for future Army Mission Command systems. The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the \"Information Technology (IT) Box\" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts."

                        "val": "Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. \n\nSmall Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  \n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical \/ Infra Red \/ Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day\/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO\/IR\/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   \n\nProject 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  \n\nProject 123:   The UAS Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC\/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. Full Rate Production (FRP) was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform.  Based on Initial Operational test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results, STARLite is increasing its software capabilities to increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) and aligns SPE with the COE requirements. The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software  improvements.  Integration onto the Gray Eagle will be done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.\n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) EO\/IR\/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. Full Rate Production (FRP) was completed June 2013. A three (3) year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform RDT&E activities. The Enhanced EO\/IR Capability Production Document, projected for approval in 1QFY17, defines additional KPP requirements for Full Motion Video (FMV) sensors.  The first KPP increases detection, recognition, and identification requirements which can only be met with the High Definition (HD) variation of the CSP.  Currently, select units have been fielded HD CSPs, with additional HD CSPs in production and retrofit.  The second KPP requirement is for the CSP to be a metric sensor with rapid and enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA).  The acquisition strategy for CSP in FY 2018 is to mature Software and Hardware efforts for CSP to reduce cognitive burdens on the Warfighter and begin to develop the CSP as a metric sensor providing rapid and enhanced TLA and through a sole source cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to Raytheon.   \n\nThe acquisition strategy is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle; begin development of the CSP as a metric sensor enabling rapid and enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA); and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support to the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to continue enhancing CSP's usability for the Warfighter to reduce cognitive burden by providing improved situational awareness, while providing multiple fields of view in a simplified manner through Hardware (H\/W) and S\/W improvements."

The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigured to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2018 Base funding in the amount of $1.480 million will be used to complete engineering corrective actions and regression testing from DT\/LUT testing and preparations for TSP Block 2."

The TSP program completed the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition with a period of performance that was completed in October 2015, and focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform, and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program. \n\nThe TSP program entered the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase with a Milestone C decision that was approved on 2 May 2014. The TSP Program LRIP contract award was based on sole source selection with a period of performance that was completed on June 2016, and primarily focused on the obsolescence of the EMD phase assets via the required Engineering Change Proposals, and the first initial production of 30 TSP Payloads in support of the Gray Eagle Platform.\n\nThe TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record capability. TSP Beyond Block 1 will address objectives and remaining deferred Block 1 threshold requirements as reflected in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD). \n\nImproved Gray Eagle (IGE)- Program Manager Unmanned Aircraft Systems(PM UAS)received a Congressional plus up of $49M President's Budget15(PB15) to procure Extended Range UAS which increases the CPD objective endurance requirements for the current GE configuration to an Improved Gray Eagle (IGE). TSP is scheduled for integration and testing on the IGE platform upon completion of the platform's Follow on Test Evaluation#2 scheduled 1QFY18."

EMARSS will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT). \n\nThis funding line supports non-recurring engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC), testing, integration and Modifications in Service of Army Aerial, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) systems.  Funding provides for Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues involved with the conversion of Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA) to the EMARSS Program of Record (POR), in regards to the Navy AAR-47 converting to Army AAR-57, Blue Force Tracker (BFT) to Blue Force Tracker-2 (BFT-2) and Common Missile Warning Systems (CMWS) upgrades."

ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8).\n\nThis funding line supports non-recurring engineering (NRE), development of supplemental type certificates (STC), testing, and integration.  Funding provides for Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues involved with the conversion of Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to the ARL-E Program of Record (POR)."

The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE). DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. As new software capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of modifications will be integrated and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.\n\nDCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) for FY19 fielding.\n\nDCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission. DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment. The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle. This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.\n\nThe DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based data center processing environments. The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment\/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored. This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems. Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12\/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, Follow-on Test & Evaluation in 3QFY15, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Baseline throughout the Army.\n\nFY2018 has no funding for Project 956.\n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $24.700 million for D07, DCGS-A, will continue the iterative software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires. DCGS-A will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi- intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), while providing the incremental software updates required to remain current."

This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from Humanitarian and Disaster Relief (HADR) to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.\n\nThe DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based data center processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment\/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12\/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, Follow-on Test & Evaluation in 3Q FY15, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Baseline throughout the Army.\n\nFY2018 has no funding for Project 956."

That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCG\/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. \n\nDCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance\/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. \n\nPM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software and hardware integration for Increment 1, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts."

The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced commercial capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be provided into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.\n\nDCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.   This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) for FY19 fielding.  \n\nDCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  \n\nFY2018 Base funding in the amount of $24.7 million will be utilized to identify the Army specifications and prepare to procure a data management architecture to meet the Army\u2019s requirements for the Brigade Combat Team echelon and above to replace the DCGS-A Brain. The architecture will consist of a ingest framework, persistence store, egress data service, fusion engine, and a visualization framework. This will continue to deliver critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the use of modern commercial item technologies and advanced analytic capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through the alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) and Joint Information Environment (JIE)."

The DCGS-A program will consist of multiple software releases structured to meet DCGS-A User requirements.  The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment\/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army\u2019s operational needs.\n\nThe DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.\n\nDCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon\u2019s intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A will deliver these capabilities by fielding software releases with incremental increases in capabilities with each release. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.\n\nThe DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. The time phasing of planned content of each release will be based upon an assessment of available and projected technological solution sets. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies."

Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.\n\nA SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch\/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  SUAS is transitioning to a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that will utilize existing RQ-11 and RQ-20 in a system of systems fielding concept, with a Short Range Micro (SRM) option under consideration.\n\nJustification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $2.191 million will be utilized for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to continue the research and development required to identify and baseline the SRM prototype solution for the Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems effort. Options range from testing non developmental items produced by industry to researching what other government agencies have achieved in quad copter development and technology."

The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products.\n\nA SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch\/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  SUAS is transitioning to a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that will utilize existing RQ-11 and RQ-20 in a system of systems fielding concept, with a Short Range Micro (SRM) option under consideration.\n\nJustification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $2.191 million will be utilized for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to continue the research and development required to identify and baseline the Short Range Micro (SRM) prototype solution for the Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems effort.  Options range from testing non developmental items produced by industry to researching what other government agencies have achieved in quad copter development and technology."

In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the Combat Aviation Brigade's (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalion.  This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities.  The RQ-7B Shadow has logged over 1,050,000 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).\n\nThe full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle.  Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF).  The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO\/IR), but half of those have been replaced with a Laser Designator (LD) payload.  All 104 systems required by the Army Procurement Objective (APO) have been procured.  In 2010 the Army G8 established an RQ-7B Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) MODs program.   \n\nJustification:  Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 RQ-7B UAS Base funding of $12.773 million will be utilized in the following:  1) $10.654M will be used to continue modifications for the RQ-7B UAS, 2) $2.119M provides interoperability and enhancements for the One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT). The $10.645M for modifications of the RQ-7B UAS will continue development of the air vehicle modifications to allow operations in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment.  This is a phased, multi-year effort. Phase I (FY16) provided a trade study to determine the best hardware and software alternatives.  Phase II (FY16) initiated the design and development through preliminary design review. Phase III (FY17) will complete design and development through critical design review and conduct engineering flight testing. Phase IV (FY18) will complete development, qualification, and developmental testing.  RDTE also provides interoperability modifications that support Manned Unmanned Teaming with the AH-64 Apache Helicopter, and Test and Evaluation to support the capability improvements."

In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the Combat Aviation Brigade's (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalion.  This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities.  The RQ-7B Shadow has logged over 1,050,000 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).\n\nThe full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle.  Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF).  The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO\/IR), but half of those have been replaced with a Laser Designator (LD) payload.  All 104 systems required by the Army Procurement Objective (APO) have been procured.  In 2010 the Army G8 established an RQ-7B Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) MODs program.   \n\nJustification:  Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 RQ-7B UAS Base funding of $12.773 million will be utilized in the following:  1) $10.654M will be used to continue modifications for the RQ-7B UAS, 2) $2.119M provides interoperability and enhancements for the One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT). The $10.645M for modifications of the RQ-7B UAS will continue development of the air vehicle modifications to allow operations in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment.  This is a phased, multi-year effort. Phase I (FY16) provided a trade study to determine the best hardware and software alternatives.  Phase II (FY16) initiated the design and development through preliminary design review. Phase III (FY17) will complete design and development through critical design review and conduct engineering flight testing. Phase IV (FY18) will complete development, qualification, and developmental testing.  RDTE also provides interoperability modifications that support Manned Unmanned Teaming with the AH-64 Apache Helicopter, and Test and Evaluation to support the capability improvements."

The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 2002 and in FY2009 the last of the authorized 104 systems was placed on contract.  Continued development of the selected Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2,  Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades.  Development\/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on an engineering services contract with Shadow contractors.  Development of the Block III engine is being accomplished through a competitive process."

These two devices support the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  The BAT-A system is the Army\u2019s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store, and share biometric and contextual information on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  All research and development efforts are now concluded for BAT-A.  PL BAT-A will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a Post Milestone C program of record in sustainment.\n\nThe FY18 Base Funding of $2.537 million supports the program efforts to begin the transition phase from the current BAT-A POR configuration to the updated Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC) to replace BAT-A.  The NXGBCC will be a part of the DoD Biometric Enterprise to protect and support the warfighter and nation through global identity superiority. The NXGBCC shall collect, match, store, share, analyze, reference, and manage contextual data and biometrics.  This includes iris, fingerprint, facial images, palm prints and voice on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals to inform the warfighter in a decide\/act response.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners. \n\nThe FY18 OCO funding provides continued support for Five Vigilant Pursuit System Sets (10 vehicles total plus equipment) are currently deployed in support of OFS and OIR.  The Vigilant Pursuit System currently consists of 2 vehicles with integrated Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages installed on MATVs. \n\nFY18 OCO Funding of $3.886 million supports developmental activities to create modularized, vehicle-independent and tailorable Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages that can be installed and removed in a matter of minutes on any vehicle type to meet specific mission needs. Specific activities include hardware development for critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace\/upgrade open source code that is no longer current\/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  \n\t\nLastly for FY18, the OCO Funding of $2.150 million supports the development of new software code & associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.  The new, more capable software will facilitate automated information exchange with complimentary community programs resident on the IC ITE C2S cloud to support the production of a Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) containing all available IC Biometrics and Identity Intelligence.  The Army will execute this funding in FY18 and deliver capabilities within 12 months."

United States Central Command (CENTCOM) submitted JUONS CC-0548 on 11 Dec 15 for enhanced biometric capabilities to support current operations.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated 5 key requirements of JUONS CC-0548 on 3 June 2016 and identified the requirements as \"key enablers\" to existing JEON CCE-0008 (near Real-Time Identity Operations).  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) assigned execution responsibility for the validated 5 key requirements in JUONS CC-0548 to the Army on 30 June 2016.

These two devices support the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  The BAT-A system is the Army\u2019s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store, and share biometric and contextual information on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  All research and development efforts are now concluded for BAT-A.  PL BAT-A will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a Post Milestone C program of record in sustainment.\n\nThe FY18 Base funding of $2.537 million supports the program efforts to begin the transition phase from the current BAT-A POR configuration to the updated Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC) to replace BAT-A.  The NXGBCC will be a part of the DoD Biometric Enterprise to protect and support the warfighter and nation through global identity superiority. The NXGBCC shall collect, match, store, share, analyze, reference, and manage contextual data and biometrics.  This includes iris, fingerprint, facial images, palm prints and voice on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals to inform the warfighter in a decide\/act response.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners. \n\nThe FY18 OCO funding provides continued support for Five Vigilant Pursuit System Sets (10 vehicles total plus equipment) are currently deployed in support of OFS and OIR.  The Vigilant Pursuit System currently consists of 2 vehicles with integrated Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages installed on MATVs. \n\nFY18 OCO funding of $3.886 million supports developmental activities to create modularized, vehicle-independent and tailorable Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages that can be installed and removed in a matter of minutes on any vehicle type to meet specific mission needs. Specific activities include hardware development for critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace\/upgrade open source code that is no longer current\/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  \n\t\nLastly for FY18, the OCO funding of $2.150 million supports the development of new software code & associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.  The new, more capable software will facilitate automated information exchange with complimentary community programs resident on the IC ITE C2S cloud to support the production of a Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) containing all available IC Biometrics and Identity Intelligence.  The Army will execute this funding in FY18 and deliver capabilities within 12 months."

The objective of this task is to obtain the data, analysis, and trade-off methodology for the Materiel Developer to use in order to meet the NXGBCC requirement via a commercial-off-the-shelf biometric collection and communication capability that is cost effective and fielded in time to replace the BAT-A system.  The primary activity that will be used to gather the data, analyze the data, and determine a trade-off methodology will be a technical study of commercially available biometrics collection and communications capabilities, using a functional and technical decomposition of the NXGBCC Capabilities Production Document (CPD) as the criteria set.  The PMO will work with the TRADOC Capability Manager to analyze the NXGBCC Capability Production Document (CPD) and determine the appropriate level of functional and technical requirements decomposition.  The current acquisition strategy is to award the Technical Services contract during 2QFY18. \n\nFY17 RDT&E OCO acquisition strategy reflected from the supplemental request is for the current contractor to further develop and refine three portable DNA prototype solutions for JUONS CC-0548.  The contractor will be tasked to reduce the size and weight of the DNA prototype devices.  Also, funds will enable the contractor begin initial operational fielding and test simulation for an operational or military utility assessment. The planned delivery date of the prototypes is during 2QFY18.\n\nThe FY18 RDT&E OCO acquisition strategy will continue to solicit a contractor to continue to develop activities for the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved Vigilant Pursuit Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to modularize the Multi-INT collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination hardware and software to enhance usability from the Soldier perspective.  A contractor will also be selected to finish developing and testing the I2AR capability to install and configure the capability on the IC ITE Cloud on the JWICS and SIPRNet domains."

The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven Government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated network management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams to Company-level through FY2018. Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining situational awareness and mission command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30-Megabit per second aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that transmission paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or lose connectivity. This capability offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks. WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep mobile and dispersed forces networked through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts \u201cColorless Core\u201d technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the \u201ccore\u201d of the network. The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.\n\nInc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.\n\nFY18 funds support development efforts for Technical Insertions, support Operational Testing (Joint Warfighting Assessment 18), and support Next Generation Point of Presence (PoP) and Soldier Network Extension (SNE) efforts."

The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven Government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated network management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams to Company-level through FY2018. Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining situational awareness and mission command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30-Megabit per second aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that transmission paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or lose connectivity. This capability offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks. WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep mobile and dispersed forces networked through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts \u201cColorless Core\u201d technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the \u201ccore\u201d of the network. The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.\n\nInc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.\n\nFY18 funds support development efforts for Technical Insertions, support Operational Testing (JWA 18), and support Next Gen PoP and SNE efforts."

DEWSS is composed of the\nSuper High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support\nlegacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS\nand WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end\nconnectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations\n\nFE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE):\nMilitary Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.\n\nFE4 \/ Enroute Mission Command:  \nMission Description and Budget Item Justification:\nEnroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations\nwith the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC\nprovides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth\nsupport required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information\nregarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective. The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the\nlatest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.\n\nDue to rephasing of FY17 OPA funding into FY18\/19, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku FISA FOC (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.\n\nFY18 funding supports the Ka solution requirement of Wideband Global System (WGS) Terminal and Modem Certification.  The certification process will ensure that terminals conform to the minimum performance and operational control requirements as defined in the WGS Ka-Band Terminal Certification Requirements Document."

Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future."

MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.\n\nFY17 and prior funding was aligned to 0303142A\/456. \n\nFY18 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM communications Systems (PSCS). In addition, FY18 funding covers the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo Modem Testing, Narrowband (MUOS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the follow-on Wideband AoA, Protected Tactical Service Field Demo, NCW Tool Development and Testing and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations."

JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems\/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. \n\nJTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. JTAGS funding was moved to a new PE as directed by OSD to track Space Programs.\n\nThe JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 will be completed in FY17. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. P3I Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers stereo SBIRS Geosynchronous scanner capability and Pseudo-Link 4 (P\/L 4) data. Spiral 2 delivers Cobra Brass and \"Walkers\" data (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible."

JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems\/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. \n\nJTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. JTAGS funding was moved to a new PE as directed by OSD to track Space Programs.\n\nThe JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 will be completed in FY17. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. P3I Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers stereo SBIRS Geosynchronous scanner capability and Pseudo-Link 4 (P\/L 4) data. Spiral 2 delivers Cobra Brass and \"Walkers\" data (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible."

P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, improving warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS  Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort.  JTAGS Block II Phase 2 is further divided into three spirals to provide critical capabilities to the fielded units faster.  JTAGS Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers stereo SBIRS Geosynchronous scanner capability and Pseudo-Link 4 (P\/L 4) data. Spiral 2 delivers Cobra Brass and \"Walkers\" data (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JTAGS Block II Phase 2 is a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) option on the JTAGS Block II (P3I) contract (W9113M-12-C-0055).  The option will be exercised based on a contractor updated proposal and Government technical evaluation.

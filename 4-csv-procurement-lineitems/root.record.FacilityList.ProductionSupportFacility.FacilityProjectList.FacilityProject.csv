At WSMR, provides badly needed upgrades to aged nuclear effects simulators used to test weapon system survivability and provides upgrades to the Semiconductor Test Laboratory used to characterize electronic piece-parts (complex integrated circuits such as microprocessors) to determine their vulnerability to and survivability in nuclear weapons and space radiation environments.  At YPG, purchases on-board data acquisition and recording equipment for collecting vehicle performance data in harsh desert environments; purchases pyroshock accelerometers, blast over pressure gages, infrared flash detectors and triggers and various types of displacement transducers used to assess weapons ballistic performance; procures replacement power amplifiers in the vibration test facility supporting shock and vibration tests and also upgrades instrumentation and test fixtures in the vibration test facility used to simulate field shock and vibration environments; procures high speed digital cameras for capturing test events and procures low cost, rapidly deployable earth filled walls/structures to protect personnel and equipment during weapon firing test activities. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.

At WSMR, provides badly needed upgrades to aged nuclear effects simulators used to test weapon system survivability and provides upgrades to the Semiconductor Test Laboratory used to characterize electronic piece-parts (complex integrated circuits such as microprocessors) to determine their vulnerability to and survivability in nuclear weapons and space radiation environments.  At YPG, purchases on-board data acquisition and recording equipment for collecting vehicle performance data in harsh desert environments; purchases pyroshock accelerometers, blast over pressure gages, infrared flash detectors and triggers and various types of displacement transducers used to assess weapons ballistic performance; procures replacement power amplifiers in the vibration test facility supporting shock and vibration tests and also upgrades instrumentation and test fixtures in the vibration test facility used to simulate field shock and vibration environments; procures high speed digital cameras for capturing test events and procures low cost, rapidly deployable earth filled walls/structures to protect personnel and equipment during weapon firing test activities. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.

FY 2020 Procurement dollars focus on a variety of projects to include preliminary design of thermal and non-thermal alternatives to open burning/open detonation efforts to achieve compliance with Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board Policy and Tank Line Modernization efforts to replace existing tank line that was constructed in the 1940's at the Iowa AAP;   Modernization of Water Distribution (supporting process water, drinking water and fire suppression water) and design of a new Alternative Nitrate Ester Manufacturing Facility to support annual nitroglycerin production requirements at the Radford AAP;  Small Caliber ammunition modernization efforts will also continue in support the Next Generation Squad Weapon at the Lake City AAP.","2020-BASE_PROCUREMENT-2020-ARMY_AMMO-U_PROCUREMENT_JustificationBook_Army_PB_2020.zzz_unzipped-U_PROCUREMENT_JustificationBook_Army_PB_2020.xml","3ff5717c0071fdda534afc6a225eb17d1ca462eab0f167c6886a39c906a1ea0f","0-e0394a1f1ccff7fddad2411e65d6a8ab65a1ad178c505defd89e6eb3ad1c62d1","7-dc4330a0fe33d8caf41632cdcbf2db161e12911cbc175ffef389769f4694c169","root.record.FacilityList.ProductionSupportFacility"

Supports the procurement of ammunition/weapons components including gun mounts, gun tubes, breech assemblies, and other main weapon system components. These components are required to support proof and acceptance testing at ATC and Yuma Test Center YTC. Without these components, the Army will be unable to conduct the testing required to accept ammunition end items into its inventory and to mitigate operational risk due to ammunition shortfalls across the Army.  At ATC, continues replacement and procurement for Weapon and Weapon Components which have experienced wear and tear during repetitive testing of production ammunition items. Typical purchases include: rifle/carbine/machine gun barrels, receivers, and parts; large caliber barrels; small and medium caliber Mann-type test barrels, mortar barrels and bipod/baseplates.  Timely replacement of worn or unserviceable weapons/components will permit test execution without delays for acquisition of supporting equipment.  At YTC, procures Ammo Components to continue support Production Acceptance Test (PAT) of artillery and mortar ammunition components at YTC throughout the year.  Also procures replacement parts for large and small caliber direct fire weapon systems for production based support, which will improve weapon reliability and reduce potential testing downtime if sudden repairs are needed.  This project increases test efficiencies and decreases costs and risks to Army Program Managers.","2020-BASE_PROCUREMENT-2020-ARMY_AMMO-U_PROCUREMENT_JustificationBook_Army_PB_2020.zzz_unzipped-U_PROCUREMENT_JustificationBook_Army_PB_2020.xml","3ff5717c0071fdda534afc6a225eb17d1ca462eab0f167c6886a39c906a1ea0f","0-ebdee1ef4f02c1857aae4cd3c55489541cc78ef115645203ab423c7ace1bbd6c","8-33c0f4589bf3b43348a065e05600df474ebc0ef2a80aa1e9a74bba0a426e3a6f","root.record.FacilityList.ProductionSupportFacility"

These projects include but are not limited to the NATO Mid-Term (NMT) project, the Large Aircraft Infrared Counter-Measures (LAIRCM) project, the Follow-on Upgrade I (FUP I) project, and future modernization projects.  The NMT project upgrades the mission computers, provides improved man-machine interfaces, Multi-Sensor Integration (MSI), digital communications, satellite communications, and adds 5 new consoles to the aircraft.  These Mid-Term projects will update the NATO E-3 aircraft with capabilities to maintain fleet operational effectiveness and interoperability well into the 21st century.  The LAIRCM project installs a self-defense capability into the NATO E-3 fleet enabling contingency operations, to include participation in the NATO Response Force (NRF), beyond NATO Area of Operations while continuing to maintain a level of security for the aircraft.  The FUP I project satisfies international airspace mandates for upgraded Communications Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) as well as transponder upgrades for Mode 5 and Enhanced Mode S.  Future efforts include but are not limited to FUP II efforts and other modernization projects.  These future projects will enable the aircraft to maintain interoperability, meet emerging military requirements and sustain the NATO fleet for the future needs of NATO.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","91-49340164b2405e286c156ddefaef2a5b5b974d96d579acdfbd26579afbdb36b0","root"

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national/theater intelligence and displays air/land/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI/CTII are roll-on/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","91-49340164b2405e286c156ddefaef2a5b5b974d96d579acdfbd26579afbdb36b0","root"

This funding supports the standup of the Sensor Depots required for the highly capable Global Hawk System.  The aircraft is fully autonomous, high altitude, long endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The RQ-4A is an imagery-intelligence (IMINT) RPA designed to employ 2000 pounds of payload. The RQ-4A has one configuration known as the Block 10. The Block 10 employs an IMINT system comprised of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and an electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) sensor. These three sensors are called the integrated sensor suite (ISS). The RQ-4B RPA is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT)collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors known as the enhanced ISS (EISS) in an IMINT only configuration. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and also integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor suite simultaneously to be used as a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 will only integrate the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. The user will ultimately determine the optimal quantities and payloads for each aircraft configuration based on operational requirements. The ground station (GS) includes the mission control element (MCE) and the launch and recovery element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable the Global Hawk System.  This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 0305220F and PE 0304260F.

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national/theater intelligence and displays air/land/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI/CTII are roll-on/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","189-ceb2a24c84354171e32e18821d027242228ebeb6982b23cd59c2a993a2d9981e","root"

This funding supports the standup of the Sensor Depots required for the highly capable Global Hawk System.  The aircraft is fully autonomous, high altitude, long endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The RQ-4A is an imagery-intelligence (IMINT) RPA designed to employ 2000 pounds of payload. The RQ-4A has one configuration known as the Block 10. The Block 10 employs an IMINT system comprised of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and an electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) sensor. These three sensors are called the integrated sensor suite (ISS). The RQ-4B RPA is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT)collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors known as the enhanced ISS (EISS) in an IMINT only configuration. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and also integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor suite simultaneously to be used as a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 will only integrate the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. The user will ultimately determine the optimal quantities and payloads for each aircraft configuration based on operational requirements. The ground station (GS) includes the mission control element (MCE) and the launch and recovery element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable the Global Hawk System.  This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 0305220F and PE 0304260F.

Special Operations Command Variant (SOC) refers to the SOCOM variant that has options dependent upon the SOCOM community to distinguish what specific options are required when the order is placed.    3.

Previous P-DOC submission included FY11 OCO funding of $13.54M under the M1165A1B3 SOC Variant HMMWV for 67 vehicles. Based on the information known at the time the funds were requested by the MAJCOM, the MAJCOM vehicle requirements was moved to fund 75 vehicles under the M1165A1B3 AFP Variant HMMWV.   Previous P-DOC submission did not reflect the OGPK being procured seperately from the M1165A1B3 AFP Variant HMMWV.

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national/theater intelligence and displays air/land/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI/CTII are roll-on/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","701-d7add933a08db6b5644e2acfb70e3c27b75d859b82e82905bdea512608d19de0","root"

Both categories not only reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, they also reduce cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as buyer of products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities.  These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities.  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments.  The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs.  These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders.  These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants.  In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability.  This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","701-d7add933a08db6b5644e2acfb70e3c27b75d859b82e82905bdea512608d19de0","root"

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national/theater intelligence and displays air/land/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI/CTII are roll-on/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","748-25e2b36667b93f0fe38588801ec1f050f0027ba5d24afb809161250fe9c35e48","root"

This funding supports the standup of the Sensor Depots required for the highly capable Global Hawk System.  The aircraft is fully autonomous, high altitude, long endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The RQ-4A is an imagery-intelligence (IMINT) RPA designed to employ 2000 pounds of payload. The RQ-4A has one configuration known as the Block 10. The Block 10 employs an IMINT system comprised of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and an electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) sensor. These three sensors are called the integrated sensor suite (ISS). The RQ-4B RPA is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT)collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors known as the enhanced ISS (EISS) in an IMINT only configuration. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and also integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor suite simultaneously to be used as a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 will only integrate the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. The user will ultimately determine the optimal quantities and payloads for each aircraft configuration based on operational requirements. The ground station (GS) includes the mission control element (MCE) and the launch and recovery element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable the Global Hawk System.

Both categories not only reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, they also reduce cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as buyer of products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities.  These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities.  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments.  The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs.  These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders.  These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants.  In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability.  This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","748-25e2b36667b93f0fe38588801ec1f050f0027ba5d24afb809161250fe9c35e48","root"

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national/theater intelligence and displays air/land/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI/CTII are roll-on/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.

This funding supports the standup of the Sensor Depots required for the highly capable Global Hawk System.  The aircraft is fully autonomous, high altitude, long endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The RQ-4A is an imagery-intelligence (IMINT) RPA designed to employ 2000 pounds of payload. The RQ-4A has one configuration known as the Block 10. The Block 10 employs an IMINT system comprised of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and an electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) sensor. These three sensors are called the integrated sensor suite (ISS). The RQ-4B RPA is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT)collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors known as the enhanced ISS (EISS) in an IMINT only configuration. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and also integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor suite simultaneously to be used as a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 will only integrate the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. The user will ultimately determine the optimal quantities and payloads for each aircraft configuration based on operational requirements. The ground station (GS) includes the mission control element (MCE) and the launch and recovery element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable the Global Hawk System.

Both categories not only reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, they also reduce cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as buyer of products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities.  These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities.  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments.  The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs.  These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders.  These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants.  In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability.  This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","795-27179c7323c4bb40c553127359c00fe0a6e91c82586c4c045d8d70bb07fce1e9","root"

PMA Justification: Purpose: The Vehicle Transportation Acquisition Council (VTAC) Conference provides the opportunity for M-Series program office representatives to brief vehicle acquisitions, delivery schedules, sustainment issues, advanced capabilities, and future of the M-Series program to the USAF MAJCOMs. Latest technical solutions to vehicle issues are also briefed. The M-Series program office representatives will also be afforded the opportunity to entertain questions and concerns posed by the users.   Impact if PMA is not funded: The MAJCOMs and users will not gain complete, up-to-date M-Series program insight. Any concerns and questions that could potentially affect all USAF users will have to be communicated via email or phone. This may lead to a communication gap and stakeholders not gaining pertinent information.  Items of interest may be elevated by users and MAJCOMs that could have been resolved at the VTAC.  Purpose: M-Series Program Management Reviews (PMRs) are held on a quarterly basis to discuss the future of the M-Series program, production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts. Our program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation at TACOM led PMR discussions. In addition to attending the PMR, our team will have the opportunity to have face-to-face discussions with our TACOM counterparts to entertain items not on the PMR agenda. Our program manager will be able to discuss programmatic issues. Our USAF engineer will be able to meet with the engineering community to pose technical questions and concerns as well as to stay in tune with the latest M-Series issues and technological advancements. Our USAF item manager will also be able to compare spreadsheets with TACOM budget analysts and map way head for future procurements.  Impact if PMA is not funded: In order to provide USAF programmatic/technical representation at subject PMRs, the WR-ALC M-Series program team has dialed in to several M-Series PMR teleconferences. Unfortunately, the poor telecommunication network setup prevents our team from clearly hearing the discussions held by all parties and seeing visual aids made only available to those in physical attendance. USAF directed questions that could have been answered at the PMR have to be entertained after the PMR via email or PMR minutes. At times, this causes delays in production and resolving issues with the users in the field.  Purpose: The Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Conference is hosted annually to enhance the security of the United States by promoting communications and interaction between the defense industry, government and military in the area of military specific automotive activities. Research, design, development, test and production of advanced automotive technology are presented at the conference. The presented information and open discussions are valuable to program managers and engineers. Due to the mass attendance of multi-services, it is critical that the USAF M-Series program office has programmatic/technical representatives at the conference to address issues and capability requirements, as well as deter users from committing the USAF to acquisition of unapproved products and/or services being offered by the defense industry.  Impact if PMA is not funded: There will be zero USAF Tactical Wheeled Vehicle program office representation to address USAF specific issues and capability requirements. The program office will be unaware of the latest technological advancements and the potential future paths other military services may take. Of particular interest would be the US Army which maintains majority of the tactical wheeled vehicle program acquisition and engineering authority. USAF users may unintentionally commit the USAF to acquisition of unapproved products and/or services offered by the defense industry.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","973-97a60e7fd198f9bc389de568b9e99e35a0ac59c6812a1f6256477cb1b3eb4e1c","root"

PMA Justification:  Purpose: M-Series Program Management Reviews (PMRs) are held on a quarterly basis to discuss the future of the M-Series program, production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts. Our program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation at TACOM led PMR discussions. In addition to attending the PMR, our team will have the opportunity to have face-to-face discussions with our TACOM counterparts to entertain items not on the PMR agenda. Our program manager will be able to discuss programmatic issues and way head for the M-Series program as TACOM redirects its focus toward acquisition of the JLTV. Our USAF engineer will be able to meet with the engineering community to pose technical questions and concerns as well as to stay in tune with the latest M-Series issues and technological advancements. Our USAF item manager will also be able to compare spreadsheets with TACOM budget analysts and map way head for HMMWV and OGPK production.   Impact if PMA is not funded: TACOM has informed our team that the US ARMY is wrapping up their HMMWV production. The USAF still has multiple HMMWV productions orders on contract that will need USAF representation at PMRs as TACOM redirects its focus.In order to provide USAF programmatic/technical representation at subject PMRs, the WR-ALC M-Series program team has dialed in to several M-Series PMR teleconferences. Unfortunately, the poor telecommunication network setup prevents our team from clearly hearing the discussions held by all parties and seeing visual aids made only available to those in physical attendance. USAF directed questions that could have been answered at the PMR have to be entertained after the PMR via email or PMR minutes. At times, this causes delays in production and resolving issues such as integrating the USAF OGPK production and delivery schedule with the USAF HMMWV production schedule.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1006-c9a04bc3dfa4a72a86a4d4b7a3aa59e86d2f8e4fa6620a2a539241d5874fd58b","root"

PMA Justification: Purpose: The Vehicle Transportation Acquisition Council (VTAC) Conference provides the opportunity for M-Series program office representatives to brief vehicle acquisitions, delivery schedules, sustainment issues, advanced capabilities, and future of the M-Series program to the USAF MAJCOMs. Latest technical solutions to vehicle issues are also briefed. The M-Series program office representatives will also be afforded the opportunity to entertain questions and concerns posed by the users.   Impact if PMA is not funded: The MAJCOMs and users will not gain complete, up-to-date M-Series program insight. Any concerns and questions that could potentially affect all USAF users will have to be communicated via email or phone. This may lead to a communication gap and stakeholders not gaining pertinent information.  Items of interest may be elevated by users and MAJCOMs that could have been resolved at the VTAC.  Purpose: M-Series Program Management Reviews (PMRs) are held on a quarterly basis to discuss the future of the M-Series program, production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts. Our program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation at TACOM led PMR discussions. In addition to attending the PMR, our team will have the opportunity to have face-to-face discussions with our TACOM counterparts to entertain items not on the PMR agenda. Our program manager will be able to discuss programmatic issues. Our USAF engineer will be able to meet with the engineering community to pose technical questions and concerns as well as to stay in tune with the latest M-Series issues and technological advancements. Our USAF item manager will also be able to compare spreadsheets with TACOM budget analysts and map way head for future procurements.  Impact if PMA is not funded: In order to provide USAF programmatic/technical representation at subject PMRs, the WR-ALC M-Series program team has dialed in to several M-Series PMR teleconferences. Unfortunately, the poor telecommunication network setup prevents our team from clearly hearing the discussions held by all parties and seeing visual aids made only available to those in physical attendance. USAF directed questions that could have been answered at the PMR have to be entertained after the PMR via email or PMR minutes. At times, this causes delays in production and resolving issues with the users in the field.  Purpose: The Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Conference is hosted annually to enhance the security of the United States by promoting communications and interaction between the defense industry, government and military in the area of military specific automotive activities. Research, design, development, test and production of advanced automotive technology are presented at the conference. The presented information and open discussions are valuable to program managers and engineers. Due to the mass attendance of multi-services, it is critical that the USAF M-Series program office has programmatic/technical representatives at the conference to address issues and capability requirements, as well as deter users from committing the USAF to acquisition of unapproved products and/or services being offered by the defense industry.  Impact if PMA is not funded: There will be zero USAF Tactical Wheeled Vehicle program office representation to address USAF specific issues and capability requirements. The program office will be unaware of the latest technological advancements and the potential future paths other military services may take. Of particular interest would be the US Army which maintains majority of the tactical wheeled vehicle program acquisition and engineering authority. USAF users may unintentionally commit the USAF to acquisition of unapproved products and/or services offered by the defense industry.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1037-6efcdc6f30f661146575694a73fe917c3bb9b80971e93170aec3d90c68e27850","root"

PMA Justification:  Purpose: M-Series Program Management Reviews (PMRs) are held on a quarterly basis to discuss the future of the M-Series program, production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts. Our program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation at TACOM led PMR discussions. In addition to attending the PMR, our team will have the opportunity to have face-to-face discussions with our TACOM counterparts to entertain items not on the PMR agenda. Our program manager will be able to discuss programmatic issues and way head for the M-Series program as TACOM redirects its focus toward acquisition of the JLTV. Our USAF engineer will be able to meet with the engineering community to pose technical questions and concerns as well as to stay in tune with the latest M-Series issues and technological advancements. Our USAF item manager will also be able to compare spreadsheets with TACOM budget analysts and map way head for HMMWV and OGPK production.   Impact if PMA is not funded: TACOM has informed our team that the US ARMY is wrapping up their HMMWV production. The USAF still has multiple HMMWV productions orders on contract that will need USAF representation at PMRs as TACOM redirects its focus.In order to provide USAF programmatic/technical representation at subject PMRs, the WR-ALC M-Series program team has dialed in to several M-Series PMR teleconferences. Unfortunately, the poor telecommunication network setup prevents our team from clearly hearing the discussions held by all parties and seeing visual aids made only available to those in physical attendance. USAF directed questions that could have been answered at the PMR have to be entertained after the PMR via email or PMR minutes. At times, this causes delays in production and resolving issues such as integrating the USAF OGPK production and delivery schedule with the USAF HMMWV production schedule.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1070-dc665570726aba18e49ecf108cba4ce0e121f9c245bb11a6371bf1a703eefb95","root"

These computers and networks integrated together provide CAPE analysts with the ability to support mission functions, such as Program Review, Program Objective Memorandum (POM) coordination, the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), and collecting, maintaining, and analyzing Defense Cost and Resource Center (DCARC) data.  In addition, these sophisticated computer tools allow CAPE analysts to conduct research, studies, technical analyses, and collaborative studies within CAPE and with other DoD agencies, and provide analysts with the flexibility of running simulation models to produce valid analyses.  Decrease from FY12 to FY13: As a result of consolidation with OSD CIO for enterprise IT services directed by the Secretary of Defense initiatives, CAPE reduced requirements and its overall IT hardware and software acquistion budget by $1M annually through the FYDP, beginning in FY13.     Explanation of FY13 to FY14:  The program continues to maintain efficiencies established by the Secretary's initiatives across the FYDP and accomplish the objectives and mission requirements of the program.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1584-55e3b53832c0b95f2def3d106bafe29fd9ef2001e1b14a442bfa528df2bed312","root"

These computers and networks integrated together provide CAPE analysts with the ability to support mission functions, such as Program Review, Program Objective Memorandum (POM) coordination, the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), and collecting, maintaining, and analyzing Defense Cost and Resource Center (DCARC) data.  In addition, these sophisticated computer tools allow CAPE analysts to conduct research, studies, technical analyses, and collaborative studies within CAPE and with other DoD agencies, and provide analysts with the flexibility of running simulation models to produce valid analyses.  Decrease from FY12 to FY13: As a result of consolidation with OSD CIO for enterprise IT services directed by the Secretary of Defense initiatives, CAPE reduced requirements and its overall IT hardware and software acquistion budget by $1M annually through the FYDP, beginning in FY13.     Explanation of FY13 to FY14:  The program continues to maintain efficiencies established by the Secretary's initiatives across the FYDP and accomplish the objectives and mission requirements of the program.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1586-c2b4e086eff66511044aceb4ab6a8a5dafcc9ce08514b8ddab520b42bd53e980","root"

It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired. _____  Schedules and quantities are adjusted based upon COCOM priorities.","","","30.859","22.449","","","15.813","","15.813","","","","","","","","1802-89f2600d7608064185f9091e11be781e0c65cca46ed29a20d26fec77bb658f4c","root"

Unit costs for FY16 are assumed and are subject to change.  In FY12, a contract vehicle has been established to procure additional commercial air conditioners as warranted by analysis and need. The COTS large air conditioner will be bought through the GSA contract (Aero Specialties).   PMA Justification:  Purpose: As part of the contractual requirement, PMA will be used to support quarterly Program Management Reviews (PMRs) to discuss production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts to the program. PMA will also be used to support all testing required to field a system. The program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation to attend Preliminary Design Reviews, Critical Design Reviews, First Article Testing, Provisioning, Technical Order Verification and conduct technical/program interchange meetings.   Impact if PMA not funded:  The USAF will not be able to meet the governments contractual requirement that could potentially delay fielding or result in fielding a substandard piece of equipment. If travel is not funded, the Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness will not have government witness and inherent government responsibility to prevent fraud waste and abuse. Provisioning is critical in sustaining a system. If parts are not provisioned correctly and sources identified, failures of small normal replacement items will result in increased downtime. This will cause the warfighter to go directly to the manufacture, bypassing the defense supply system resulting in increased cost per item.","","","10.524","0","","","0.222","","0.222","","","","","0","","","2876-91aed1c6c2a08a228b8c7c4eed50581f764cf67caa4118d9b1451a33406b00c2","root"

These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities. They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants.

Both categories not only reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, they also reduce cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as buyer of products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities.  These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities.  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments.  The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs.  These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders.  These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants.  In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability.  This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired. _____  Schedules and quantities are adjusted based upon COCOM priorities.","","","13.223","70.813","","","7.464","","7.464","","","","","0","","","2890-f27b5efe7b0a7b8328a9a1db214d76ba09b7ee4a6dfb6b1b537890816fd1acd1","root"

Unit costs for FY16 are assumed and are subject to change.  In FY12, a contract vehicle has been established to procure additional commercial air conditioners as warranted by analysis and need. The COTS large air conditioner will be bought through the GSA contract (Aero Specialties).   PMA Justification:  Purpose: As part of the contractual requirement, PMA will be used to support quarterly Program Management Reviews (PMRs) to discuss production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts to the program. PMA will also be used to support all testing required to field a system. The program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation to attend Preliminary Design Reviews, Critical Design Reviews, First Article Testing, Provisioning, Technical Order Verification and conduct technical/program interchange meetings.   Impact if PMA not funded:  The USAF will not be able to meet the governments contractual requirement that could potentially delay fielding or result in fielding a substandard piece of equipment. If travel is not funded, the Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness will not have government witness and inherent government responsibility to prevent fraud waste and abuse. Provisioning is critical in sustaining a system. If parts are not provisioned correctly and sources identified, failures of small normal replacement items will result in increased downtime. This will cause the warfighter to go directly to the manufacture, bypassing the defense supply system resulting in increased cost per item.","","","10.524","0","","","0.222","","0.222","","","","","0","","","2903-a0f51551ebdd7ad9dee6802ea86b591ee77185b264484fc5ac7f75b52225d915","root"

They are now Client only sites, and point to Commands like AMC and USAFE for their GCCS capabilities/functionality. The next infrastructure release to any Command will be for GCCS-J GR 6.0 X86 (late FY15 and FY16), and ANG and AFRC are not slated for those new enclave suites.  With the $5M cut projected in FY16 3080, we will be unable to field GCCS-J v6.0 to the following sites (critical sites marked with *): *Headquarters Special Operations Command Central (HQ SOCCENT) - Deployed *Headquarters U.S. Central Command (HQ USCENTCOM) - Deployed *Air Force Targeting Center (AFTC), Langley AFB, VA *20 Intelligence Squadron, Offutt AFB *Raven Rock Mountain Complex (SITE R), PA AFISRA (AIA (NC)) 25th Air Force Air Education Training Command (AETC) Schoolhouse Headquarters Fourteenth Air Force (HQ 14AF) Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) Air Force Space Command Center (AFSPC) 36th AEW 18th Wing 8th Fighter Wing 35th Fighter Wing Headquarters Seventh Air Force (HQ 7AF) Hawaii (HIRAOC) Headquarters Fifth Air Force (HQ 5AF) Headquarters Alaskan Command (HQ ALCOM/HQ 11AF)  GCCS-AF PMO is the AF's sole agent for fielding GCCS-J. As such, we must provide the hardware, software, and engineering expertise and manpower to field GCCS-J to all AF locations except AOCs as well as the 5 Combatant Commands that the AF is responsible for. Our purchase schedule is driven in part by DISA's fielding schedule for critical sites. Fielding to the critical sites is executed by DISA and we must provide the hardware and software to those sites in advance of Dis As fielding dates. In the past, DISA has fielded to critical sites in the 6 months following an FRR which means that we will need to begin providing hardware/software in early FY16.","","","13.559","9.098","","","7.212","","7.212","","","","","0","","","3083-1a637b00cfeaca88feca7014945a6bf37861a3e29f63462246c8d652fb3f3af2","root"

The C4/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be sustained and upgraded to meet the ever increasing demands of enduring operations and the growth of data storage requirements, as well as emergent cyber threats.

They are now Client only sites, and point to Commands like AMC and USAFE for their GCCS capabilities/functionality. The next infrastructure release to any Command will be for GCCS-J GR 6.0 X86 (late FY15 and FY16), and ANG and AFRC are not slated for those new enclave suites.  With the $5M cut projected in FY16 3080, we will be unable to field GCCS-J v6.0 to the following sites (critical sites marked with *): *Headquarters Special Operations Command Central (HQ SOCCENT) - Deployed *Headquarters U.S. Central Command (HQ USCENTCOM) - Deployed *Air Force Targeting Center (AFTC), Langley AFB, VA *20 Intelligence Squadron, Offutt AFB *Raven Rock Mountain Complex (SITE R), PA AFISRA (AIA (NC)) 25th Air Force Air Education Training Command (AETC) Schoolhouse Headquarters Fourteenth Air Force (HQ 14AF) Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) Air Force Space Command Center (AFSPC) 36th AEW 18th Wing 8th Fighter Wing 35th Fighter Wing Headquarters Seventh Air Force (HQ 7AF) Hawaii (HIRAOC) Headquarters Fifth Air Force (HQ 5AF) Headquarters Alaskan Command (HQ ALCOM/HQ 11AF)  GCCS-AF PMO is the AF's sole agent for fielding GCCS-J. As such, we must provide the hardware, software, and engineering expertise and manpower to field GCCS-J to all AF locations except AOCs as well as the 5 Combatant Commands that the AF is responsible for. Our purchase schedule is driven in part by DISA's fielding schedule for critical sites. Fielding to the critical sites is executed by DISA and we must provide the hardware and software to those sites in advance of Dis As fielding dates. In the past, DISA has fielded to critical sites in the 6 months following an FRR which means that we will need to begin providing hardware/software in early FY16.","","","13.559","9.098","","","7.212","","7.212","","","","","0","","","3153-8c8726d3a544c4f9e69dadde9e3b0ff94b40122c4cbfb58384f01998077dcae7","root"

Funding is vital to effectively conduct communications support missions impacting Command and Control (C2) and operational missions conducted by the Commander and staff supporting the Command's CONPLAN/OPLANs.  The C4/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be sustained and upgraded to meet the ever increasing demands of enduring operations and the growth of data storage requirements, as well as emergent cyber threats.  Without OPAF funding, the vital life cycle replacement of communications equipment directly supporting all C2 and C4 operations will be at significant risk and will catastrophically affect the ability of enduring operational missions across the AOR.","","0","3.761","3.823","","","2.509","","2.509","","","","","","","","3171-daf06bd259ac358ab93e5bcc4c20879ea78770b91e749e7665f4796e16ad9d29","root"

We are completing the system modification necessary for the Procurement Data Standardization (PDS).  DCMA will need to purchase and deploy a Contract Writing/Administration System (CWAS) that can collect and prepopulate Contract PDS data from the DoD system of records by the time PDS goes Department-wide.  The DCMA CWS Contract Writing System (CWAS) that will streamline the Contract Modification process and alert our DoD customers of the modification as well as automate the obligation of funds to that customer's financial recording system in accordance with the Procure-to-Pay Handshake guidance.   This effort will help to reduce system and data redundancy and aid in the consolidation of systems within DCMA's portfolio as well as alleviate the need for two different Contracting system procurements.  DCMA's primary focus from FY16 through FY 20 is to invigorate efforts to adjust to the changing environment by creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  We are centered on the reengineering of DCMA's Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide the needed capabilities.  Our goal is to streamline the business processes and consolidate the toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.  This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.  OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements.","","","","","","","4.497","","4.497","","","","","","","","3819-aa6201b276df0af676871a11e4d79d5e5f07e6ecbc0877523c5a5c0bb990014d","root"

These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities and weapon systems (WS).  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and WS life cycle costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced operation & maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Prior to FY15, these funds were previously provided through PE 078054F.  Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F.","","","3.502","2.897","","","2.305","","2.305","","","","","0","","","3819-aa6201b276df0af676871a11e4d79d5e5f07e6ecbc0877523c5a5c0bb990014d","root"

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired.  FY17 OCO funds of $8.4M will be used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search.  Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.  The capability will prevent  potential eye damage to friendly forces during ID of targets in urban Environments.     _____  Schedules and quantities are adjusted based upon COCOM priorities.","","","67.218","7.464","","","15.749","","24.149","","","","","8.4","","","3819-aa6201b276df0af676871a11e4d79d5e5f07e6ecbc0877523c5a5c0bb990014d","root"

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.  This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.  OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements.","","","","","","","4.497","","4.497","","","","","","","","3891-5b9700705b8c430e599e5e19b9e10c185e21cefa5e6687ca10dee3b5028333ec","root"

These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities and weapon systems (WS).  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and WS life cycle costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced operation & maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.  This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.  OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements.","","","","","","","4.497","","4.497","","","","","","","","3919-a71623d781e1d896cbd5102d3804e20ebd76b45137373306a73ec019f07e92f8","root"

These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities and weapon systems (WS).  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and WS life cycle costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced operation & maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Prior to FY15, these funds were previously provided through PE 078054F.

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired.  FY17 OCO funds of $8.4M will be used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search.  Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.  The capability will prevent  potential eye damage to friendly forces during ID of targets in urban Environments.     _____  Schedules and quantities are adjusted based upon COCOM priorities.","","","67.218","7.464","","","15.749","","24.149","","","","","8.4","","","3919-a71623d781e1d896cbd5102d3804e20ebd76b45137373306a73ec019f07e92f8","root"

Funding is vital to effectively conduct communications support missions impacting Command and Control (C2) and operational missions conducted by the Commander and staff supporting the Command's CONPLAN/OPLANs.  The C4/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be replaced to meet the ever increasing demands of enduring operations and the growth of data storage requirements, as well as emergent cyber threats.  Without OPAF funding, the vital life cycle replacement of communications equipment directly supporting all C2 and C4 operations will be at significant risk and will catastrophically affect the ability of enduring operational missions across the AOR.","","0","3.823","2.509","","","4.736","","4.736","","","","","0","","","4162-9538d0a7e8c16c9f76c6383b4b4af1b96acc933d6fa2c717e54671a4b6a5fc48","root"

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.  This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.  OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements.","","","","4.497","","","","","","","","","","","","","4890-889bca2c272ac7acf9514aa9587eea6f5e1a3dd0ba75be69c47422580a8e1b12","root"

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.  FY17 OCO funds of $8.4M will be used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search.  Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.  This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.  OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft.

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.  FY17 OCO funds of $8.4M will be used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search.  Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.  The capability will prevent  potential eye damage to friendly forces during ID of targets in urban Environments.     _____  Schedules and quantities are adjusted based upon COCOM priorities.","","","14.024","24.149","","","0","","0","","","","","","","","4974-8409d68f03a0bd7739ce7686dda07773e438c22e21937932c722be86d5763681","root"

The JPF is compatible with MK-80 series guided and unguided bombs. It has replaced and/or supplemented the FMU-139A/B and FMU-139C/B, FMU-143, FMU-124, and M904/M905 fuzes, and provides the next generation of fuzing capability for hard target, general purpose, and guided bombs.

This fuze marries the AF FMU-152A/B and the Navy FMU-139C/B specs for a better buying power business case. Currently the Navy will not purchase/utilize the JPF due to safety concerns regarding the battery. These safety concerns are specific to the Navy employment and do no impact the Air Force. The contract for this effort was competitively awarded 17 SEP 15. The new design is currently being qualified and tested with production anticipated in FY18 & beyond. Because the design change is a re-packaging of current technology the program office was approved by their PEO to use production funds for the minimal NRE required.","","","8.595","4.105","","","0","","0","","","","","","","","5034-a087d0ee1badd39b367b0c7cc0c3424732ebeac3268c5ed38b7ad18d7f41c4ef","root"

Since its inception JIDO has reduced the time to field solutions to engaged units by more than 50 percent since 2007.  JIDO's unique rapid requirements process enables validation of immediate needs and application of resources to develop solutions.  The organization maintains a critical embedded presence with deployed U.S. joint forces, which allows the organization to identify and begin development of solutions before the formal Urgent or Emergent Operational Needs Statement (UONS/EONS) assignments occur.  JIDO employs an open, internal governance process to validate all requirements.  This process is executed in coordination with the affected CCMD, the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, the Functional Capabilities Board, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, the Military Departments/Services, and Congress.

Airborne tactical Datalink messaging will be enabled via Link 16 waveform, providing the ability for the AV-8B to provide Precise Participant Location and Identification (PPLI), send and receive targeting information, view the common air/surface picture, and view Link surveillance tracks.  This tactical data communication between the AV-8B, ground units, and joint assets will provide increased interoperability, improved safety/situational awareness/deconfliction, reduced kill timelines, and digital interoperability.  Link 16 A and B kits will be incorporated into the aircraft via ECP.  ECPs to include but not limited to the Auxiliary Communications Navigation Identification Panel (ACNIP),  Interference Blanker Unit (IBU) and the Mission Systems Computer (MSC) will also be required to be installed prior to or with Link 16 in order to utilize the capability, as will the APX-123 ECP, to be procured by PMA213.  All ECPs will require NRE and logistics support elements to include tech data/pubs, ILS, training equipment/upgrade, support equipment procurement/modification and other support.  This OSIP will also be used to perform efforts to address certifications / re-certification and spectrum assignments of these systems, as well as parts obsolescence. FY17 provides funding for procurement of aircraft A-kit, as well as Link 16 B kit; and logistics elements to include support equipment procurement and support and aircrew and maintenance trainer upgrades, associated to the Link 16 and IBU ECPs, as well as Link 16 impact to H6.2 software ECP, as Link 16 functionality is enabled by and integrated via H6.2 OFP.  FY18 will perform installations of Link 16 A kits, will begin Link 16 upgrades to meet crypto modernization standards, logistics elements required to field systems to include support equipment and trainer upgrades associated to the Link 16 ECP as well as perform logistics elements and configuration management activities for the Link 16 impact to H6.2 and H7.0 software ECPs.  As the Link 16 functionality is enabled by H6.2 software, and Link 16 capability is upgraded by the H7.0 software,  this OSIP supports the validation and configuration management of the Link 16 and aircraft OFP software as impacted by Link 16.  Technology upgrades at COTS vendor drives software changes to Link 16, which will be integrated via H7.0.  Funds will be utilized to manage, process, and incorporate digital interoperability ECPs and implement changes to sustain and improve the digital interoperability systems readiness including safety, mission availability, system employment, and component reliability, maintainability, and obsolescence conditions as these emerging deficiencies arise and require modification.  This funding will ensure that software is upgraded and integrated, and logistically supported to ensure the LINK 16 capabilities are integrated with aircraft OFPs.  DEVELOPMENT STATUS/MAJOR DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES: Procurement, installation, ILS, publication updates, trainer updates, and support equipment upgrades continue for the Digital Interoperability required IBU ECP and the Link 16 and associated OFP integration Digital Interoperability ECPs in FY17.

This funding is for Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) development, A-kit procurement and installation of a Direct Infrared Counter Measure (DIRCM) system for H-53s. This system will help protect the H-53 which is highly susceptible to IR seeking Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS), the weapon of choice in all current theaters. This system has been found effective against fourth generation IR MANPADS, and is extremely effective against earlier generation MANPADS.  DEVELOPMENT STATUS/MAJOR DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES: Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) for the CH-53E began in May 07 and concluded with a completed and verified Technical Directive in early FY09. Test and Evaluation for the CH-53E began with risk-reduction testing in April 08 and concluded with Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in late FY09.  Critical to early fielding was the Quick reaction assessment, completed in August 08 which led to an Early Operational Capability (EOC) decision in November 08.  Validation and verification were conducted for the CH-53E between May - September 08.  Non-Recurring engineering for the CH-53D began in May 08 and concluded with a completed and verified TD in early FY10. The FY11 United States Marine Corps Aviation Plan was released in October 2010 and called for the early retirement of the CH-53D. Development and deployment of the DIRCM system on the CH-53D system was subsequently suspended and the remaining funding was realigned to other priorities consistent with Headquarters Marine Corps direction.  DIRCM is being procured as a mission kit by PMA-272.  CH-53Es must be modified with an A-kit to accept the mission kit.     JUSTIFICATION FOR REQUIREMENTS AND CHANGES: This OSIP decreases $0.339M (34.4%) from FY2017 to FY2018. Decrease is a result of limited installations taking place due to aircraft availability.   Notes: 1. Due to PY OCO funding allocations, kits were procured in PY and installs are taking place based on fleet need and aircraft availability.  2. Cost Element 1.1.1, Cost Element 1.1.2 and Cost Element 1.1.3 DIRCM basic and Rev A installs differ substantially in cost.

Airborne tactical Datalink messaging will be enabled via Link 16 waveform, providing the ability for the AV-8B to provide Precise Participant Location and Identification (PPLI), send and receive targeting information, view the common air/surface picture, and view Link surveillance tracks.  This tactical data communication between the AV-8B, ground units, and joint assets will provide increased interoperability, improved safety/situational awareness/deconfliction, reduced kill timelines, and digital interoperability.  Link 16 A and B kits will be incorporated into the aircraft via ECP.  ECPs to include but not limited to the Auxiliary Communications Navigation Identification Panel (ACNIP),  Interference Blanker Unit (IBU) and the Mission Systems Computer (MSC) will also be required to be installed prior to or with Link 16 in order to utilize the capability, as will the APX-123 ECP, to be procured by PMA213.  All ECPs will require NRE and logistics support elements to include tech data/pubs, ILS, training equipment/upgrade, support equipment procurement/modification and other support.  This OSIP will also be used to perform efforts to address certifications / re-certification and spectrum assignments of these systems, as well as parts obsolescence. FY17 provides funding for procurement of aircraft A-kit, as well as Link 16 B kit; and logistics elements to include support equipment procurement and support and aircrew and maintenance trainer upgrades, associated to the Link 16 and IBU ECPs, as well as Link 16 impact to H6.2 software ECP, as Link 16 functionality is enabled by and integrated via H6.2 OFP.  FY18 will perform installations of Link 16 A kits, will begin Link 16 upgrades to meet crypto modernization standards, logistics elements required to field systems to include support equipment and trainer upgrades associated to the Link 16 ECP as well as perform logistics elements and configuration management activities for the Link 16 impact to H6.2 and H7.0 software ECPs.  As the Link 16 functionality is enabled by H6.2 software, and Link 16 capability is upgraded by the H7.0 software,  this OSIP supports the validation and configuration management of the Link 16 and aircraft OFP software as impacted by Link 16.  Technology upgrades at COTS vendor drives software changes to Link 16, which will be integrated via H7.0.  Funds will be utilized to manage, process, and incorporate digital interoperability ECPs and implement changes to sustain and improve the digital interoperability systems readiness including safety, mission availability, system employment, and component reliability, maintainability, and obsolescence conditions as these emerging deficiencies arise and require modification.  This funding will ensure that software is upgraded and integrated, and logistically supported to ensure the LINK 16 capabilities are integrated with aircraft OFPs.  DEVELOPMENT STATUS/MAJOR DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES: Procurement, installation, ILS, publication updates, trainer updates, and support equipment upgrades continue for the Digital Interoperability required IBU ECP and the Link 16 and associated OFP integration Digital Interoperability ECPs in FY17.

Full incorporation of the IMD system capabilities will allow rapid transition from the current costly philosophies of the 70s to today's cost wise initiatives and concepts. Lessons learned from this effort were incorporated into the solicitation for the fleet wide IMD effort with CH/MH-53E aircraft designated as the lead platforms.  IMD produces the aircraft interface required to implement Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA), a capability designed to provide hazard monitoring and mitigation.  Additionally, IMDS includes support equipment for RTB, including Virtual Master Blade System (VMBS).  Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) is hosted within the aircraft IMDS/Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS), intended to direct maintenance by predicting failures based on real-time assessment of equipment condition obtained from Integrated Mechanical Diagnostics System (IMDS) embedded sensors.  CBM program includes software algorithm analysis for condition and health indicators of components,  implementation of diagnostic/analysis tools, regime recognition, and information infrastructure.  CBM will enable a reduction in spares and maintenance while increasing safety of flight.  DEVELOPMENT STATUS/MAJOR DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES:   The CH-53E IMDS successfully completed operational evaluation in October 2005.

Radios:  There are 75 sites which will receive a total of 4,498 radios.  The sites to receive radios include FACSFACs remote sites at Naval and Marine Corps Air Stations.  The number of radios per site varies due to operational requirements and the number of aircraft serviced.   Voice Switches:  There are two specific types of Voice Switches being procured: Operational Communication System (OCS) and Emergency Control System (ECS):  56 OCS Voice Switches, 42 ECS Voice Switches.    42 Sites will receive both an OCS Voice Switch and an ECS Voice Switch, 14 sites will receive only an OCS voice switch.  While FACSFAC remote sites are equipped with radios, they are not equipped with Voice Switches.

Quantities between radios and kits may change from year to year as a result of ship availabilities and fleet priority. FY18 Shore procurements reflect procurement of four (Qty 4) DMRs to support NCTAMS LANT relocation project. Installation costs will be supported by overall project dollars. FY 18 is procuring three (3 QTY) Afloat units of DMR IW & MUOS System. There are 4 different configurations of DMR IW & MUOS System  (2 surface, 1 subsurface & 1 shore) and 5 different configurations of DMR IW & MUOS Upgrade Kit configurations (3 surface & 2 subsurface). Annual Unit Cost variances are driven by system configurations.     For the DMR IW & MUOS System, the configuration ranges from 1 - 3 DMR systems and requires a unique set of ancillary equipment dependent upon ship class (racks, power amplifiers & antenna upgrades). For example, a CVN requires 3 DMR systems and would need 4 racks to complete installation. When comparing to a small ship such as LCS, which needs only 1 DMR system and 2 racks to complete installation. A single DMR system will range in cost depending on the configuration and Economic Order Quantity Pricing relevant at time of contract award.  All ancillary equipment is procured via separate contracts that will be subject to re-compete over the next two years. Components are provided to SSC Pacific for integration, assembly and test which comprises the 24 month lead time.  In FY18 DMR program plans to procure 7 DMR systems (3 subsurface and 4 shore).   Twenty four (24) month Production Lead Time (PLT) for DMR System delivery due to varying PLT's from multiple sub-component vendors that are then integrated into the final product. Seven (7) month Administrative Lead Time (ALT) for DMR System procurements allows for the identification and receipt of other customer funds in order to take advantage of favorable quantity pricing when available.","","14.41","6.596","13.151","","","9.456","","9.456","","","","","0","","","6042-8db66ef772edd892c8a68e4d73e16c77bc20cb41c450456d4d06ec9264d2ada4","root"

This system gathers and combines all Electric plant data so that it is available at any electric plant control station.  PMP simplifies multiple step control sequences into single step operations and makes possible control capabilities that were previously too cumbersome for operators to perform. i.e. Baseload, and Real / Reactive power balancing. PMP implements a gradual Ship Service Turbine Generator (SSTG) turbine startup/shutdown sequence which allows the turbine to achieve stabilized temperatures more consistently, reducing stress on components and contributing to prolonged service life.  System automation reduces electrical system transients and stress on breaker components by employing a Zero Power Transfer (ZPT) strategy, which limits the current flow through an individual breaker to zero during open/close evolutions.

Many of these switches are experiencing increasing obsolescence and failures and are in need of replacement. They are not capable of supporting flexible reallocation of access to communications resources, and lack security needed for a network-based communications infrastructure, which is a key concept in modernization of the NAS. The NVS program will provide a key transitional element in the air traffic control voice communications infrastructure as it moves toward realizing the FAAs NextGen vision and a more operationally efficient and economic NAS.

There are 4 different configurations of DMR IW & MUOS System  (2 surface, 1 subsurface & 1 shore) and 5 different configurations of DMR IW & MUOS Upgrade Kit configurations (3 surface & 2 subsurface). Annual Unit Cost variances are driven by system configurations.     For the DMR IW & MUOS System, the configuration ranges from 1 - 3 DMR systems and requires a unique set of ancillary equipment dependent upon ship class (racks, power amplifiers & antenna upgrades). For example, a CVN requires 3 DMR systems and would need 4 racks to complete installation. When comparing to a small ship such as LCS, which needs only 1 DMR system and 2 racks to complete installation. A single DMR system will range in cost depending on the configuration and Economic Order Quantity Pricing relevant at time of contract award.  All ancillary equipment is procured via separate contracts that will be subject to re-compete over the next two years. Components are provided to SSC Pacific for integration, assembly and test which comprises the 24 month lead time.  In FY18 DMR program plans to procure 7 DMR systems (3 subsurface and 4 shore).   Twenty four (24) month Production Lead Time (PLT) for DMR System delivery due to varying PLT's from multiple sub-component vendors that are then integrated into the final product. Seven (7) month Administrative Lead Time (ALT) for DMR System procurements allows for the identification and receipt of other customer funds in order to take advantage of favorable quantity pricing when available.","","14.41","6.596","13.151","","","9.456","","9.456","","","","","0","","","6194-e48163e42705323cd252e11680e40d549623601a48742ad52444a8f56b5b5268","root"

The modernization effort within C2OIX for afloat platforms replaces older Naval Modular Automated Communication System (NAVMACS) that lacked adherence to current cyber security requirements.  It also automates and increases the speed and efficiency of handling organizational message traffic aboard ships and submarines, as well as replaces ten NAVMACS surface shipboard variants distributed across United States Navy (USN), Military Sealift Command (MSC) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) ships with a single shipboard variant.  The ashore component of C2OIX Project is the IP-based C2OIX Shore Gateway system.  C2OIX will virtualize all Government Official Information Exchange System (GOES) software suites on shore gateway UNCLASSSIFIED, SECRET and TOP SECRET message enclaves and provide an integrated Cross Domain Solution (CDS) at the two Naval Computer Telecommunication Area Master Stations (NCTAMS PACIFIC and NCTAMS ATLANTIC).

A permanently installed Ship Alteration (SHIPALT) configuration for VIRGINIA Class Block I/II/III was developed and installations will start in FY17 (delayed from FY16 due because budget insufficient for installation cost estimates). A permanent SHIPALT for VIRGINIA Class Block IV will be developed in FY17 and installations will start in FY26, gradually phasing out the TEMPALTs on VIRGINIA Class. Reliability and refresh upgrades sustain current in-service AASP systems with new components and software updates to maintain reliability. Includes production support for BLK I-IV SHIPALTS and the AASP reliability and refurbishment upgrade. AASP includes costs of procuring new systems and reuse of available components, including the HLF-1, for SHIPALT installation such that unit cost is a mix of new and used components. An additional HLF-1 transducer (not a complete full system) is procured in FY17 ($587K) and FY19 ($610K). Reliability and refurbishment upgrade to sustain current in-service AASP systems.

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.  This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.  OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds.

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.  This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.  OC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds.

The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort will consist of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action will be done to fulfill the requirements of AFGSC.   The test sets will be used to test and functionally check out the MK12A and MK21 Reentry Systems and the MK12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections.  The test sets support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. The RSTC will be able to check-out all possible SERV RS configurations.  The MK12A Forward Section will be checked-out by the FSTS, allowing simultaneous processing efforts to take place, reducing overall processing time in the Weapon Storage Area.

The RSTS was built in the late 1960s, using early 1960s technology.  The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort will consist of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action will be done to fulfill the requirements of AFGSC.   The test sets will be used to test and functionally check out the MK12A and MK21 Reentry Systems and the MK12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections.  The test sets support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. The RSTC will be able to check-out all possible SERV RS configurations.  The MK12A Forward Section will be checked-out by the FSTS, allowing simultaneous processing efforts to take place, reducing overall processing time in the Weapon Storage Area.  The MK21 Forward Sections will continue to be checked by the current SERV Arming and Fuzing Assembly Test Set (AFATS).","","48.315","0.663","0.31","","","1.428","","1.428","","","","","","","","6586-67613af93f668990ff6e9b4158c9e65ec66f8281e906e66ced86c60cf032e199","root"

Mission Partner Environment (MPE) enables secure sharing of operational information for collaboration between and among the U.S. and mission partners to include federal, State, local, and tribal agencies, allies, coalition members, host nations, and other nations, United States and international Non-Governmental Organizations, multinational treaty organizations, and private sector organizations.  The MPE program enables the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD) to execute its assigned missions with mission partners across the complete ranges and phases of military operations to assist combined command and control (C2) of coalition forces while meeting the information sharing requirements within existing bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements. Also, it promotes effective information exchange and provides applications to enable effective use of the United States and Partner nation military power. MPE provides the warfighter mission with technology to improve mission effectiveness and cyber security.  In response to program decision memorandum, funding for Mission Partner Environment transferred the capabilities the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) program, the All Partners Access Network (APAN), and the Combined Federal Battle Labs Network (CBFLNet) to the Mission Partner Environment Program. MPE enables secure sharing of operational information and enhances collaboration between the US forces, and trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners. FY2019 funding procures hardware and software to support the consolidation of a common mission network capability that supports operations with the Mission Partners environment.","","","0","0","","","1.873","","1.873","","","","","0","","","6661-ea8c118659ee7a5800ed1887106f7c2a55380be0bbdb21000e56c4e313f9e9d8","root"

The RSTS was built in the late 1960s, using early 1960s technology.  The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort will consist of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action will be done to fulfill the requirements of AFGSC.   The test sets will be used to test and functionally check out the Mk12A and Mk21 Reentry Systems and the Mk12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections.  The test sets support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. The RSTC will be able to check-out all possible SERV Reentry System configurations.  The Mk12A Forward Section will be checked-out by the FSTS, allowing simultaneous processing efforts to take place, reducing overall processing time in the Weapon Storage Area.  The Mk21 Forward Sections will continue to be checked by the current SERV Arming and Fuzing Assembly Test Set.

The RSTS was built in the late 1960s, using early 1960s technology.  The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort will consist of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action will be done to fulfill the requirements of AFGSC.   The test sets will be used to test and functionally check out the Mk12A and Mk21 Reentry Systems and the Mk12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections.  The test sets support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. The RSTC will be able to check-out all possible SERV Reentry System configurations.  The Mk12A Forward Section will be checked-out by the FSTS, allowing simultaneous processing efforts to take place, reducing overall processing time in the Weapon Storage Area.  The Mk21 Forward Sections will continue to be checked by the current SERV Arming and Fuzing Assembly Test Set.  Justification: The RFSE replaces unsupportable and unreliable support equipment and is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) in 2036.

Mission Partner Environment (MPE) enables secure sharing of operational information for collaboration between and among the U.S. and mission partners to include federal, State, local, and tribal agencies, allies, coalition members, host nations, and other nations, United States and international Non-Governmental Organizations, multinational treaty organizations, and private sector organizations.  The MPE program enables the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD) to execute its assigned missions with mission partners across the complete ranges and phases of military operations to assist combined command and control (C2) of coalition forces while meeting the information sharing requirements within existing bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements. Also, it promotes effective information exchange and provides applications to enable effective use of the United States and Partner nation military power. MPE provides the warfighter mission with technology to improve mission effectiveness and cyber security.  In response to program decision memorandum, funding for Mission Partner Environment transferred the capabilities the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) program, the All Partners Access Network (APAN), and the Combined Federal Battle Labs Network (CBFLNet) to the Mission Partner Environment Program. MPE enables secure sharing of operational information and enhances collaboration between the US forces, and trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners.

These integrated computers and networks provide CAPE analysts with the ability to support mission functions such as:  Program Review support, Program Objective Memorandum (POM) coordination, Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) coordination, and the collection, maintenance, and analysis of Defense Cost and Resource Center (DCARC) data.  In addition, these sophisticated computer tools allow CAPE analysts to conduct research, studies, technical analyses, and collaborative studies within CAPE and with other DoD agencies, and provide analysts with the flexibility of running simulation models to produce valid analyses. FY 2020 funding continues to support the migration, implementation, and sustainment of CAPE';s DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts outside of the Joint Service Provider (JSP) DMZ.  CAPE will maintain a steady state Long Range Planning Procurement program throughout the outyears of the FY 2020-2024 FYDP.

Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation. Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).","","","","","","","8.206","","8.206","","","","","","","","8285-84ad9eb28db9f01bbadaa570cdd1c1caeed3409fb0c3aa867050e71d47d00a08","root"

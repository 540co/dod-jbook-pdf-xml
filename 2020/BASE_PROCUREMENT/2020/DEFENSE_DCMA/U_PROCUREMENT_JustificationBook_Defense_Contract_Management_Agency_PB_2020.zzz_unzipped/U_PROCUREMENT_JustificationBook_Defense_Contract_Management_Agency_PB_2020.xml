            </proc:ResourceSummary>
            <proc:Description>DCMA is currently engaged in several major initiatives to improve our information technology environment.  Information technology is the primary enabling capability our acquisition workforce is reliant upon to communicate with contractors, the DoD acquisition community and our customers.  These initiatives are driven by the National Defense Strategy business reform line of effort.  On December 21, 2017, the Reform Management Group directed the Information Technology (IT) and Business Systems Reform Lead to review Fourth Estate IT networks, policies, business processes, functions, costs and Chief Information Officer (CIO) organizational structures and manpower requirements across the Fourth Estate.  In support of this directive, DCMA is structuring its information technology investments to be in synchronization with the vision of the DoD guidance. One early result of this review is the decision to transfer commodity information technology administrative control to Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). 

DCMA's IT investment strategy is being driven by the Director's initiatives to: 1) Develop Mission Business Systems; 2) Leverage Commodity Buying Power Through DISA; and 3) Focus on The Last Tactical Mile.  These initiatives directly align and support the Optimization and Modernization efforts of the DoD CIO, which include: 1) Network Optimization; 2) Data Center Optimization; 3) Mission Partner Engagement; 4) Defense Travel Modernization ; 5) Enterprise Collaboration; 6) Consolidation of Cyber and IT Responsibilities; 7) Rationalize Business Systems; 8) Streamline IT Commodity Purchasing.

These initiatives will empower mobile and fixed users' the ability to utilize DoD enterprise capabilities with the same or better level of efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition, it will create an IT infrastructure that enables shared services and improve timely access to data via cloud capability in a secure and protected integrated environment.

The Major Equipment program supports DCMA's requirement to procure licenses for the new DISA cloud platform which will host DCMA's Enterprise Application store which houses all of DCMA's mission specific applications available to the DCMA workforce and Mission Partners.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2020

In FY 2020, funding in the amount of $2,432,000 supports the following Messaging &amp; Collaboration requirement:
o	Enterprise App Store: Required to procure licenses for a new Impact level 4/5 (IL4/IL5) enterprise cloud platform which will centrally host new, consolidated, rationalized &amp; modernized mission specific applications available to the DCMA workforce and Mission Partners.


Explanation of Change from FY 2019 to FY 2020: In FY2018 the new Agency Director and new Chief Information Officer directed a complete review of DCMA's IT environment in efforts to transition to DISA services in early fiscal year 2020. In order to make the transition, DCMA has reduced its Procurement Defense-Wide request and increased its O&amp;M Defense-Wide request to reimburse DISA's Defense Working Capital Fund which will be used to make these procurements and provide DCMA its required IT services. Delays in this equipment transition to DISA will prolong DCMA's reliance upon contract network support and asset capitalization.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Program Overview: 
The Defense Security Service (DSS) supports national security and the warfighter through  its industrial security oversight, education, and insider threat missions. The DSS is responsible for overseeing the protection of classified information and technologies, and materials in the hands of cleared industry by ensuring compliance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) on behalf of 26 Department of Defense (DoD) components and 32 other U.S. Federal agencies. The NISP serves as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security program to protect classified information and to preserve our Nation's economic and technological interests. The DSS provides security oversight, counterintelligence coverage and support to approximately 10,000 cleared companies (comprising over 12,800 industrial facilities and about 850,000 cleared contractors), and accreditation of more than 55,000 workstations across multiple and differing classified networks that process classified information and 160 Secure Internet Protocol Router Networks (SIPRNet) nodes.  The DSS supports the Automated Information Systems (AIS) and telecommunications infrastructure and programs that include: National Industrial Security Program (NISP), Counterintelligence (CI), Center for Development of Security Excellence (CDSE), and support elements. The DSS IT infrastructure includes: desktops, networks: (Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWCIS), Non-Secure Internet Protocol (NIPRNet), and Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Help Desk operations and call center. The DSS manage activities associated with the Enterprise Security System (ESS), which includes ongoing support and maintenance of the following legacy systems: Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), and Security Training Education and Professionalization Portal (STEPP) and the support of current mission systems: National Industrial Security System (NISS), National Industrial Security Program(NISP)Central Access Information Security System (NCAISS), and National Industrial Security Program(NISP)Contract Classification System (NCCS), and Office of the Designated Approval Authority (ODAA) Business Management System (OBMS).

Purpose and Scope: The funds requested provide resources necessary for life-cycle replacement of mission-essential IT equipment and to procure new investment items for Enterprise Security Systems applications.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY20 funding will provide modernization and life-cycle refresh of office automation and IT end-user infrastructure requirements.  The decrease from FY19 to FY20 is attributed to the one time increase for JWICS to the field IT equipment.</proc:Justification>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was transferred from OSD (PE 0602230D8Z) to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS)  (PE 0603342D8W).  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.  Effective FY2020, DIU will transfer from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z with a functional realignment across the FYDP to OUSD(R&amp;E). 

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) relies on innovation to maintain our nation's ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict.  The DIU increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter.  Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIU is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include "non-traditional" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016. 

DIUx mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) when it was established in July 2015. In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by WHS.  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the OUSD(R&amp;E), In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program. Effective FY2020, DIU will transfer from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z with a functional realignment to OUSD(R&amp;E). 

The DIU program will fund the development of novel leading-edge technologies emerging from high-tech companies that are not traditional defense contractors.  An objective of this program is to obtain innovative technological advancements developed in the commercial sector and integrated into the DoD technological ecosystem.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Secretary of Defense's strategic priorities includes improving the Departments lethality through multiple means to include the openness and willingness to evolve by adopting new ideas to ensure a better future for the Department and the Nation.  One of the tenets of this priority is to expand the Department's ability to access leading edge technological innovations through commercial partnerships.  The funding DIUx executes is critical as it incentivizes non-traditional defense sector companies to work with and invest in advancing DoD future capabilities.  

 Some of the projects undertaken include:  
- Hardened Network Defense that provides warfighters improved network security by obscuring vital services and data, thereby significantly decreasing the ability of advancing cyber threats to map, attack or exploit tactical systems.
- Command, Control, and Situational Awareness web-based software platform that supports user's ability to visualize relevant activities and operational metrics, collaboratively plan and approve defense activities, and monitor/manage subsequent.  DIUx projects signal investment targets for venture capital opportunities.  While these are small when compared to the DoD total budget, the 3rd party investment multiplier they generate are without equal.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Defense Digital Service (DDS) was launched in November 2015 and was formally chartered under DoD Directive 5105.87 in January 2017 in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) of the Department of Defense (DoD).  Since that time, OSD has presented over 100 potential projects to DDS, some of which would benefit significantly from the enhanced prototyping capabilities of DDS. With appropriate funding, DDS leverage, its private sector expertise to fully support the build of a system prototype / proof-of-concept. RDT&amp;E funding is required to support the DDS mission, which includes the ability to build software prototypes to prove out concepts for mission critical projects identified by the Department.

Ensuring that DDS has RDT&amp;E capabilities will increase DoD’s ability to leverage DDS’s unique technical expertise to determine which private sector software development best practices and/or technology work best for the Department. Furthermore, the development and testing of DDS prototypes, and the insight gained, would significantly lower development costs and delivery times through traditional DoD methods.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DDS was created to bring private sector software development best practices, talent, and technology to the Department’s hardest software and technology problems. Since its launch in November 2015, DDS has project demands from OSD that have increased exponentially; some of those requests would benefit from robust prototyping / proof-of-concept capabilities by DDS teams. The former is dependent on RDT&amp;E funding that supports the ability to acquire the most current technological solution and/or support from vendors well versed in the most advanced technological solutions.  

The requested RDT&amp;E funds will enable DDS to build prototypes and implement proof-of-concept tests for some key OSD projects. These projects will support missions in and out of theater, as well as long term goals of the department to modernize its offensive and defensive technological capabilities.  DoD interest in leveraging DDS to operate in this area to solve hard and impossible problems is persistent.  With appropriate funding, DDS can use the superior technical expertise of its staff, as well as ability to quickly deliver usable products to meet demand.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:AppChangeSummary>DDS Research and Development is one of the Secretary of Defense's top priorities with the intent of advancing and modernizing technology, especially software systems, critical to the successful implementation of a variety of department and warfighter missions.  DDS requirements are driven by challenging technical problems identified by the Secretary of Defense where technology is failing the Department of Defense mission and could impede the lethality and effectiveness of the warfighter.  These problems vary in scope and complexity, but at a minimum, when resolved, have a positive impact on the warfighter’s mission and capabilities.  The DDS involvement may be in the development of new code, product management, advising on code development processes and releases, and hacking or re-writing existing policies or processes that are antiquated or otherwise unnecessary.  The DDS engages on highly troubled projects to quickly implement fixes that ultimately reduce schedule slip, increase security, lower costs, improve user experiences, and accelerate performance.    
Some examples of current projects include: replacing the MEPCOM Integrated Resources System; reimagining the user interface and associated databases for the Defense Property System; devising a hard and software solution to counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that attack warfighters in theater; and developing a novel, modern approach to network defense.  The DDS team is comprised of digital experts with backgrounds in policy, contracts, design, and engineering who collectively use their private industry and federal government experience to identify solutions to problems and rapidly devise and implement solutions.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

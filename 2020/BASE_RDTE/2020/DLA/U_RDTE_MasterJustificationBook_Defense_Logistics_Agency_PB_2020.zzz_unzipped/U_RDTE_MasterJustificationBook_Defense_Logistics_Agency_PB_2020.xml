                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program funds the advanced technology development needed to achieve a responsive, efficient domestic industrial base that meets the warfighters' needs in an affordable and timely manner. The ManTech program works with DLA’s diverse supply chains to improve manufacturing capability throughout a product's life cycle.  It provides the crucial link between invention and application by maturing, scaling up, and validating advanced manufacturing technology in “real world” environments.  ManTech developments provide a path to low-risk technology implementation for many small businesses and defense unique suppliers as well as depots and shipyards that are critical to DLA.  By anticipating and addressing production and sustainment problems before they occur, readiness levels increase and sustainment costs are lower.  

DLA ManTech is aligned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (IIBM); 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply (MVSS); and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information (ITLI).  

• The IIBM SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA has supply chain focused execution portfolios for food (Subsistence Network), Castings (Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology), Forgings (Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology), Batteries (Battery Network) and Additive Manufacturing.

• MVSS includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements without relying on foreign sources for microcircuits.  This strategic focus area mitigates supply issues caused by the lack of a reliable domestic manufacturing capability to produce products or raw materials needed to build and maintain weapon systems.  The major focus of the program is maintaining a reliable, trusted, domestic source for “non-procurable” linear and digital microcircuits.  Microcircuit emulation allows the Services to save significant costs by using form, fit and functionally equivalent spare parts rather than redesigning the next-higher-assembly.

• The ITLI SFA includes efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA, the Military Services, DLA industry partners and DLA customers. It includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) programs.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected up and down the supply chain and across all DLA Customers and suppliers.  A major focus is to transform DoD engineering data from two-dimensional paper-based products to three-dimensional computer based models, and to develop processes to move from “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF files) to technical data files that can interface directly with industries’ engineering systems. The benefits include shorter product introduction cycles, lower set up-costs for parts production and more economical small batch production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes Strategic Focus Area (SFA) is an R&amp;D effort undertaken with DLA’s suppliers to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of production lead-times, assure DLA managed products meet performance requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable customer wait times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs. This SFA includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings/Forging programs and Additive Manufacturing programs. 

The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is the successor to the Combat Rations Network R&amp;D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program's expanded areas of interest include: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. Desired outcomes include: reduced cost, increased efficiencies, improved processes, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.

The Casting program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic casting industrial base supporting the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The casting program works with industry, universities, and the Casting Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation’s foundry industry. The program aligns projects with strategic issues and identified focus areas within the DLA and DoD. Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the casting industry. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are castings. This program includes tasks that focus on developing new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented, most often in conjunction with the casting industry associations. These advancements improve the metal casting supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter. We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DoD weapon systems.

The Forging program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic forging industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Working with industry, universities, and the Forging Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation’s forging industry. The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas identified within the DLA and DoD. Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the forging industry. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Number (NSN) Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are forgings. This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the forging industry associations. These advancements improve the forging supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DoD weapon systems.

The Battery Network (BATTNET) program objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. BATTNET conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for specific groups of batteries. BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of Service approved batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) program objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits. DLA is pursing all AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.  The AM effort pursues alternate means of supply for products that are otherwise non-procurable or susceptible to procurement issues due to an unresponsive manufacturing vendor base. The AM effort includes the identification of AM candidates among the population of products that are needed but hard to obtain, costly or have long manufacturing lead times. The AM effort requires management of 3D digital technical and manufacturing data. In addition, the AM effort includes the development of the processes that will tie the designers, engineers, maintainers, logisticians, procurement managers and the vendor base into a seamless AM procurement stream. Potential benefits include products that can address an unfulfilled Warfighter readiness need by reducing production lead times, production costs, storage costs, transportation costs and in some cases fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. DLA R&amp;D will leverage these efforts with Industry, Academia and ongoing Military Service-level agreements (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Department of Energy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Maintaining Viable Supply Sources (MVSS) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) consists of projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently. Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Material Acquisition Electronics (MAE) program. 

The Program Roadmap has two major thrusts areas: Digital Microcircuits and Linear/Analog Microcircuits.  The program has several projects addressing specific classes of obsolescent microcircuit technologies. Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern. These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY2019 and beyond. Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information (ITLI) SFA projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST), the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR), and the Emergent Manufacturing Technology (EMT) portfolios within its scope. 

The Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) program’s focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations for DoD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to define, communicate, and collaborate on military unique combat uniforms and individual equipment (CUIE) requirements. DLA has the responsibility to manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly shorten the time needed to transition Combat Uniforms and Individual Equipment from development to operational use from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military CUIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based manual environment, into a knowledge-based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end-to-end supply chain.

The DLIR program researches core technology to improve the quality, speed, and interoperability of logistics data acquisition and management to enable and streamline DLA operations.  DLA must transform business practices and methodologies as the data for weapons systems evolve from traditional formats and delivery methods (such as two-dimensional images and PDF formats) to newer, more innovative methods (such as three-dimensional solid models, object-oriented databases, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 3C standards). This fundamental shift for DLA is driven by the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) approach, which is influencing the way industry is delivering design and development data for weapon systems to the Military Services and the way the Military Services in turn manage and provide the data to DLA. DLA Logistics Operations, DLA Acquisition, DLA Tech/Quality, and the Defense Standardization Program Office (DSPO) are key stakeholders in the DLIR initiatives to modernize the representation and delivery of weapons systems data.  

The EMT program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MUST plans to continue test and validation pilots as well as process reengineering. In addition MUST plans to begin a schedule for prototype development and demonstration to be initiated in FY19.

Emerging Manufacturing Technology program enables DLA to investigate new disruptive technology advances that may be implemented in the nearer term, without degrading  well established program efforts. This program enables the Agency to advance those technologies sooner to the warfighter earlier. SBIR phase III efforts (which cannot be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging magnetic braking technologies, and addressing strategic materials shortage/risk.</r2:Text>

The tools to be implemented are: 1. Supply Request Package (SRP) Tool for Joint Service and DLA Processes; 2. TexSpec Tool for C&amp;T Product Description and Interim Change management; 3. Product Test Center (PTC) Management Tool for source testing and color shade management; 4. MUSTSize Tool for joint tariff optimization.   

The DLIR program plans to continue assisting DLA to improve the quality, speed, and interoperability of logistics data across the Enterprise and for the defense industrial base. DLIR will continue promoting and demonstrating the use of methodologies that are computer-aided design(CAD) software-neutral across the military service Engineering Support Activities (ESAs) and Program Management Offices (PMOs) that provide DLA with technical data for Class IX parts.  DLIR will also initiate the Connecting the Model-Based Enterprise project working closely with a selected PMO or ESA as it stands up its Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system to operationally test different methods and processes to obtain technical data packages for selected Class IX weapon system parts resident in the PLM system.

The EMT program enables DLA to investigate new disruptive technology advances that may be implemented in the nearer term, without degrading  well established program efforts. This program enables the Agency to advance those technologies sooner in order to provide to the warfighter earlier. Small business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase III efforts (which cannot be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging magnetic braking technologies, and addressing strategic materials shortage/risk. Efforts will begin in FY2019 to advance Digital Manufacturing by developing a comprehensive approach to take advantage of integrated, computer-based systems of simulation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, analytics and various collaboration tools to create and manufacture products to support the warfighter.  Additionally, any emergent Strategic Materials requirements will be addressed through the EMT program.</r2:Text>

Digital Data Modernization for Manufacturing (D2M2) will develop and implement efficient processes and technologies that enable combat uniform and individual equipment technical data to be seamlessly used throughout the DLA C&amp;T Supply Chain. This will be achieved by working with the Services and the DLA C&amp;T industrial base to refine the processes that are used, define item technical requirements, and effectively communicate them to the industrial base.  For example, settings for test equipment would be directly fed into the machine and results would be directly communicated to quality assurance managers.  Test results would be more accurate, traceable and timely.
   
A new broad agency announcement (BAA) will be released for an anticipated FY2020 award. The BAA will identify technical opportunities to develop and use digital data for manufacturing modernization.

The DLIR program will continue with the Connecting the Model-Based Enterprise project and initiate the Logistics Interoperability Technology Extension (LITE) project. LITE will enable improved interoperability between DoD internal and external data sources. For example, LITE proposes publishing logistics documents as data instead of PDF by utilizing advanced content interpretation techniques to extract and model the data inside the document. This approach will be based upon open standards to encourage adoption and integration between DLA and non-DLA systems.

The EMT program continues to enable DLA's investigation of new disruptive technology advances that may be implemented in the nearer term, without degrading  well established program efforts. This program enables the Agency to advance those technologies sooner in order to provide to the warfighter earlier. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase III efforts (which cannot be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging magnetic braking technologies, and addressing strategic materials shortage/risk. Efforts will continue in FY2020 to advance Digital Manufacturing by developing a comprehensive approach to take advantage of integrated, computer-based systems of simulation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, analytics and various collaboration tools to create and manufacture products to support the warfighter.  Additionally, any emergent Strategic Materials requirements will be addressed through the EMT program.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military services need to operate – including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&amp;D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Log R&amp;D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. 

The DLA Log R&amp;D program is organized into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs):
• Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (EAMD): R&amp;D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  
• Improving Logistics Processes (ILP): R&amp;D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.
• Emergent Logistics R&amp;D Requirements (ELR): R&amp;D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&amp;D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  This SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible responsiveness to emerging market and customer requirements.  This SFA consists of two programs:

The Medical Logistics Network (MLN) program supports the Medical Directorate’s mission to develop and implement the logistics and medical supply chain business practices that ensure the cost-effective and efficient distribution of medical materiel to the full range of Military Health System operations.  A portion of the MLN budget was realigned to other R&amp;D efforts due to no specific projects identified.  Assessments are currently being conducted for viable R&amp;D projects for the budgeted amounts.

The R&amp;D Strategic Distribution &amp; Disposition (SDD) Program collaborates with DLA Distribution and Disposition Services to identify capability shortfalls (gaps) that allow the opportunity to address these shortfalls through major applied research efforts and to further improve operational effectiveness and efficiency in support of Warfighter’s requirements. A key objective of the SDD Program is to infuse innovative solutions into distribution and disposition operations that address inadequate legacy capabilities and the challenges of future worldwide distribution, disposition, reutilization, and retrograde requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. 

Although all DLA processes are in scope, the strategic focus area for FY2019 has four thrusts: Procurement, Inventory Management, Planning, and Retail Operations process improvements.

Innovative process changes and new technologies will be researched in these areas to drive improvements to internal costs, reduce award delays, reduce the threat of counterfeit parts, improve demand forecasting, and increase retail operational efficiency.  Researching the use of artificial intelligence/Machine Learning blockchain technology, demand forecasting, adoption of Commercial Acquisition Innovation and Integration of maintenance and supply data in DLA processes are major research areas that will be pursued in the coming years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs. In the past DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times. Saving the lead-time allows the agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs. The Program will initiate the Advanced Thermoelectric Technology project to improve the current thermoelectric heater technology so it is more fuel-efficient, has an increased heating range, reduced maintenance requirements, and a longer service life. The Advanced Thermoelectric Heater will replace the existing Space Heater Convective standard heaters currently stocked at DLA, and will provide DoD a single, versatile heater that reduces the logistics footprint and satisfies the space heating requirements of expeditionary forces. Additionally, SCM will support DLA Strategic Materials with one or more cost saving opportunities that exist for DLA via recycling and recovery initiatives.

In FY18, the AM project will be funded under PE 0603680S / Manufacturing Technology Program (ManTech) Project 7 - Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (formerly Material Availability). This realignment will maintain continuity of funding and activity for this program.

ERP will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department finds it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce low volume state-of-the-practice (SOTP) and legacy microelectronics that are unavailable from commercial foundries. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing a guaranteed and Trusted source of supply of microelectronics parts that are essential to combat operations. In addition DMEA provides the rare technology capability to bridge the gap between research and application allowing DMEA to develop, manage and implement innovative microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. This unique research and engineering capability will be leveraged to develop low-volume, high mix fabrication processes for state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies that meet the Department’s performance and reliability needs.

This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. Trusted access to SOTA technologies remains a major challenge and therefore it is most important to develop a long term Trusted source for the Department. Threats to Defense Microelectronics include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments, and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned, extended combat use increases their attrition and increases the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities. 

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires low volume SOTP and legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. There is also the major challenge of the ability of Defense R&amp;D Programs to access Trusted SOTA technologies when developing new systems. Consequently, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. To meet these requirements, DMEA procures commercial licenses to organically produce semiconductor technologies that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and guaranteed source of these critical parts. This proven model can be extended to SOTA technologies by acquiring advanced commercial process Intellectual Property (IP) and implementing it in a copy exact approach.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication expertise to ensure that the Department can field systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA has established increased ties with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Combatant Commanders to understand their specific threats and opportunities that can be exploited by quicker, more resilient microelectronic solutions. This knowledge of varying requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions – along with its unique technical perspective – allows DMEA to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA has years of experience understanding the maturity of US and world microelectronics technology and knows what it takes to adapt the technology for the US warfighter. Based on the results of the knowledge DMEA acquires through technology forecasting, effective modeling/simulation, prototyping and experimentation, DMEA influences program requirements with recommended improvements and advancements. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool that can be leveraged by the entire US Government in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs. 

Working alongside industry, DMEA utilizes a business model that establishes a pathway that accelerates the delivery of superior semiconductor technologies. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now guaranteed to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. DMEA incorporates commercial technology, along with accelerated acquisition methods to accelerate delivery of needed capability. In this way, DMEA revolutionizes the way the Department leverages commercial technology by exploiting business-cycle opportunities to access these technologies. In this way, the government ensures perpetual access to this technology without bearing the high, upfront process development and qualification costs.

These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed IP and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production order. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence necessary to ensure them that their IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a weapon system operational, elevate its sophistication level, or to meet new threats. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. Extending this mission to include assured access to Trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies will more comprehensively ensure the integrity of microelectronics in all critical defense systems. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies with distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, guaranteed and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades to acquire IP and manufacturing capabilities of SOTA technologies, including the CMOS9LP process as well as the technical services to ensure its successful installation via the copy exact model, as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, and the incorporation of the process technologies that are necessary to anticipate the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands. 

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and are required to remain in service beyond planned replacement schedules, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, often makes DMEA the only available resource allowing many systems to remain operational.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department, other agencies, and the intelligence community require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DoDI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid altered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities available to be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies. Commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies, and is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, along with most other key defense technologies, depend heavily on high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement often translates into significant force multipliers and capability advantages. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors. 

The Trusted Foundry program provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. DMEA will foster all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry, as well as the extension and implementation of key process technologies for trust at DMEA. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, access to Trusted Microelectronics is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process. Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place. 

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems. Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents. The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions. This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous. 

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow. Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data. Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment. The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness. Currently, Defense Agencies use several different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision-making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.

The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies, field activities and non-Service organizations across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision-making. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.

The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.6 (R12). DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards. The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative sources).

DAI supports the FY 2018- FY 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS Strategic Goal 3, “Reform the Department’s Business Practices for Greater Performance and Affordability as well as Strategic Objectives 3.1 “Improve and Strengthen business operations through a move to DoD-Enterprise or shared services; reduce administrative and regulatory burden” as well as SO 3.3 Undergo an audit, and improve the quality of budgetary and financial information that is most valuable in managing the DoD.

The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report (B2R); Procure to Pay (P2P) with enhancements facilitating SFIS/SLOA and DoD procurement data standards and direct Treasury disbursing;  Acquire to Retire (A2R) (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (H2R) (Time and Labor reporting and absence management only); Order to Cash (O2C); Proposal to Reward (P2R) (Grants financial management and accounting only; and a phased implementation of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GCR) capabilities supporting audit readiness. Future Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA). 

DAI is currently implemented at 23 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)). DAI supports over 62k personnel including, 45.6 thousand users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) assertion packages.  In 2017 and in 2018, the system received an unmodified SAE 18 report with no comments. 

The benefits of DAI are:
• Labor efficiencies (entering data once) and shared across all business processes (modules), workflows and lifecycle in a modern system;
• Reduction in contractor support;
• Financial visibility (Access to real-time financial data transactions);
• Enabling agility and resilience in execution (No silos – anyone/anywhere can backfill and work continues);
• Retiring legacy systems;
• Shared common business processes and employment of Federal/DoD Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS, SLOA, Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Procurement Request Data Standard (PRDS)); and United 
  States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.
• Reducing reliance on custom Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows by leveraging application upgrades 
• Enhanced Internal controls to ensure accurate data, regulatory compliance and ensuring segregation of duties 
• Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements; and
• Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities.

The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support. 

DLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager, and PMO staff. The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing. The DAI PMO serves as systems integrator. Contracted subject matter experts configure COTS to provide compliant business processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

NR-KPP Att B - Managed in the Network 

1) Type of Networks that are connected: 
- The DAI application supports multiple Defense Agencies, and thus is accessible from multiple network points. A typical user accesses the application via the web browser from his/her agency specific LAN/WAN and/or local site firewall configurations, traversing through the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRNet) to reach the secure DAI application hosted within the DoD Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which is controlled and managed by DISA.
- The DAI production application is hosted in a DISA DECC environment located in Ogden, UT and is managed by DAI Program Management Office
2) Measures of Performance (MOPs) to measure network entrance and management performance:
a) Network related (DISA) – as per DISA Catalog of Services 
-Interactive Availability - Portion of network/system controlled by DISA CSD available to the partner during the interactive window
-Batch Throughput – Completion rate and delivery by specified time during batch window specified in SLA
b) Database related (DAI Program Management Office)
-System Availability 
-On Line user system response
3) Network Management:
-The Agency (user) being supported is responsible for the communications infrastructure necessary for leaving their location to connect users to the NIPRNet 
-DISA is responsible for communications on NIPRNet between the end user and the main DAI environment
-DAI Program Management Office is responsible for activities occurring within the application and the Oracle Database
4) Systems Management 
-NIPRNet and Infrastructure - Centralized within DISA CSD 
-DAI System – centralized within DAI Program Management Office
5) Network Configuration Parameters – N/A (within the realm of DISA management) DAI will measure the percentage of success for:
* Supports secure Internet/NIPRNET access to solution. Interactive Availability. Objective-98.5%;
* Supports secure Internet/NIPRNET access to solution. Batch Throughput. Objective-95%;

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Agency's wholesale supplies and suppliers.  It requires supply chain excellence.  Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit innovative research and development proposals from the small business community to address DLA’s strategic and operational requirements.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve some technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and provide a strong business case for Phase II investment for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration.  A favorable return on investment and commercialization potential have a strong influence on Phase II selections.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

The DLA's SBIR/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within several DLA Elements:

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>SBIR /STTR programs measure performance in two separate metrics:

1.  Phase Progression: In terms of progression from Phase I to Phase II to Phase III, DLA deems each successive progression success.  DLA seeks to have a 30% progression from one Phase to the next as a minimum.

2.  Commercialization:  The Congressional language defines “Commercialization,” which is clarified by the Office of Secretary of Defense Office of Small Business Programs (OSD/OSBP) Re-Authorization Policy Directive:
- (Investment) The process of developing products, processes, technologies, or services; and/or 
- (Sales) The production and delivery (whether by the originating party or by others) of products, processes, technologies, or services for sale to or use by the Federal Government or commercial markets    

The Small Business Administration and OSD/OSBP assign a Commercialization Index based on progression within the Phases and reported successes.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                                    <r2:Description>This program is reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119 (a)(1) in the Special Access Program Annual Report to Congress.  The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  USD(AT&amp;L) will provide acquisition oversight authority for the program.

The PDC has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in October 2011.

The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

Processes will be created for the Units to identify additional parameters that will then combine the Allowance Standards and these user parameters to generate the Units Authorized Quantity Levels.  The final process will use the DoD Standard methodology of identifying priorities to compare the On Hand Balances to the Authorized Quantities and produce Requisitioning Lists for the units to fulfill their asset requirements.

DPAS will retrieve Contract Numbers, CLINS, Quantity and Price from Electronic Document Access to create Due In/Pending transactions in DPAS to provide the Property Management Personnel oversight of assets expected for delivery.  These transactions will match to IRAPT transactions as the assets are shipped/received.

DPAS will continue to provide support for the Financial Audit.  The Department will have completed the first full audit and have findings that must be addressed.  DPAS will work with each Service or Agency to determine the areas that DPAS can increase capability to permit the findings to be closed.  At this time it is difficult to specifically state what these capabilities may be but DPAS is used by all components of the Department so there are sure to be areas that DPAS can implement capabilities to permit the Components to address the findings</r2:Text>

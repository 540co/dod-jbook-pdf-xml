            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Research Sciences consists of extramural research activities in academia and industry along with in-house investigations performed in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). This program supports fundamental broad-based scientific and engineering research in areas critical to Air Force weapon, sensor, and support systems. All research areas are subject to long-range planning and technical review by both Air Force and tri-Service scientific planning groups. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports defense-related basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines relevant to maintaining U.S. military technology superiority. Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, artificial intelligence and information fusion, smart materials and structures, quantum materials and processes for sensing, communication and computing, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competitive scholarship program. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds basic research aimed at developing fundamental scientific knowledge to support future Department of Defense Directed Energy Weapon systems through the Joint Directed Energy Transition Office.  This program funds multi-disciplinary research institutes to conduct research on laser and beam control technologies.  In addition, this program supports educational grants to stimulate student interest in directed energy and encourage graduate research in topics related to high energy lasers and high power microwaves.  These educational grants are used for educational tools, scholarships, and summer intern employees in military laboratories.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops advanced materials, processing, and inspection technologies to reduce life cycle costs and improve performance, sustainability, availability,
affordability, supportability, reliability, and survivability of current and future Air Force systems and operations. The program has three projects that develop: structural,
propulsion, and sub-systems materials and processes technologies; electronic, optical, and survivability materials and processes technologies; and sustainment
materials, processes technologies, and advanced non-destructive inspection methodologies. Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of
Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops materials technologies for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), situational awareness, and low-observable systems and subsystems for aircraft and missile applications, including sensor, microwave, and short, mid, and long-wave infrared (SWIR, MWIR, LWIR) detection and countermeasures devices used for targeting, electronic warfare, and active aircraft protection.  Materials for protection of aircrews, sensors, and aircraft from laser, and high-power microwave directed energy threats are also developed.  Electronic and optical materials are being developed to enable surveillance and situational awareness with faster operating speeds, greater tunability, higher power output, improved thermal management (including higher operating temperatures), greater sensitivity, and extended dynamic range.  New materials are being developed to counter the most prominent laser threats and to respond to emerging and agile threat wavelengths without impairing mission effectiveness. The project develops nanostructured and biological materials for aircraft structures, munitions, air vehicle subsystems, and personnel. The project develops novel materials for electromagnetic interactions with matter for electromagnetic pulse, high power microwave, and lightning strike protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops materials and processing technologies to support operational Air Force mission areas by providing the ability to inspect the quality of delivered systems, transitioning more reliable and maintainable materials, establishing a capability to detect and characterize performance threatening defects, characterizing materials processes and properties necessary for materials transition, and providing quick reaction support and failure analysis to the operational commands and repair centers.  Repair techniques and nondestructive inspection/evaluation (NDI/E) methods are developed that are needed for metallic and non-metallic structures, coatings, corrosion control processes, and to support integration of composite structures for aerospace systems.  Various NDI/E methods are essential to ensure optimum quality in the design and production of aircraft, propulsion, and missile systems.  These NDI/E methods are also essential to monitor and detect the onset of any service-initiated damage and/or deterioration due to aging of operational systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This effort investigates, develops, and analyzes aerospace vehicle technologies in the three primary areas of structures, controls, and aerodynamics for legacy and future aerospace vehicles. Advanced structures concepts are explored and developed to exploit new materials, fabrication processes, and design techniques.  Vehicle, inter-vehicle, and intra-vehicle control technologies are developed and simulated for aerospace vehicles. Advanced aerodynamic vehicle configurations are
developed and analyzed through simulations, experiments, and multi-disciplinary analyses. Resulting technologies improve performance of existing and future manned/unmanned and remotely piloted air vehicles, sustained high speed, and space access vehicles. Improvements include, but are not limited to, reduced energy use by efficient air platform designs, use of lightweight composite structures, and improved sustainment methods based on the condition of the platform and sub-systems. Projects in this effort have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program conducts applied research in the area of airmen training, airmen system interfaces, bioeffects, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior.  The Learning and Operational Readiness project conducts research to measure, accelerate, and expand the cognitive skills necessary to improve airmen training and mission performance. The Human Dynamics Evaluation project conducts research to advance machine intelligence and operator-aiding technologies by developing and
applying airman-focused research for advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and detecting and exploiting human signatures. The Sensory Evaluation and Decision Science project conducts research to revolutionize the manner in which airmen optimize the capabilities of Air Force systems, including remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and adaptive teams of airmen and machines. The Bioeffects project conducts research on the effects of human exposure to electromagnetic (EM) energy (radio frequency to optical), scalable directed energy weapons, and non-lethal weapons. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research to advance machine intelligence, information operations,  operator-aiding technologies for advanced and multi-domain integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and Airman bioscience protection technologies. Research is focused in the following areas: human analyst augmentation, human trust and interaction, human signatures, and molecular bioeffects. The human analyst augmentation area develops, integrates, and evaluates human-centric analyst technology to develop cognitive systems engineering solutions for airman data overload, work integration, and mission performance, enhancing operationally effective ISR for the Air Force. This area also includes research to enable and enhance airman-machine teaming for distributed multi-domain operations.  The human trust and interaction area seeks to advance human language technologies to benefit military linguists and analysts as well as to understand, quantify, and calibrate trust factors influencing airman interaction with autonomous systems that can be applied to airman-machine teaming in future weapon systems. The human signatures area develops and applies Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) to detect and exploit a variety of human-centered signatures, including behavioral and anthropometric aspects of existing and emerging adversaries as well as bio and molecular signatures of airman performance. The molecular bioeffects area conducts research to protect Airmen from toxic chemicals and materials to include nanomaterials and other advanced development materials and to discover novel biomarkers and molecular mechanisms to support personalized training, performance and protection of Airmen cognitive and physical performance using advanced sense, assess and augment technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research to revolutionize the manner in which airmen optimize the capabilities of Air Force systems, including remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and adaptive teams of airmen and machines.  Research optimizes airman situational awareness and cognitive performance, improves the airman-machine interface, and seamlessly integrates warfighters with their weapon systems across air, space, and cyber domains.  Research is conducted in four focus areas:  applied neuroscience; human role in semiautonomous systems; battlespace visualization; and battlespace acoustics.  The applied neuroscience area develops technologies to enhance airman-airman and airman-machine collaborations and system interactions in distributed decision-making environments.  The human role in semiautonomous systems area develops new control/display concepts and technologies to optimize Air Force platform capabilities.  The battlespace visualization area advances the science and technology (S&amp;T) associated with collecting, optimizing, displaying, and assimilating sensory information to enhance warfighter decision-making.  The battlespace acoustics area researches human-human and human-machine communications to exploit the use of voice and acoustic data in collaborative, net-centric environments while accounting for the effects of acoustic propagation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research on the effects of human exposure to electromagnetic (EM) energy (direct current (DC) to radio frequency (RF) to optical), scalable directed energy weapons, and non-lethal weapons. This research addresses fundamental physical principles, as well as the psychophysical interaction between directed energy and the individual or groups of individuals. Research is divided into two core focus areas: optical radiation bioeffects and radio frequency radiation (RFR) bioeffects. Optical radiation bioeffects research enhances combat survivability and systems effectiveness through technologies that enable deployed forces to counter optical threats and exploit optical systems for offensive applications. The RFR bioeffects research investigates basic biological mechanisms of RFR, conducts theoretical and empirical dosimetry, conducts research of bioeffects from short and long-term exposures, develops methods to counter RFR threats, and performs research for exploitation of directed energy systems for offensive capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This effort develops propulsion and power technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary aerospace technology capabilities. The effort has six projects, each focusing on a technology area critical to the Air Force. The Advanced Propulsion Technology project develops high-speed air breathing propulsion engines to include combined cycle, ramjet, and hypersonic scramjet technologies to enable revolutionary propulsion capability for the Air Force. The Combustion and Mechanical Systems project develops engine mechanical system technologies: bearings, seals, drives, and lubricants as well as combustion components, concepts, and technologies for legacy and advanced turbine engines. The Turbine Engine Technology project develops enabling capabilities to enhance performance and affordability of existing weapon systems and develops component technologies for ultra high pressure ratio, substantially improved durability, and adaptive cycle engine architecture to provide optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and life for widely varying mission needs. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops electrical power and thermal control technologies for military applications that remove operational limitations and enable advanced vehicle designs and high-power mission systems. The Rocket Propulsion Technology project develops advances in rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, missiles, the sustainment of strategic systems, and tactical rockets. The Aerospace Fuel Technology project evaluates hydrocarbon-based fuels for legacy and advanced turbine engines, scramjets, pulse detonation, and combined-cycle engines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid boost/missile propulsion, post boost control, aging and surveillance efforts), and tactical missiles. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Develop technologies to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD). Technologies under this project enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Tasks include: modeling and simulation; proof of concept tests of critical components; advanced component development; and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance tasks could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause. All thrusts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) collaboration and are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and progress towards RP21 Goals.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops the technology base for Air Force aerospace sensors and electronic combat. Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities. To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in: 1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) radio frequency antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive electro-optical/infrared sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; 5) technology for affordable, trusted, and reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike radio frequency sensors and electronic combat systems; and 6) technologies that aid in the discovery and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities in avionics systems. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

Project 624920, Electronic Warfare, is new for FY 2020. Starting FY 2020, some Electronic Warfare activities will be transferred from PE 0602204F, Aerospace Sensors, Project 627622, RF Sensors and Countermeasures Tech, and PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities, and Project 63691X, EO/IR Warning &amp; Countermeasures Tech, in order to rebalance the mix of Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development. This is an administrative realignment only and not a new start.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and assesses affordable, reliable all weather radio frequency sensing and countermeasure concepts for aerospace applications covering the range of radio frequency sensors including communications, navigation, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and radar, both active and passive, across the air, land, sea, space and cyber domains.  This project also develops and evaluates technology for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with radio frequency signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple radio frequency phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques. This project also develops concepts to counter threats to our aerospace systems. It develops and evaluates technology for electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and electro-optical/infrared seeker defeat. This project develops the radio frequency warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. The project also explores technologies to maintain a military advantage in positioning, navigation and timing integrity, accuracy, and resiliency.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Implementation of 10 U.S.C. Section 2363, amendment to PL 110-417, 10 U.S.C. Section 2358 and 10 U.S.C. 2805(d)(1)(B), to fund:  innovative basic and applied research conducted at the defense laboratory and supports military missions; development programs supporting the transition of technologies developed by the defense laboratory into operational use; workforce development activities improving the capacity of the defense laboratory to recruit and retain personnel with necessary scientific and engineering expertise that support military missions; and the repair or minor military construction of the laboratory infrastructure and equipment.

The Air Force is dependent on technological advances in response to emerging threats and to maintain a competitive advantage.  Air Force has a comprehensive and deliberative planning process to identify and fund research that is expected to have the greatest benefit to the Air Force and the warfighter.  10 U.S.C. Section 2363 provides the Commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in consultation with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive, a degree of flexibility to rapidly exploit scientific breakthroughs or respond to emerging threats, to include developing a skilled workforce and necessary infrastructure.  This flexibility increases the rate of innovation and accelerates the development and fielding of needed military capabilities to address current and future problems.  

The Air Force has established PE 0602212F, where the 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 funds are internally reprogrammed to this program element in the year of execution after receipt of the appropriation. This allows increased transparency to Congress on 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 funding and additional execution flexibility for 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 activities to cross all technology areas.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is a global technical enterprise, boasting some of the best and brightest leaders in the world. It provides revolutionary, relevant, and responsive science and technology (S&amp;T) to the Warfighter. AFRL's mission is to lead the discovery, development, and integration of affordable warfighting technologies for the global air, space, and cyberspace force.

In FY 2018, PE 0602298F, Science and Technology Management - Major Headquarters Activities, Project 622520, Science and Technology Management - Major HQ, was established to provide increased transparency to Congress on personnel in Major Headquarters Activities (MHA). A portion of HQ AFRL civilian manpower was transferred into this PE from the following Air Force S&amp;T RDT&amp;E PEs: 0601102F, Basic Research; 0602102F, Materials; 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies;
0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion; 0602204F, Aerospace Sensors; 0602601F, Space Technology; 0602602F, Conventional Munitions; 0602605F, Directed Energy Technology; and 0602788F, Dominant Information Sciences and Methods. This was an administrative realignment and not a new start. Prior year funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in the Air Force S&amp;T RDT&amp;E PEs listed above.

This program element includes necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, and 1206601F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program focuses on four major areas. First, the space survivability and surveillance area develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Air Force systems. Second, the spacecraft payload technologies area improves satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities. Third, the spacecraft protection area develops technologies for protecting United States space assets in potential hostile settings. The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and control technologies, and their interactions. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

In FY 2019, the entirety of PE 0602601F, Space Technology, transfers to PE 1206601F, Space Technology, to provide increased transparency to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Congress regarding Space Science and Technology Major Force Program 12 Space investment.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program investigates, develops, and establishes the technical feasibility and military utility of guidance and ordnance technologies for conventional air-launched munitions.  The effort supports core technical competencies of fuze technology; energetic materials; damage mechanisms; munitions aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, and control; terminal seeker sciences; and munition systems effects.  Technologies to be developed include blast, fragmentation, penetrating and low-collateral damage war-heads, hard-target fuzing, precise terminal guidance, and high-performance and insensitive explosives.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program covers research in Directed Energy (DE) technologies, primarily High Energy Lasers (HEL); including devices; optical beam control; integration; target lethality/vulnerability assessments; ground-based optical Space Situational Awareness (SSA); and high power microwaves (HPM). Laser research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications, optical technologies to propagate laser beams through the atmosphere, and integration of these technologies into demonstration packages.  Space Situational Awareness research uses the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) and the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) to develop and implement technologies to identify visual characteristics such as status and health of orbiting space objects.  In high power microwaves (HPM), this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons. This program conducts research into other novel Directed Energy applications; conducts Directed Energy vulnerability/lethality assessments; develops protection technologies versus Directed Energy; conducts research into other advanced non-conventional/innovative weapons; develops and uses tools to compare solutions to determine the most effective and efficient Directed Energy technologies to meet Air Force needs; coordinates efforts through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops enterprise-centric information technology for the Air Force. Advances in enterprise-centric information technologies are required to increase warfighter readiness and effectiveness by providing the right information, at the right time, in the right format, anytime, anywhere in the world. The Connectivity and Protection Tech project provides the technologies for multi-level, secure, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept techniques, as well as technologies that deter any adversary from attacking computer systems while allowing access to, presence on, manipulation of, and operational effects on adversary computer systems. This project also develops the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide-bandwidth, multi-channeled, air- and space-based communications networks. The Information Management and Computational Tech project provides advances in information management and dissemination technologies to ensure the delivery of high-quality, timely, secure information to the warfighter, and develop technologies to produce both advanced on demand computational processing and computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Air Force systems. The Information Decision Making Tech project develops the technology to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations. The Operational Awareness Tech project develops technologies that improve their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information. The Research Site Support project provides the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, New York and provides for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. 

In FY 2020, Project 625315 renamed from Connectivity and Protection Tech to C4I Dominance Technology.

In FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech efforts will be transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.

In FY 2020, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech efforts will be transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.

In FY 2020, Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts will be transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0622041F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires advanced technologies which support the Air Force five core missions and enable the Air Force to achieve Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power in support of national security objectives. The technologies developed under this project enable the National Defense Strategy and Air Force future operating concepts which require operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate—and shift among—multiple solutions for a given challenge), creating combinations of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities to achieve desired effects in the battlespace.

This project provides the technologies for secure, self-configuring, self-healing, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept communications techniques; agile and dynamic policy-based network management capabilities; and modular, programmable, low-cost software radios. In addition, it develops both the technology base for ultra-wide bandwidth and multi-channeled communications networks (both air and space based) on and between platforms.

This project provides the technologies which enable the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.

This project advances technologies enabling the effective execution of military objectives that will vastly improve the ability to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict. This project provides technologies for anticipatory decision support; course of action development, planning, scheduling, and assessment; and the real-time effective portrayal of complex data sets.

This project improves and automates the capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information.  This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.

In FY 2020, Project 625315 renamed from Connectivity and Protection Tech to C4I Dominance Technology.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of its information and information assets in achieving its mission objectives as the importance of information grows in the current net-centric environment.  Technology development in this project must be capable of taking advantage of future net-centric environments including new structured and ad hoc processes in response to rapidly changing warfare challenges.  Advances in robust information management focus on quality of service and flow of information within the enterprise, information transformation and brokering, secure information sharing across and among domains, and collaboration of workflow within the enterprise.  Technologies addressed in this project include the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of  information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.

The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of information and information assets in support of multi-domain command and control.

In FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech efforts will be transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires advances in technologies enabling the effective execution of military objectives that will vastly improve the ability to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict.  Technology development in this project includes anticipatory decision support; course of action development, planning, scheduling, and assessment; and the real-time effective portrayal of complex data sets.

The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of information and information assets in support of multi-domain command and control.

In FY 2020, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech efforts will be transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that improve and automate the capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information.  This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.  It leads the research, discovery, and development of technology that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence sources to provide accurate object tracking and identification, situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace (air, ground, space, and cyber).  It also leads in the development of advanced exploitation technologies to maximize the intelligence gained from our adversaries in the areas of spectral detection and geolocation, signal recognition and analysis, and the data tagging, tracking, and tracing via the insertion of secure, imperceptible signal embedding for future fusion and understanding of the information.

The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, the Air Force requires dynamic and elastic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance forces and capabilities to provide actionable intelligence to commanders and to increase understanding of the environment and an adversary's capabilities and intentions.

In FY 2020, Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts will be transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies to deliver a full range of options in cyberspace on par with air and space dominance in each of the areas of cyber-attack, cyber defense, and cyber support to achieve the strategic capability of cyber dominance. The Air Force requires the development of superior, intelligent, on-demand computing to enable information superiority to include advances in secure information sharing across domains and boundaries as well as technologies that successfully deter any adversary from attacking computer systems anytime, anywhere by ensuring the Air Force's ability to: access, maintain presence on, and deliver effects to adversary systems; detect, defend, and respond to attacks on friendly computer systems and provide forensic analysis concerning those attack attempts; and provide cyber situational awareness to Air Force Commanders. In addition, the Air Force requires technology development that produces computing architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing constrained, dynamic mission objectives; "game-changing” computing power to the warfighter, disruptive computing power at the tactical edge and for federated grid services; and interactive and real-time computing improving the usability of high-performance computing to the Air Force. It includes technologies in computational sciences and engineering, computer architectures and software intensive systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate leads the discovery, development and implementation of information science and technology to drive transformation within the Air Force and across the Department of Defense. The focus of the work is to provide the warfighter with the required technology-based capabilities to defend the Nation by unleashing the power of innovative information science and technology to anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess anything, anytime, anywhere. Since the site is a single-purpose location which is not located on a military installation, the Information Directorate has unique requirements for supporting its science and technology mission.  As the host unit, the directorate is responsible to provide the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, New York and provide for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission.  Operations include: logistics and communication services, utilities, maintenance of facilities and structures, safety and security of the workforce and visiting researchers, and ensures compliance with the laws, regulations, and directives that pertain to site operations.  These services are host unit responsibilities and are necessary to provide a safe and effective environment for the Research Site's workforce and mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds Department of Defense Directed Energy applied research through the Joint Directed Energy Transition Office. This program is part of an overall Department of Defense Directed Energy Science and Technology program. Directed Energy weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements. Directed Energy Weapon Systems have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including high value asset and base protection, precision strike and platform self-protection versus a wide variety of missile, rocket, artillery, mortar and air platforms. Efforts under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple Directed Energy Weapon systems and multiple Service missions while complementing Service/Agency efforts that are directed at specific Service needs. A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as laser sources, microwave sources, laser beam control, antennas, waveguides, modeling and simulation, and lethality mechanisms. This program supports the Senior Official as required. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.


This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program focuses on four major areas. First, the space survivability and surveillance area develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Air Force systems. Second, the spacecraft payload technologies area improves satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities. Third, the spacecraft protection area develops technologies for protecting United States space assets in potential hostile settings. The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and  control technologies, and their interactions. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

In FY 2019, the entirety of PE 0602601F, Space Technology, transfers to PE 1206601F, Space Technology, to provide increased transparency to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Congress regarding Space Science and Technology Major Force Program 12 Space investment. This is an administrative only adjustment and not a new start.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602298F, 0602602F, 0602605F, and 0602788F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Advanced materials technologies are also developed and demonstrated to enhance protection for Air Force sensors and systems to ensure safety, survivability, and operability in threat environments.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates mature Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) sustainment technologies such as: materials, corrosion, maintenance/repair techniques, state awareness/non-destructive inspection, health management, life prediction, low observable materials and processes, composite materials and logistics for transition into fielded Air Force systems to reduce life cycle sustainment costs and increase readiness. Technologies matured and demonstrated impact affordability and availability of fielded aerospace weapon systems by reducing sustainment costs, extending service life, and maintaining  mission readiness and capability. This program develops and demonstrates maintenance, life cycle management, and system/fleet decision making technologies that can be implemented to address operational sustainment issues and could influence future system sustainability decisions via risk reduction to support inclusion into new systems. Studies are conducted to analyze processes and methodologies for application of technologies to address sustainment issues across the force, identifying cross cutting applications for fielded systems, and opportunities for building in sustainability into future applications. This program also develops and demonstrates affordable advanced composites for aircraft structures of fielded and emerging systems.  This includes studies, analysis, and tests for application of composites to address sustainment and affordability issues across the force. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for electro-optical sensors, radar sensors and electronic counter-countermeasures, and components and algorithms. It also develops and demonstrates radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means. This program develops the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project area develops and demonstrates aerospace sensor and processing technologies for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, target, and attack radar applications in both manned and unmanned platforms, including electro-optical sensors and electronic counter-countermeasures for radars.  It provides aerospace platforms with the capability to precisely detect, track, and target both airborne (conventional and low radar cross-section) and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets in adverse clutter and jamming environments.  Project activities include developing multi-function radio-frequency systems including radar and electronic warfare technology and the position and timing information to enable distributed sensing.  Desired warfighting capabilities include the ability to detect concealed targets in difficult background conditions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports Department of Defense (DoD) priorities for demonstrations in hypersonics and manned/unmanned systems, respectively. This effort integrates and demonstrates advanced flight vehicle technologies that improve the performance and supportability of existing and future aerospace vehicles. System level integration brings together aerospace vehicle technologies along with avionics, propulsion, and weapon systems for demonstration in a near-realistic operational environment.  Integration and technology demonstrations reduce the risk and time required to transition technologies into operational aircraft. Projects in this program have been coordinated through the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary advances in turbine, advanced-cycle, rocket, and space propulsion as well as electrical power, thermal management, and fuels.  The program has six projects, each focusing on technologies with a high potential to enhance the performance of existing and future Air Force weapon systems.  The Aerospace Fuels project develops and demonstrates improved hydrocarbon fuels and advanced propulsion systems, including those for air-breathing, high-speed/hypersonic flight.  The Aerospace Power Technology project develops and demonstrates adaptive power and thermal management components, controls, and systems for high-power payloads and aircraft as part of energy-optimized aircraft development.  The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project develops demonstrator engines by integrating the engine cores demonstrated in the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with low-pressure components.   The Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion project develops and demonstrates innovative rocket propulsion technologies, propellants, and manufacturing techniques.  The Advanced Aerospace Propulsion project develops the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for in-flight demonstration and for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket based).  The Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project develops and demonstrates core turbine engine technologies for current and future aircraft propulsion systems.

Portions of the Aerospace Fuels, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration, and Advanced Turbine Gas Generator  projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.

Projects in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD)  Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high- pressure spool) technology developed under the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, high power extraction, integrated thermal management, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates advanced and innovative low-cost rocket turbo-machinery and components, and low-cost space launch propulsion technologies.  Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid rocket motor boosters and missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets. Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized. Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals. Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances in this project could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately twenty to fifty percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately thirty percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems. Aging and surveillance thrusts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by fifty percent, enabling motor replacement for cause. The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The efforts in this project are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program. The efforts in this project are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee annually for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of technical goals defined by the RP21 program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates, via ground and flight tests, the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket-based) to provide the Air Force with transformational military capabilities. The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include: scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers; active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition); robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions; and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The objective is to provide continuous evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aircraft Propulsion Subsystem Integration Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to support Air Force electronic combat warfighting capabilities. The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace combat, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications. It develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole. It integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding. It develops and demonstrates technologies for navigation and timing in radio frequency (RF)
contested and denied environments. It develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for radio frequency electronic combat suites and advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms. It also develops and demonstrates technologies that identify and mitigate avionics system cyber vulnerabilities as well as protects avionics and other critical technologies. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops, integrates, and demonstrates space technologies in the areas of spacecraft payloads, spacecraft protection, spacecraft vehicles, and space systems survivability. The integrated space technologies are demonstrated by component or system level tests on the ground or in flight. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the development, demonstration, and evaluation of radiation-hardened space electronic hardware, satellite control hardware, and software for advanced satellite surveillance operations. Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized. In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (for example, radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems. For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense satellites. In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds ground-based optical space situational awareness (SSA) technology development and demonstration at the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) in Hawaii, as well as the operation and upgrade of the facility. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DOD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates technologies to enhance Airman performance and effectiveness in the aerospace force. State-of-the-science advances are made in warfighter training, warfighter system interfaces, directed energy bioeffects, deployment and sustainment of warfighters in extreme environments, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior. The Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to predict,evaluate, and mitigate the effects of directed energy on personnel and mission performance, and exploits the offensive capabilities of directed energy systems. The Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration project develops, demonstrates, and transitions human-centric technologies to address processing, exploitation, and dissemination of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability needs. The Mission Effective Performance project develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced training, simulation, mission rehearsal, and other performance-aiding methods and technologies to enhance warfighter readiness. The Warfighter Interfaces project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to revolutionize the way airmen synergistically use Air Force systems, including autonomous machines and adaptive teams of airmen and machines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops, integrates, and demonstrates advance ordnance and guidance technologies for air-launched conventional weapons.  The effort focuses on conventional ordnance component technologies such as war-heads, fuzes, and explosives, as well as munition guidance component technologies such as navigation and control systems and seekers.  Technologies to be developed, demonstrated, and integrated into system concepts will address blast, fragmentation, penetration, low collateral damage, variable depth/location fuzing, precise guidance, and high-performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program provides for the development, integration, demonstration, and detailed assessment of directed energy (DE) weapon technologies for potential application on Air Force platforms. These include high energy laser (HEL), high power microwaves (HPM),  and other unconventional weapon generation and transmission technologies, which can support a wide range of Air Force applications. The program develops a corresponding susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality database for directed energy weapons. This program also develops laser-enabled atmospheric-compensated optical imaging for space situational awareness (SSA). Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program executes technical programs to maintain and develop an affordable and reliable industrial base and manufacturing capability that will be responsive to warfighter needs.  The program develops and improves manufacturing technologies and processes to enable cost reduction, improve component and system quality, and enhance industrial capability.  Value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment.  Manufacturing Technologies objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates Air Force enterprise-centric information technologies for the warfighter. The Anticipatory Operations Intent and Response project develops the technologies for dynamic planning and execution with the accuracy, fidelity, and timeliness needed to dominate the battlespace. The Assured Worldwide Connectivity project provides advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information exchange of near-real-time multimedia (i.e., voice, data, video, and imagery) information. In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air and space-based information exchange on and between platforms. These optical networks will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs) and air and space- based platforms either en route or in theater. This project also provides tools and applications leading to the development and integration of cyber deterrence technologies resulting in a strategic capability of cyber dominance within the secure information grid. The Global Battlespace Awareness project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and total battlespace awareness by using and exploiting information from all sources. The Knowledge Management and Computing project develops the technology applications that will provide for a secure, tailored, seamless exchange of information among producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to a particular community of interest (COI). The project also provides the development of interactive and real-time computing technologies that greatly improve the usability of high-performance computing for the exchange, utilization, and management of information in the enterprise. The Cyber Battlespace Development and Demonstration project develops the ability to deliver sovereign options in cyberspace through the development and integration of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies for a strategic capability of cyber dominance.

The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. Operational agility will require flexibility (manifested as multi-domain operations), speed (manifested as superior decision speed), coordination (manifested as dynamic command and control), balance (manifested as presenting a balanced capability mix), and strength (manifested as performance-optimized teams). In order to enable operational agility, this program will begin to shape future research and development (R&amp;D) to focus on technologies in support of operational agility through multi-domain command and control (MDC2) capabilities.

This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.

In FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign planning and decision support advanced technology development.

In FY 2020, Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign intelligent networking transport and management advanced technology development.

In FY 2020, Project 635322, Knowledge Management and Computing efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4/Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign information management advanced technology development.

In FY 2020, Project 635321 C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo changed from Global Battlespace Awareness.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science &amp; technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to achieve information dominance, the Air Force must be able to monitor, assess, plan, and execute missions rapidly across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict (pre-conflict, conflict through stability operations). This project develops and integrates decision support technologies that will enhance the commander's ability to anticipate and dominate the future battlespace by more effectively forecasting the evolution of the battlespace and by more rapidly generating options to "virtually checkmate" the adversary. It develops the decision aid technologies and processes to plan the use of various assets and assess their effects in the battlespace. It provides a tailorable information environment to effectively portray complex data sets accurately in real-time.

The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.

In FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo in order to realign technology areas that better support both the Air Force Future Operating Concept and National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires advanced, net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global kinetic and non-kinetic military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information delivery and exchange of near-real-time information including voice, data, video, and imagery.  This secure environment will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between the Air Operations Center and aircraft, either en route or in theater.  This project provides secure information transmission capabilities for a persistent, global, survivable communications backbone network accessible for warfighters operating in all domains. It provides self-healing, self-configuration, anti-jam communication networking capabilities, and provides enterprise networking capabilities for agile, policy-based network management.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates flight ready systems consisting of high capacity radio frequency (RF) and optical components and architectures for next generation communications.

The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, the Air Force requires world-wide connectivity that is resilient and self-healing in the face of enemy attacks on communication and information assurance, able to withstand breaks in connectivity while still allowing users to collaborate with other connected operators to maintain localized situational awareness. The network balances the respective strengths of both forward-deployed forces and rear-based nodes.

In FY 2020, Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo in order to realign technology areas that better support both the Air Force Future Operating Concept and National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.

In order to achieve operational agility, the Air Force must be able (a) to monitor, assess, plan, and execute missions rapidly across the full spectrum of operations at all levels of war and during all phases of conflict; (b) to field advanced, secure, net-enabled architectures and communications/network technologies in support of persistent, global, and survivable kinetic and non-kinetic military operations; (c) to process and exploit data and information from a variety of sources and domains to create a common operating picture of the battlespace; and (d) to provide the decision maker and staff with seamless access to tailored information within a mobile, dynamic, and scalable, globally distributed Air Operations Center, as well as among other producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to other particular Communities of Interest (COI).

In FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.

In FY 2020, Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.

In FY 2020, Project 635322, Knowledge Management and Computing efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.

In FY 2020, Project 635321 renamed from Global Battlespace Awareness to C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that will provide the decision maker and staff with seamless access to tailored information within a mobile, dynamic, and scalable, globally distributed Air Operations Center, as well as among other producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to other particular Communities of Interest (COI).  This project demonstrates the enterprise management capabilities needed for the rapid distribution of actionable information, as well as the needed advances in high performance computing to ensure this complex capability.  This project develops an agile information environment that focuses on quality of service, transformation and brokering, a federated information environment focusing the relationship among the members of the environment, a secure cross-domain information sharing capability that focuses on the security layer and inter-COI information exchange in different security domains, and a collaboration environment focusing on the information workflow layer of the enterprise.

The National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.

In FY 2020, Project 635322, Knowledge Management and Computing efforts will be transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project develops the ability to deliver cyber-attack capabilities (access, stealth, persistence, intelligence, and weapons delivery), cyber defense capabilities (attack detection, attack attribution, and response automation) and cyber support capabilities (situation awareness and war gaming).  This project will also develop 1) a science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation, 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed and embedded computing systems, and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, and complex software-intensive systems.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act (CSEA) of 2004 created the Spectrum Relocation Fund (CSEA, Title II of P.L. 108-494) to provide a centralized and streamlined funding mechanism through which Federal agencies can recover the costs associated with relocating their radio communications systems from certain spectrum bands, which were authorized to be auctioned for commercial purposes. 

The Department of Defense (DoD) Spectrum Access Research and Development Program (SAR&amp;DP) encompasses spectrum technology development that enables Department of Defense spectrum-dependent systems to satisfy operational readiness and capability needs. Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is necessary, but not sufficient, for pursued technology solutions. The Department of Defense transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are effective (for example, survivable, electronically protected, et cetera) while operating in both the United States and congested/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed.

This program represents the Air Force investment within the SAR&amp;DP. Budget for the Air Force portion of the DoD SAR&amp;DP is created from the auction of Advanced Wireless Service licenses in execution year.

Funding supports Spectrum relocation and sharing activities.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this project is development of necessary simulation facilities and approaches to allow determination of the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare (EW) in real world engagement situations and to support the introduction of modern, effective systems into Naval Aviation. The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. 

The Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E).

This project directly supports the T&amp;E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, Low Band Transmitter, Next Generation Jammer, Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and Triton.

This project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&amp;E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Effectiveness of Naval Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (ENEWS) Project is the development and application of necessary simulation assets to determine the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare for Navy ships in simulated real-world engagement situations.  The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Force, Special Operations, and other Electronic Warfare Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for Electronic Warfare system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past ENEWS quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support Testing and Evaluation.  Simulation Display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) Testing and Evaluation and training ranges to provide visualization of Testing and Evaluation and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The Effectiveness of ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within the Department of Defense dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard Electronic Warfare systems and tactics against these type threats.  The Effectiveness of ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the Effectiveness of ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  Development Test, Operational Test and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation support includes AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship InfraRed signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and Patrol Craft class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including Test and Evaluation of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' Electronic Warfare systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint Electronic Warfare exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Aerial Target Systems Development program is the design and development of threat representative subsonic and supersonic aerial targets that simulate threat weapon systems, threat aircraft or threat Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets and auxiliary payloads are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment.  As to specific hardware development, this project includes:

 - Supersonic Targets: Portfolio includes GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST), GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST), AQM-37, and Fleet Supersonic Training Target programs. Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats. The design and development of GQM-163A capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and to a lesser degree, support fleet training. Critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events are supported for AEGIS, DDG-1000, LHA-6, CVN-78, LCS, and LSD-41/49 (SM-6, SM-2, RAM, SSDS, and ESSM). The GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 13.0 to 66 ft. The GQM-163A has also demonstrated  higher altitude diving threat profiles. MSST was a supersonic development effort that was terminated on September 25, 2015. Once the contract termination costs have been determined by DCMA, funds may be required to cover settlement costs. However, the requirement still exists to provide a multi-stage vehicle presentation. New supersonic target development efforts include the Fleet Supersonic Training Target and a replacement target for AQM-37.

 - Subsonic Targets: Portfolio includes BQM-177A, and BQM-34 &amp; BQM-74 subsonic target programs. The BQM-177A SSAT development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-74E targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities.  The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational test &amp; evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events.  Specifically, the BQM-177A SSAT provides critical live-fire test and evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.  BQM-74s are undergoing product improvement program efforts to increase their current performance envelope to meet evolving Fleet requirements and increase operational readiness needs and other subsonic targets, such as the BQM-34, are being considered for similar efforts.   

 - Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), and Target Control and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TC/TA/AS) development: the TTSP portfolio provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial targets to provide threat representative radio frequency signatures, specifically the electronic attack and threat radar emissions (active emitters). Development of threat representative simulation components is on-going and required to keep pace with evolving threats and ensure that the Navy's threat simulation capabilities maintain warfighter readiness in the current environment. TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various TMSS projects including but not limited to: Target RF datalink hardware, ground control hardware and software, scorer transponders, scoring ground stations, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification, friend or foe transponders, and associated test sets. TA/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide for high fidelity simulation of foreign threats. TA/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics. TA/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems. 

In addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development.  For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control (TC) and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Provides funding for the development of Target Control (TC) systems and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) capable of supporting Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and fleet training activities to ensure emerging threat simulation requirements are met.  Target Control Systems (TCS) involve the improved command and control systems capable of controlling multiple targets simultaneously while delivering adequate fidelity of T&amp;E telemetry data.  The TMSS program portfolio provides target control, scoring, location, and navigation of air, land and seaborne targets for fleet training and weapons systems test and evaluation.  Funding also supports the design, development and qualification of TMSS including but not limited to the current and next generation TC systems, scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification friend or foe and associated test sets.  Augmentation and auxiliary systems must be capable of augmenting targets in support of radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement/test, radar cross section evaluation, decoy effectiveness, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare, warhead effectiveness and evaluation of fleet tactics, readiness, and training. The Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP) provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial/surface targets to provide threat representative Radio Frequency signatures, specifically the Electronic Attack and Threat Radar Emissions (Active Emitters).  The TTSP accomplishes this by providing a collection of modules which are integrated into individual targets in various configurations to provide the ability to simulate the RF environment.  TTSP equipment in various configurations is certified for carriage in aerial/surface targets. Funding supports the continued development of the TTSP portfolio so that the Navy can keep pace with emerging enemy threats.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Supersonics: The GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) is an Acquisition Category II program. The acquisition  strategy includes the continued development of Quad Launch, design efforts for integration of new Radome and Radar Altimeter, Electronic Warfare (EW) systems and other Engineering Change Proposals as required to emulate emerging threat systems. These development efforts will continue to be rolled into the production baseline. Production efforts are expected to continue at higher quantities in order to meet projected MDAP T&amp;E requirements. Additionally, development of alternative supersonic targets is being explored. 

Congress was notified on September 25, 2015 that the Department of the Navy made the decision to terminate the Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) development program. Termination settlement efforts are ongoing with DCMA.

Subsonics: The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) program is an ACAT-IV program. The EMD contract is ongoing and a follow-on Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 3 contract will be awarded in 3rd Quarter of FY19 with Full Rate Production (FRP) Contracts to follow. Engineering Change Proposals will be contracted as required via IDIQ contract vehicles to keep pace with emerging threat systems and changes rolled into the production baseline. Development efforts for other subsonic targets will be resourced via other contracting efforts as required.

Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control, and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems: The acquisition strategy for these components vary, depending on industry responses to government issued Requests for Information, but most are acquired via Firm Fixed Price IDIQ contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

These systems are used exclusively for test and evaluation of naval weapons systems, which closely represent current and projected threats to fleet units in the joint strike and the littoral warfare environments. These threat representations must include characteristics in relation to size, performance envelope, and electromagnetic and infrared signatures. As threats evolve, changes must be made to keep the targets threat representative in response to increased complexity  in the test requirements from the developers of naval weapons systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort supports the transition of the Sprint Speed and Low Frequency Improvement Phase 2.5 efforts into MK 39 Mod 3 EMATT production and starts to investigate Continuous Active Sonar (CAS) capability to provide better detection performance and provide operators with a continuous track. Sprint Speed and Frequency Expansion upgrade allows EMATT to more closely represent submarine tactics for evasion and will make it compatible with new ASW sensors like the LCS ASW mission package.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the Operational Level of War (OLW) by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW). MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval warfighting requirements.  This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic decision support tool to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. This effort captures and maps issues/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE provides funding to support continuing need for studies and analysis of issues critical to decisions required by the Chief of Naval Personnel and his staff regarding manpower, personnel, training and education policies, and programs that have far-reaching implications to service members and the Navy budget.  This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower &amp; Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Naval aviation pre-Milestone B developmental activities to include the conduct and integration of systems engineering activities. This project unit provides information, automated tools, and decision aids necessary to perform acquisition planning in support of warfighter capability requirements. This project unit also supports research, development, and analysis efforts to include various studies, joint requirements analysis, and cost analysis requirements in support of systems engineering activities, analyses of alternatives, and development of the 30-Year Aviation Plan, a Congressionally mandated product. Due to high turnover and end of service life of several Naval aircraft set against increasing threat capabilities, DOD 5000 series mandates documentation of capability requirements and mechanisms to obtain these capabilities. This project unit allows Naval aviation the means to properly identify capability gaps and potential solutions required to maintain maximum warfighting capability realizing (or achieving) reductions to technical risks and overall program costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) is the Department of the Navy's (DoN) only Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

- Continued support current operations to include: weapons and systems programs, MAGTF training and exercise assessments, amphibious shipping capabilities, and reductions to naval operations and strategic commitments.  Analysis and solutions relating to support and sustainment in terms of equipment readiness, training, responsiveness and maintaining squadron readiness, development of facilities sustainment and service life programs save the Marine Corps valuable time and resources.  Manpower, force structure, aviation recruiting and retention, and valuations of recruiting, retaining and retiring Marines analyses provide viable personnel solutions in times of shrinking resources.  Intelligence capabilities assessments, analyses of threat assessments from known and unknown enemies, i.e. Al-Qaeda, Northern Africa and Iran, and Joint Irregular Warfare Analytic Baseline (JIWAB) development provide valuable information to assist Marine Corps Intelligence organizations in keeping the force educated and safe.
- Continued high priority study and analysis projects approved in FY 2017 Marine Corps Studies System Master Plan (MCSSMP).
- Continued research analysis, and survey support efforts associated with development and implantation of the Marine Forces Integration Plan (MCFIP) Women in Infantry.
- Continued high priority study and analysis projects approved in FY 2017 Marine Corps Studies System Master Plan (MCSSMP).

The Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&amp;I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  

Other evaluation processes are as follows: 
A) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.

B) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&amp;I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                        <r2:Text>CNA conducts individual analytic efforts for a wide range of DoN and DoD sponsors including: OPNAV and HQMC, the Navy Secretariat, Type Commanders, the numbered Fleets and Navy/Marine Corps component commanders, Combatant Commands, operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) activities including OPTEVFOR and DOT&amp;E, SYSCOMs, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense agencies and the Defense Intelligence Community.

In FY 2020 CNA will provide study and analysis support on critical Navy corporate priorities.  This analysis will review strategic efforts, including engagement with peer competitors and disruptive actions globally.  In addition, CNA will help Navy address internal processes from logistics to personnel policies.  As the only Navy funded FFRDC, CNA will be integral in the development of future initiatives; including big data and machine learning. CNA will also continue to provide analytical support to selected wargames and exercises; providing detailed analysis of each event to identify areas of improvement for Navy Operational procedures.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>CNA is reviewed throughout the research year on several different levels to ensure that research produced is not duplicated elsewhere. The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. 
Other evaluation processes: 

A) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. 

B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO/N8 for final review and acceptance. 

C) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&amp;L).

D) Navy-CNA Integration Board.  DON 3-stars and CNA leadership meet quarterly to review the annual research program, discuss priorities and related implications for current and future work, and address issues impacting CNA's ability to execute its mission as an FFRDC.  CNA research highlights are also briefed and discussed.  The board meetings are chaired by the Director, Navy Staff.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is
to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR
describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is
to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

Phase I Feasibility: Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3.2% for SBIR in FY 2018. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in
federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.
Phase I Feasibility: Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR
describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is
to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $1,000,000,000 to set aside 0.45% for STTR in FY 2018. This funds cooperative R&amp;D between small businesses and research institutions. The program goals are to create vehicles
from moving ideas from research institutions to market; enable researchers to pursue commercial application of technologies; and bridge funding gap between basic research and commercial product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $1,000,000,000 to set aside 0.45% for STTR in FY 2018. This funds cooperative R&amp;D between small businesses and research institutions. The program goals are to create vehicles
from moving ideas from research institutions to market; enable researchers to pursue commercial application of technologies; and bridge funding gap between basic research and commercial product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns.

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the small business concerns Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award
more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier DOD STTR program. Although no government STTR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's STTR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural 
budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3.2% for SBIR in FY 2018. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.

This project provides funding for the pilot administrative program authorized by the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (SEC. 5141. PILOT TO ALLOW FUNDING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, OVERSIGHT, AND CONTRACT PROCESSING COSTS.)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>To enhance transactional efficiency between the Navy laboratories and industry and academic collaborators, the Navy Technology Transfer (T2) Office will revise and update Technology Transfer mechanisms (e.g., Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), PIAs templates, Navy Defense Technology Transfer Information System (NDTTIS) database, online training), Technology Transfer Handbook, Licensing Handbook and Policy Guidance.  It will also execute at least two new pilot programs to embolden innovative T2 efforts at Navy Office of Research and Technology Application (ORTA) activities across laboratories and commercialize Navy laboratory-developed technologies.  Additionally, the T2 Program Office will raise the visibility of Navy technologies through publications, videos, website/social media, marketing and outreach to capitalize on the Navy laboratory developed innovations and systematically drive economic growth in the industrial base, create new services and products and amplify an inclusive technology based economic development.

In order to deliver solutions and capabilities to the acquisition workforce in support of the warfighter, the Navy T2 Program Office will enhance the NDTTIS database to leverage the value/impact of CRADAs.  The Navy-wide T2 Innovation Discovery/Intellectual Property Mining Program will be expanded to identify, license and transition more patentable inventions that provide solutions to acquisition and commercial industry technological challenges that can benefit the warfighter and society.  The Program Office will also lead and participate in national and regional technology transfer industry and academia engagement events to optimize the marketing and outreach of Navy developed inventions and expand on collaboration opportunities with industry and engage with underserved communities and non-traditional partners to advance commercialization.

The Navy T2 Program Office will institute a customer relationship and transaction management system that harmonizes and streamlines the T2 mechanism collaboration process, consolidates the Navy's intellection capital into a single structure through a centrally managed portfolio that will include a marketing analysis component, provide for external and internal stakeholder engagement, licensing and ecosystem landscape analysis to discover and forge opportunities for mutually beneficial T2 commercialization collaborations with academia, economic development agencies and start-up businesses.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>International Cooperative RDT&amp;E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.

Naval War College Strategic Studies Support:  

Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  

Assessment Program: 

The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.


Operations Integration Group:  Classified

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&amp;M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.

The Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.

MTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:

This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations through the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009, 2015, and 2016).Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD)Forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of eleven participating nations (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in multiple Projects and includes a maritime contribution to
the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and
Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.  The MTMD Forum is leveraging At-Sea Demonstration (ASD) test events and operational Fleet Exercises  to integrate technology with concepts of operations developed within MTMD Forum working groups.

The MTMD Forum develops systems and techniques that enhance protection and defense against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the development of interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps. 
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.
(8) Tactical Advancement for Next Generation (TANG) to work with our Allies and International Partners using human-centered design methodologies to identify solutions to technology and sailor performance issues that have been cited during previously conducted experiments, exercises, and demonstrations.  This process will seek to leverage R&amp;D investments and risk reduction research commercial companies are making today that can provide potential "dual use" technology and process solutions to complex problems.

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>PRJ 0149 International Coop RDT&amp;E:
- The increase FY2019 to FY2020 is to support requests for additional ESEP Participation from Partner and Allied Nations.  In addition, this increase continues to support the establishment of the Maritime Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare (M-TASW) effort, providing focus on TASW efforts in the Indo-Pacific region with Japan and Australia.
PRJ 1767 Naval War Col Strategic Studies Supt:
- Naval War Gaming Support - Increased funding from FY 2019 to FY 2020 continues resourcing of the Naval War College's expansion to execute high security war gaming and research.
PRJ 2098 - Navy Postgraduate School (NPS) Studies Support:
- Faculty and Student Studies, Analysis and Research - The decrease from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects fewer studies being conducted in FY 2020.
PRJ 2221 JT Mission Assessment Studies:
- Navy Studies &amp; Analysis - FY 2019 to FY 2020 increase reflects inflation and need for concept studies to inform Fleet architecture and future force structure, continued development of a new model to improve the Navy's capabilities in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) mission-level analysis and increased need for modeling and simulation support for Campaign analysis and ongoing OPNAV missile defense analysis requirements.
PRJ 3017 Enterprise Information Systems:
- Increase in FY 2020 reflects transfer of NGEN corporate funding from 0605861N RDT&amp;E Science and Technology Management.
PRJ 3027 Defense Critical Infrastructure Program:
- Mission Assurance Assessments Support - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 supports assessments concerned with strategic missions that will require follow on mitigation analysis and solution refinement, with potential for persistent cyber network evaluation at multiple sites. Funding addresses the planned assessment support of 32 sites or installations with 10 being OCONUS. Additionally, this tasking covers unplanned events like hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes that threaten DoD installations and supporting infrastructure, as well as 2-3 planned COCOM exercise events (Vigilant Shield, Ardent Sentry, and PANAMAX).
- Cyber Mission Assurance - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects increased research on network mission assurance of defense missions and operations and enhancements of Red Team assessment capabilities. These capabilities increase the amount of time and labor required to maintain awareness of network vulnerabilities during and post-assessment to enhance the mitigations and solutions for cyber security of critical Navy and DoD networks. This persistence increases the costs associated with conducting these evaluations. The increased cost reflects the additional red team members necessary to conduct 2-3 cyber mission assurance assessments per year across DoD and NAVSEA enterprises.
Defense Critical Electric Infrastructure - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects the increased focus on electric grid dependencies and vulnerabilities that Energy Security analysis has revealed and the efforts to increase DoD and Interagency resilience from the natural or manmade effects. 79 installations will need analysis of their critical electric power paths supported by 47 utility providers, entities needed for implementation and execution that require constant attention to ensure reliable data and analytical rigor is applied. Multiple interagency entities will be involved with both exercise (Liberty Eclipse, NERC Grid Ex, and follow on) and potential real world issues involving complex policy and technical guidance, increasing costs to the program to maintain the data from multiple industry databases.
- Mission Assurance Program Management -  The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects the increased oversight from management efforts and utilization of centralized management tool (Innoslate) to better track programmatic requirements and subsequent related tasks, costs, and contracts.
- Defense Critical Infrastructure - The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 supports infrastructure specific asset analysis to particular DoD assets and missions, the Defense Industrial Base, and the supporting infrastructure. To provide a more overarching view of mission analysis, the increase reflects the prototype and use of models based system engineering methods and tools to enhance deliverables being asked for by senior leadership. Congressional legislative pilot studies from NDAA 1647 and 1650 related to cybersecurity of weapons platforms and critical infrastructure are due in 2020 and will need follow on analysis for the multiple weapons platforms and critical infrastructure on at least 2 prioritized sites.
- Defense Critical Mission -  The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflect a larger number of DCMs being assessed during the period of performance. This includes 2-3 sites / installations every other month, necessitating an increase in assessment team members and analytical tools.


PRJ 3312 MTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:
- FY 2020 increase due to ramped up requirements for At-SEA demonstration for Ballistic Missile targeting.
PRJ 3330 - Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Facilities Modernization:
- NRL Facilities Modernization -  The increase in FY 2020 is planned for projects to replace critical equipment in the upgraded and relocated labs across NRL.
PRJ 3363 - PACON Initiative:
- PACOM Initiative -  Increased funding will support more advanced, critical research projects that address China Strategic Initiative Derivation knowledge gaps; further enhancement and refinement of the Critical Factors Analysis suite of analytical tools and products; dramatic increase in both the quality and quantity Emulations at the strategic and operational levels as well as expanded development for the modeling and simulation technologies that support those events; increased scope and support for the INDOPACOM Media Project that will expand to cover all Combatant Commands with added line of effort to cover unique analysis of Chinese media censorship.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

- Research groups continue to conduct focused research, analysis and free-play war gaming of current and future operational challenges and tactical imperatives arising from regional threats, homeland defense and access denial efforts at the high end of the conflict spectrum in the Pacific, European Command (EUCOM), Central Command (CENTCOM) and Northern Command (NORTHCOM) area of responsibility (AOR). Research and analysis efforts continue in those areas above, and will be expanded to include a detailed focus on counter-targeting, operational deception, and countering information denial and missile defense at the theater joint operational level.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This exhibit has been updated to reflect the establishment of the Navy Analytic Office (NAO) which is responsible for the executive oversight of Navy studies and analysis.  The NAO was stood up to better align the annual Analytic Agenda to CNO's strategic priorities while also providing for study of the more tactical requirements of the Fleet and Navy writ large.  The outcome will be synchronized modeling, simulation, assessments, wargames, experiments and exercises providing rich, shared data to support and refine warfighting concepts and to inform budget decisions. 
 
The Navy Assessment Program supports the Analytic Agenda by providing both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare, business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems; warfare systems, and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect warfighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  The Assessment Program provides a broad-view perspective across the Fleet and Navy staff, with an integrated look at both warfighting and warfighting-support programs.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.

This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria. Concept Formulation (CONFORM)/Concept Development and Experimentation (CDE) for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Commands (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class. Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and interoperability gaps of both current and future Navy platforms and systems capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Risks are balanced to deliver the right capabilities within the resources available to Navy.  
- Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities. Determine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. 
- Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research performance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned systems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations and uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results. 
- Develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling/methodology to support analysis. Models/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints. 
- A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.
- Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy.
The May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a CBA to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

A40 provided follow on analysis of additional cyber studies in COCOM regions and specific defense mission assets. They also assisted in looking at how to better synchronize nascent cyber processes and capabilities, such as cyber assessments, cyber key terrain analysis, and Control System inventories into the DCIP methodology.
A40 engaged with CCMDs and Defense Agencies on identifying and developing cyber key terrain data and resilience metrics as they pertain to key critical assets in both public and private domains. A40 analyzed technical and situational Cyber Security information (all threats, particularly industrial control systems) from intelligence message traffic, internet, private sources, other government agencies, national labs, and industry that address cyber control system infrastructure threats and vulnerabilities.
A40 provided guidance, analysis, and technical evaluation and experimentation for Aurora Rotating Equipment Isolation Device (REID) utility engagements and test beds; maintained test data on REIDs with public sector utility companies and utilized private sector engagements to enhance knowledge about the Aurora threat and develop mitigations.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>The funding increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 reflects the increased focus on electric grid dependencies and vulnerabilities that Energy Security analysis has revealed and the efforts to increase DoD and Interagency resilience from the natural or manmade effects.  79 installations will need analysis of their critical electric power paths supported by 47 utility providers, entities needed for implementation and execution that require constant attention to ensure reliable data and analytical rigor is applied.  Multiple interagency entities will be involved with both exercise (Liberty Eclipse, NERC Grid Ex, and follow on) and potential real world issues involving complex policy and technical guidance, increasing costs to the program to maintain the data from multiple industry databases.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations through the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009, 2015, and 2016). Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) Forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of eleven participating nations (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in multiple Projects and includes a maritime contribution to
the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.  The MTMD Forum is leveraging At-Sea Demonstration (ASD) test events and operational Fleet Exercises  to integrate technology with concepts of operations developed within MTMD Forum working groups.

The MTMD Forum develops systems and techniques that enhance protection and defense against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the development of interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps. 
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.
(8) Tactical Advancement for Next Generation (TANG) to work with our Allies and International Partners using human-centered design methodologies to identify solutions to technology and sailor performance issues that have been cited during previously conducted experiments, exercises, and demonstrations.  This process will seek to leverage R&amp;D investments and risk reduction research commercial companies are making today that can provide potential "dual use" technology and process solutions to complex problems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>(1) BMC4I continued engineering analysis and multi-national interoperability gap assessment for the Target Architecture based on test results and continued development of the Target Architecture based on requests for information input from member nations. BMC4I evaluated Possible Point Solutions and provided recommendations for the implementation in correcting coalition interoperability gaps. BMC4I further refined information exchange requirements in preparation for at-sea demonstrations. BMC4I developed updates to MTMD Coalition Capabilities and Interoperability (CCI) and produced the Systems Tactical Data Links Interoperability Report (STIR).

(2) M&amp;S performed analysis of Target Architectures supporting improvement of information exchange requirements identified by BMC4I and the Systems Engineering Team (SET). In support of the MTMD Forum's future capability development, the M&amp;S Working Group continued expansion and development of the M&amp;S lab and integration of new simulation software and further development of virtualization capabilities for the test bed. In support of concept development and experimentation, M&amp;S developed plans for testing of Target Architecture 2, as developed by BMC4I. M&amp;S developed Mission Models to support future concepts such as Force Threat Evaluation (FTE) and Force Weapon Assignment (FWA) (FTEWA) and other Proposed Point Solutions.

(3) CDEP worked with BMC4I and OR working groups to review the Coalition Capabilities and Interoperability (CCI) gaps data set and developed test plans to assess CCI gaps suitable for land-based testing. CDEP planned and conducted Annual Test Event (ATE) 2018 which was focused on Tactical Data Link (TDL) message implementation in Link-16, Link-22, Force Threat Evaluation and Weapons Assignment (FTEWA) and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5.  Laboratory constraints and the Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet) connectivity issues prevented the execution of Link-22 and IFF planned events.  CDEP rescheduled these events for ATE 2019. CDEP released the ATE 2017 Final Data Analysis Test Report which includes lessons learned from the conduct of hardware-in-the-loop tests and provides assessments and recommendations to improve information exchanges required to conduct at-sea demonstrations.

(4) The Open Architecture Working Group (OAWG) began developing the Force Data Model for the Threat Evaluation (TE) Force Level Function (FLF) by analyzing the Data Requirements document and evaluating inputs from other WGs such as: Mission Threads, Target and Reference Architectures. In addition to developing use cases for TE, existing data models such as; Open Architecture Radar Interface Standard (OARIS) and Combat Resource Allocation System (CORALS) are being evaluated for inclusion in the Force Data Model. The Force Data model will be used to develop the FLF component interfaces. The OAWG will collaborate with the BMC4I, M&amp;S, and ORWGs as well as a system experts group to ensure the Force Data model aligns with the Target and Reference Architectures as well as selected Possible Point Solutions (PPSs). Preliminary technical exchanges have also begun with M&amp;S to ensure the Force Level Open Architecture Technical Standard (FLOATS) can be exercised in the M&amp;S environment. The FLOATS PA amendment was signed to add Netherlands and extend the term of the project by 16 months to expire in June 2019.

(5) TPEX continued preparations for MTMD participation as part of ongoing at-sea test event continuums. TPEX was vital in the planning, execution, and reporting of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) events in support of Formidable Shield 17, a SIXTH Fleet led, STRIKFORNATO-executed Fleet exercise in support of maritime IAMD live fire operations in order to build interoperability and demonstrate IAMD command and control. FS-17 was supported by MTMD Forum member nation ships from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and was executed in the beginning of FY18. TPEX will leverage events in Exercises Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 and Pacific Dragon (PD) 2018 scheduled in August of FY18. These at-sea demonstrations will include live tracking events and a combination of live and simulated IAMD engagements. RIMPAC 18/PD 18 will be supported by MTMD Forum member nation ships from Canada, Australia, and the United States.  Planning for At-Sea Demonstrations (ASD) and follow-on at-sea testing will continue into future years and include target configuration/procurement.  Future planning in FY18 included Formidable Shield 2019, ASD 2020, and ASD 2021.

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>Increased funds will be utilized to support conduct of At-Sea Demonstration 2020 (ASD 20) and Exercise Formidable Shield 2021 (FS 21) that are planned for 4th quarter FY 2020 and FY 2021, respectively. These demonstrations will involve simultaneous presentation of targets representing ballistic and cruise missile threats to create scenarios that represent the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) threat environment maritime forces now face when deployed. Specifically, these funds will be used to procure sounding rockets that represent the ballistic missile threat, and long lead material items: Oriole solid fuel rocket motors, thrust vane controllers (for guidance accuracy function), and system integration for all up round (AUR) buildup. The sounding rockets will be used during conduct of ASD 20 and the completed AURs are planned to be launched in FS 21. This demonstration enables maritime forces to demonstrate IAMD capability and new concepts for increased mission effectiveness, while enabling assessment of IAMD interoperability with our allies in this complex and challenging mission area. Major elements of these efforts include: ballistic target shipping and buildup, test planning and analysis, and combat system integration within the Tactical Data Link architecture that supports and enables the exercises. At the completion of each ASD event, thorough data analysis will be performed to identify interoperability issues and opportunities for the next event. Additionally, identification of systems integration, technology development and Fleet training needs, along with lessons learned, will be brought forward and implemented prior to the next ASD event. The plan is to execute an underway fleet-led event or demonstration with maritime forces at an average rate of one per year in order to increase our interoperability in the IAMD arena with our International Partners and Allies.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Operational Emulation (OE) is meeting or exceeding program milestones, and is pacing ahead of expected developmental timeline. As the OE program continues to mature, it is also expanding as required to meet the overall mandate of supporting extensive studies and analyses for the operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Initiative. In FY 2017, OE conducted a beta intelligence forum and its first "live" intelligence forum, and is on pace to conduct an intelligence forum every two months in FY18. Currently for each two-month cycle, OE conducts an operational forum, intelligence forum, and extensive modeling and simulation using a variety of analytic tools. The first operationally-focused forum was conducted in June 2018, and the program is on track to conduct one every two months for the rest of FY 2018.

OE provides operational planners and intelligence subject matter experts (SMEs) with highly structured and repeatable processes with which to develop, test, and refine concepts. OE now includes separate, but interrelated, operational and intelligence-focused events utilizing highly-qualified SMEs to provide qualitative analysis, and robust modeling and simulation for quantitative analysis. The OE program is maturing through extensive participation by operational planners and intelligence SMEs, and continues to yield significant insights that fundamentally influence the development of operational plans.


Operational Decision Analysis (ODA). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on ODA sub Line of Effort support effort with at least 80% of initial objectives being achieved by 3QTR FY 2018.

ODA provides funding to support continuing requirement for studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). The PE directly support CSIs Strategic Emulation LOE and will provide critical technical inputs and strategic insights that complement the programs OE output database, which is still under development. ODA outputs will significantly enhance Combatant Component Command staffs with their operational and intelligence planning and global synchronization across multiple domains amongst all geographic and functional combatant commands.  

Decision Support Elements to Operational Emulation Modeling and Simulation (DSEOMS). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on this major LOE with at least 80% of initial objectives being met by 3QTR FY 2019.

DSEOMS provides funding to support all four major LOEs for the CSI program and all its sub-LOEs. This effort will provide a comprehensive and campaign-quality decision support toolset to decision makers across the entire CSI enterprise: OSD, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Intelligence Community, and the Whole of US Government (Interagency). This PE will create a set of enhanced automated and doctrinal decision- making tools to assist key policy- and strategic leaders on a full spectrum of contingencies related to competitor nations. DSEOMS will provide analytic modeling and simulation tools that take inputs from all major CSI program LOEs; the goal being to present decision- and policy-makers and their planning staffs with a rich dataset of information that is relevant, timely, and substantive for their respective problem sets. The current scope and focus across all LOEs is to support emerging near-term and longer-term planning to both significantly enhance war planning orientation and force posture considerations but also to significantly enhance more informed strategic choices regarding future joint/service capability investments and joint/service operational concepts across all strategic domains.   Ultimately, fully integrated program deliverables will guide a deliberative process for identifying efficiencies in major service platform decisions to ensure they are optimized for the full-spectrum of projected adversary capabilities in the future.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:Text>The Naval Research Laboratory continues to address emergent and planned facilities sustainment and modernization projects.  These efforts will ensure the laboratory can conduct a broadly based multidisciplinary program of scientific research and advanced technological development to meet current and future threats to naval forces.  The funding provided in FY 2018 via this Congressional Add allowed the command to accelerate the submission of crucial projects whose delay due to availability of resources would have negatively impacted ongoing and planned research efforts focused on increasing naval warfighting technological advantage over near-peer competitors.  Anticipated awards in FY 2018 include but are not limited to replacement of electrical panels that support materials science and technology research which requires steady state electrical power to operate multi-million dollar additive manufacturing equipment used to develop next generation metallic and ceramic complex structural materials; replacement of transformers that provide power to the Nike Laser Facility used to conduct research in plasma physics and potential directed energy weapons development; and replacement of transformers and switching gear that supports multiple departments responsible for research and engineering related to naval space technology efforts in the areas of component design, mechanical systems development, electronic systems development, control systems development, and design test and processing of materials and systems ensuring reliable and robust use of this critical environment in support of naval operations.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This continuing program provides support for ships and aircraft required to accommodate Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of new systems. The RDT&amp;E ship and aircraft inventory is required to adequately test new and improved weapon systems, stay current with threats, and increase warfighting capability of the fleet. The program provides integrated logistics support for aircraft at selected field activities; provides depot-level rework of aircraft, engines, and components for the Navy inventory of RDT&amp;E aircraft; and provides support for ships and aircraft bailed to contractors for Navy RDT&amp;E projects. Costs covered under this element include aircrew training and proficiency, fuel, supplies, equipment, repair, Aviation Depot Level Repairables, overhaul of ships and aircraft, as well as organizational, intermediate, and depot maintenance of ships and aircraft in the Navy RDT&amp;E inventory.


JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Project 2924: The 2017 Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) report identified numerous material issues that has resulted in an increase in the required labor and consumable parts to accomplish routine preventive maintenance to prevent recurrence of identified deficiencies and material degradation of ship Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) Systems.  FY 2020 funding increase of $1.33M from PB 2019 to PB 2020 is to support the accomplishment of this routine maintenance.  Without the increase in funding, the Self Defense Test Ship risks being placed in Do Not Operate status, which will negatively impact the Navy's ability to conduct realistic live fire testing in support of CVN 78, Littoral Combat Ship and LSD 52 Class Amphibious Ship Self Defense Systems. 

Project 3206 - $1.2M FY 2020 TOA decrease from PB 2019 to PB 2020 is due to Underexecution Issue of $1.0M and realignment of $200k from PU 3206 to PU 3238 Threat Engineering. 

Project 0569: The funding decrease of approximately $7.0 million reflects a reduction in planned depot events for NAVAIR RDT&amp;E aircraft - primarily driven by DON decisions to retire legacy FA-18 aircraft, and the grounding of NAVAIR C-130's due to propeller issues, resulting in delay of those depot inductions.

Project 3238: Project was established to support the Acquisition Threat Evaluation Projects (ATEP). Funding was realigned within the PE from project 3206 T&amp;E Enterprise. 

The FY 2020 request was reduced by $2.5 million to reflect the availability of prior year execution balances.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Aircraft Support. This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&amp;E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Aircraft Structure Periodic Adjustments (ASPA), Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, Aviation Climate Assessment Survey System (ACASS) and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&amp;E requirements.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T&amp;E Enterprise consolidates all Air Warfare (AW) Ship Self Defense (SSD) at-sea testing across multiple class ships, beginning with LHD 8, LSD 52, LHA 6, DDG 1000, CVN 78, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.

Enterprise Cost elements:

a) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.

b) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LSD 52, DDG 1000, LCS and CVN 78.

c) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LSD 50, LCS and CVN 78.

d) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).

e) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.

f) Maintenance of Combat System (CS) includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.

The T&amp;E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&amp;E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Threat Engineering produces Acquisition Threat Evaluation Products (ATEPs) that are inputs to System of System requirements across Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS) platforms, elements, and DoD systems to deliver scalable fleet level performance capability. This program also produces critical, valid T&amp;E assets that satisfy Commander Operational Test &amp; Evaluation Force (COTF) and Director of Operational Test and Evaluation  (DOT&amp;E) requirements as these same tools will be used to support and supplement test and evaluation and training against the assessed threats in both testbed and at-sea configurations, ensuring consistency between the development and T&amp;E acquisition phases.  

ATEP is the surface navy cost effective, affordable, single, common threat modeling architecture that supports its Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), (and other subordinate programs) RDT&amp;E activities throughout the acquisition life cycle and extending through operations and sustainment. ATEP satisfies Life Cycle Mission Planning (LCMP) requirements by providing the threat modeling architecture needs to support systems engineering trade-off analysis, T&amp;E (DT and OT) and operations and sustainment (OA) through testbed evaluation activities.  ATEP is a critical component in ensuring requirements are achievable, affordable and testable.

ATEP provides the required threat models to ensure fleet operational readiness against the threat. Specifically, ATEP Satisfies Operational Test (OT) and Operational Assessment (OA) requirements including COMOPTEVFOR requirement (COMOPTEVFOR Memo, 3960, SER 00/244 of 29 April 2016).  This requirement specifies ATEP is necessary to provide the surface navy validated Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat models for use in the M&amp;S infrastructure supporting OT&amp;E.  Moreover, ATEP satisfies COMOPTEVFOR requirement that threat models must be at a fidelity commensurate with the blue-force system representations and contain intel-derived lethality/vulnerability data, physics-based six degrees-of-freedom models, reactive seekers and guidance, and other engineering data.  ATEP is necessary to evaluate mandatory Key Performance Parameters including operational effectiveness, and suitability to include a systems lethality and survivability, and achieving its performance requirements within operation and sustainment costs.

ATEP provides the threat models necessary to ensure the surface navy 1.) Avoids Technological Surprise and 2.) Eliminates Point Solutions. ATEP satisfies necessary Threat model requirements to conduct warfare systems analysis of alternatives including gaps analysis, and threat systems mission and performance analysis and effectiveness studies supporting both material and non-material solutions while supporting the development of Intelligence Community Tasking Threat. 

With Threat Engineering efforts and development of ATEPs the Navy and PEO IWS will produce substantiated risk and cost based Fleet Level Engineering decisions producing predictable and timely fleet capability against stressing threats. Scalable warfighting performance will be evaluated against the appropriate threat environment, using sufficient, verified and validated models applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis. 

Without Threat Engineering efforts and ATEPs the Navy and the PEO will incur unsubstantiated risk and cost in developing capability for the fleet. Scalable warfighting performance will not be evaluated against the threat environment, sufficient models will not be developed or applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a detachment of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, the mission of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center is to provide the US Navy an underwater range facility for full-spectrum test and evaluation of Undersea Warfare systems and for Fleet training and readiness assessment.  The Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center  Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  

Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  

Major test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 /Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 30 undersea target Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.

Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier/marine area include fully equipped machine /fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides continuing maintenance and operational support for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Test and Evaluation capabilities.  These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and Test and Evaluation  aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its Test and Evaluation mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range, which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.  This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is a new start FY17 program which funds the overhauls and preventative maintenance of the 23 Major Range and Test Facility Base marine vessels located at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, Pacific Missile Range Facility, Honolulu, HI, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport, WA, Naval Air Warfare Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD, and Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center. These vessels are used to launch and recover torpedoes, acoustic systems, and other weapons, provide range surveillance and clearance, and can be configured as a target.  Overhauls are required to operate ships over 300 tons overseas in compliance with American Bureau of Shipping "Load Line" certification requirements.  Major preventative maintenance requiring shipyard support is also performed during these periods to mitigate risks of failures.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2019 to FY 2020 funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD.  DoD mandated an increase in Cyber Security testing due to an increase in cyber intrusions from adversaries.  Cyber intrusions continue to challenge our weapon systems' ability to detect threats, react to threats, and restore system functionality after a cyber-attack.  Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets, and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.

The FY 2019 to FY 2020 funding increase also supports the Network Modernization effort.  Part of this modernization will strengthen COMOPTEVFOR's presence on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and enhance collaboration, access and data flow to stakeholders operating on NMCI. COMOPTEVOR legacy unclassified and classified networks prevent collaboration, sharing, and access to operational test tools, test results, and data with Commands that work for COMOPTEVOR while executing operational testing (VX-1, VX-9, VMX-1, HMX-1), organizations that use operational test products (SYSCOMs, PEO/PMs, Fleet Shore Commands), and VCNO, OPNAV Resource Sponsors, and ASN/RDA.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating expenses and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives during the conduct of independent operational testing and evaluation. This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness, suitability, and cyber survivability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop "minimum, adequate" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT Network, database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>The FY 2019 to FY 2020 funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD.  DoD mandated an increase in Cyber Security testing due to an increase in cyber intrusions from adversaries.  Cyber intrusions continue to challenge our weapon systems' ability to detect threats, react to threats, and restore system functionality after a cyber-attack.  Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets, and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.

The FY 2019 to FY 2020 funding increase also supports the Network Modernization effort.  Part of this modernization will strengthen COMOPTEVFOR's presence on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and enhance collaboration, access and data flow to stakeholders operating on NMCI. COMOPTEVOR legacy unclassified and classified networks prevent collaboration, sharing, and access to operational test tools, test results, and data with Commands that work for COMOPTEVOR while executing operational testing (VX-1, VX-9, VMX-1, HMX-1), organizations that use operational test products (SYSCOMs, PEO/PMs, Fleet Shore Commands), and VCNO, OPNAV Resource Sponsors, and ASN/RDA.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As indicated in section A above, funding provides for core headquarters operations and support (O&amp;S) costs related to required operational testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) conducted in support of Navy acquisition programs. The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&amp;S costs for day to day operations of the staff/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&amp;E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&amp;S costs typical of military field commands/activities). Within this project, over 1/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&amp;E offices/activities, and miscellaneous other customers/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            
                              
Number of Tests Conducted - FY 2018 = 110; FY 2019 = 112; FY 2020 = 114
Number of Programs Supported - FY 2018 = 424; FY 2019 = 427; FY 2020 = 430</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Radio Frequency (RF) Management Program. This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. 

(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations. It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems, as well as for the Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessments.

(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.

(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.

(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program (RTSO). The program researches the Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental Effects (E3)between shipboard transmitters and receivers on ships and the interactions of the EM systems within the other systems installed on units within a strike group.  The program will develop a capability to monitor the EM Spectrum Usage on a ship and be able to validate the spectrum plan to ensure Electromagnetic Capability (EMC) is achieved within the strike group.  The program will develop a capability to display compliance with the spectrum plan in a Common Operational Picture (COP) display.  These initial capabilities of Own Force Monitoring provide Battlespace Awareness and will be instrumental in enabling Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare.  These capabilities of self-awareness will further enhance the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain. 

At the direction of OPNAV, in the beginning of FY2018 the project changed the technical approach to mitigate cost, schedule, and performance risks associated with the original Hardware (H/W) solution that required extensive
integration and networking of all spectrum dependent systems.  The revised technical approach simplifies the original hardware plan required in favor of a centralized radio frequency monitoring capability with software applications that can still meet fleet requirements of own force monitoring.  This has resulted in near term schedule delay that is recoverable in FY19.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Real-Time Spectrum Operations (RTSO) Program researches the Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental Effects (E3) between shipboard transmitters and receivers on ships and the interactions of the EM systems within the other systems installed on units within a strike group. The program will develop a capability to monitor the EM Spectrum Usage on navy platforms and be able to validate the spectrum plan to ensure Electromagnetic Capability (EMC) is achieved within the strike group. The program will develop a capability to display compliance with the spectrum plan in a Common Operational Picture (COP) display. These initial capabilities of Own Force Monitoring provide Battlespace Awareness and will be instrumental in enabling Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW). These capabilities of self-awareness will further enhance the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to rapidly and with certainty: 1) exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) understand the disposition of friendly and adversarial forces, as well as uninvolved/neutral elements in the area of operations; 3) have access to target quality intelligence at the right time to conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries, and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) supports the material acquisition process by managing the Marine Corps Operational Test (OT) programs for Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I through ACAT IV (less OT of manned aircraft) and performs other functions that may be directed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.

Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) consists of equipment, systems, and services designed to provide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces the capabilities needed to effectively respond to a terrorist attack using Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE). FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research &amp; Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Wargaming capability efforts are focused within multiple areas to include identifying, defining, and documenting requirements and capabilities; directing cyber security support for initiatives to boost information assurance in the areas of modeling &amp; simulation, network configuration, security control validation, and type accreditation; development of performance specifications; and modeling and simulation prototyping efforts.  The wargaming capability facilitates the assessment and evaluation of operating and functional concepts, operational and technology-based approaches, current concepts of operations, and principles and methods that inform decisions in support of force development and requirements generation.  Wargaming capability results are used to develop, assess, and refine future operating and functional concepts across the full range of military operations (ROMO).  Additionally, they test current OPLANS and CONOPS; examine operational and tactical actions through repeated, multiple iterations; enable the full development of concepts through opportunities for examination and evaluation; assess capability investments while guiding capability resourcing actions and informing the POM development; and provide education and leadership development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Environment (IE) is a global, interconnected, complex, continuously changing eco-system that is increasingly connected across our war fighting functions. Given the complexity and the speed of changes in the IE and to address the significant role information now plays in current and future conflicts, a unifying operational and technical strategy must be developed to outpace our adversaries.
Analysis will inform the development and integration of Marine Corps Information Environment Operations (IE Ops) that are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan, Marine Corps Operating Concepts (MOC).  Research and analysis efforts support: design and coordinated implementation of an Objective Network to fight on and through a contested environment; design and collaboration on a Naval Tactical Grid and a Joint Tactical Grid; a threat estimate to inform capability development; and analysis to inform the development and fielding of an integrated information capability.  These efforts will be accomplished leveraging analytic support from government Labs and Industry to dynamically exploit our National Defense Strategy (NDS) priority operational problems related to the Information Environment through limited user evaluations and functional capability assessments with Marines. In addition, rapid development of capabilities to address problems in the IE Ops will be developed utilizing the Accelerator process which utilizes best commercial practice of design thinking.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Allied/Coalition Maritime Environment (ACME) 0798:
This project promotes interoperability with allied and coalition forces by facilitating maritime interoperability in both processes and communication systems, including emerging capabilities, to counter growing high-end asymmetric threats. 

Space &amp; Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering 2144:
This project is a systems engineering non-acquisition program to develop, test, implement Technical Authority (TA) products, and validate Naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System architectures to support naval, Joint and Coalition missions across normal, contested, and degraded cyber/operational environments.  The objective of this project is carried out by multiple tasks that ensure development and delivery of naval Information Warfare (IW) capabilities that are well-integrated, interoperable, secure, and resilient to meet validated warfighting requirements.  

The Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Architecture 2147:
This project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR POR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture.

Fleet Experimentation 3319:  
The U.S. Navy's Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) project advances/augments operational and tactical warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The main focus of FLEX between 2018 and 2024 is to operationalize "A Design For Maintaining Maritime Superiority" Blue Line of Effort (LOE) through the execution of Fleet Design materiel/non-materiel capability employment.  

Trident Warrior Project 3320: 
The U.S. Navy's Trident Warrior (TW) experimentation campaign enables early delivery of capabilities to the warfighter via Fleet-directed Trident Warrior operational events with an emphasis on United States Fleet Forces/Commander Pacific Fleet (USFF/CPF) directed focus areas. 
  
Maritime Communications Demonstration Project 3420:
Classified Project Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) is not a new start.  Funding was realigned from project 3319 FLEX in FY18. The Expeditionary SFOC Communications is developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both materiel and non-materiel methodologies to provide resilient command and control within the maritime domain.  Identified previous work done within OSD channels, and will leverage lessons learned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The ACME program advances Information Warfare (IW) (to include Command, Control, Communications, Computers; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Electronic Warfare (EW); and Cyber Warfare), interoperability with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States (AUSCANNZUKUS), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other Allied and Coalition partners. The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACME program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy (USN) expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Mission Partner Environment/ Future Mission Networking (MPE/FMN), the U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System - eXtended (BICES-X), and with the Joint Information Environment (JIE).
Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Denied, Degraded, Intermittent and Low-bandwidth (DDIL) operations, and to counter Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) threats. Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich IW data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, to include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities as well as Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in secure data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support Navy objectives in advancing Information Warfare (IW) capabilities, the Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering project provides six main functions:

(1) Develop the architectures, specifications and standards, tools, and processes to support a single integrated Navy plan for cybersecurity. These engineering artifacts provide Navy specific guidance to drive common and consistent implementation of security controls across current and future Navy Programs of Record/projects. This eliminates redundancies and inefficiencies characteristic of previous stove-pipe development efforts in which each system addressed security individually. These efforts enable a standardized approach to move out faster to improve the Navy's cyber resiliency. 

(2) Provide the cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability which supports cybersecurity test requirements and the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) components of USS Secure. USS Secure is a cyber assessment program within the Navy. This System of Systems (SoS) (Afloat, Aloft, C4I &amp; Shore) capability in a test laboratory environment provides a rapidly re-configurable capability that integrates maritime hardware systems into a virtual platform. This platform level SoS provides cybersecurity research, development, test and evaluation, and training, not otherwise possible. This combination of Systems Commands (SYSCOM) laboratories, cyber ranges, and Red Teams simulating Navy platforms in operational maritime environments is critical for effectively evaluating cyber threats against specified mission threads.

(3) Define an integrated Enterprise Architecture to support design, development and delivery of integrated Navy Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System capabilities. This architecture reflects current (as-is) and future (target) end states to support technical analyses, program planning, and enterprise-level investment decisions across IW capabilities. Perform mission based system of systems analysis to ensure integration and interoperability, and validate end-to-end warfighting capabilities to quickly address emerging threats. 

(4) Provides engineering tools and processes to drive rigorous Systems Engineering discipline across the acquisition lifecycle to support rapid development and delivery of secure and interoperable C4ISR, Business IT, and Space Systems capabilities that meet Fleet requirements. Conduct Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) to provide independent, objective assessments of technical maturity and compliance with applicable architectures, specifications and standards across IW capabilities. 

(5) The Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX) provides a means to demonstrate and evaluate the interoperability of United States (US), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and coalition information sharing systems.

(6) Navy Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology aligns to CNO priorities to deliver revolutionary capabilities to improve fleet readiness.  These enterprise solutions will provide the foundation to (1) enhance warfighter capability through new innovative system designs; (2) increase readiness through low volume production of hard to source items; and (3) improve warfighting capacity by enabling production at or near the point of need. Specific efforts include the development of an Enterprise Digital Manufacturing Architecture which addresses design and certification of AM capabilities for both afloat and ashore, development of Cyber Security Risk Management Profiles for devices and applications on operational networks, definition of a secure Technical Data Package to describe components that can be digitally manufactured, and the development of an overarching, enterprise-level Digital Manufacturing Thread (device management, digital rights management, licensing, configuration management, data storage rule/access and application programing interfaces).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Integrated architectures provide a technical framework for assessing capability gaps and performance of individual systems and System of Systems (SoS) and their ability to effectively provide the desired effects to support warfighting missions. They also serve as a means to influence and drive Programs of Record (PoR) toward a common, more efficient state that promotes interoperability and security.

The Naval Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Reference Architecture project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment and Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment and Space &amp; Naval Warfare Systems Command-wide Enterprise Architecture policies. This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR PoR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture. These efforts will reduce Information Technology/ISR infrastructure complexity and variances, making it easier to manage, operate and defend our ISR capabilities, and help inform investment decisions across the Navy's ISR enterprise to support Assured Command and Control, Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires.

This effort will encompass the documentation and analysis of current ISR enterprise architectures to inform and guide requirements for target architecture development and performance requirements to support full use and incorporation of ISR capabilities to advance Navy operations afloat. The associated studies will produce both technical and non-technical implementation guidance across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities spectrum.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The U.S. Navy's Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program examines doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPFP) solutions to identified warfighter capability gaps within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). The Navy's FLEX program considers warfighting gaps identified in: Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL) generated by Warfighting Development Centers (WDC); Navy Integrated Priorities Letter (IPL); Navy Commanders' FLEX Guidance; and Navy Urgent Operational Needs Statements. Additionally, the Navy's FLEX program addresses innovative concepts, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps. Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war simulations, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Naval-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&amp;T), academia, and industry partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The U.S. Navy's Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program is a collaborative effort with multiple partners designed to address fleet prioritized capability gaps to produce doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions. FLEX program deliverables are focused on operational and tactical warfighting capabilities prioritized near term (within the Future Years Defense Program). U.S. Navy staff manages DOTMLPF-P actions resulting from experiment execution to establish or enhance warfighting capability in Fleet Design, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Surface Warfare (SUW), Strike Warfare (STW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Expeditionary Warfare (EXW), Information Warfare (IW), Mine Warfare (MIW) and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP).  

FLEX supports Operational/Tactical venues to experiment, demonstrate, and assess warfighting CONOPS development, concepts, doctrine/training development, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and technologies. Multi-year experiment campaigns focus on warfighting capability in accordance with U.S. Navy guidance to evaluate and transition  DOTMLPF-Policy change recommendations.</r2:Description>

Experimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities.  The FLEX Execution Plan supported the following events: 

ELECTROMAGNETIC MANEUVER WARFARE (EMW) EXPERIMENTATION
Navy conducted multiple events designed to synchronize and align experiment initiatives with EMW campaign tasks to provide solutions to EMW capability gaps and to ensure development of doctrine is synchronized with the introduction of new technology in order to provide the Fleet and Fleet trainers with required capabilities at the tactical and operational levels. Specific events completed in FY18 include:

RIMPAC 18 AT-SEA EXPERIMENT - This event, leveraged the fleet assets and at-sea time associated with a major Pacific fleet training exercise, Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018. The effort evaluated technology and/or TTP-related initiatives to close warfighting gaps identified across multiple POM-20 Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCLs).

SPECTRAL TSUNAMI 2018 SEMINAR WAR SIMULATION - This event, held 09-13 July 2018 and sponsored by OPNAV N2N6, was comprised of stakeholders from across the Navy to define the baseline warfighting scenario and existing technical capabilities to form an Integrated Technical Capabilities Baseline (ITCB). The war simulation identified areas of strengths and weaknesses, areas for improving operational effectiveness and hardware/software changes necessary to improve existing POR systems or suggest requirements for new capability. The war simulation built upon the results of the 2017 war simulation and the scope was expanded to include select coalition capabilities and participants.

NAVY TACTICAL GRID ENABLERS 2018 AT-SEA EXPERIMENT - This continued effort to operationalize the Navy Tactical Grid leveraged STORMFORCE 2018, a National Security Agency (NSA)-sponsored Five Eyes tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT) interoperability-focused experiment from 07-11 May 2018 to examine and enhance integration and interoperability of sensors, networks, data fusion, and analytic capabilities across national, theater, and organic platforms. The effort also involved an MQ-4C Triton Workshop completed 22-24 May 2018 that examined concepts of operation and employment of the Triton unmanned air system in preparation for an early operational deployment in late 2018. The final phase of this effort occurred during exercise VALIANT SHIELD 2018 from 11-23 September 2018.

STRIKE GROUP-ORGANIC, LONG ENDURANCE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) experiment (now referred to as the Maritime - Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAS Workshop) - This effort, held 24-27 July 2018, examined the employment of long endurance UAVs organic to a Carrier or Expeditionary Strike Group - a capability that will provide unit level ships with the ability to transport intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike payloads long distances from the host platform.

OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH (ONR) TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION GAMES (TIGS)- This series of workshops executed in conjunction with ONR gave Fleet operators the opportunity to examine emerging capabilities and determine potential concepts of employment to effectively incorporate innovative capabilities into Fleet warfighting missions and tasks.  Technologies examined include: High Power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS); Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel (MDUSV) Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Concept of Employment; and Unmanned System Super Swarms.

ASSURED COMMAND AND CONTROL (AC2) PROTOTYPE AT SEA EXPERIMENT - This effort, held in September 2018, leveraged fleet assets and at-sea time to conduct an extended evaluation of an emerging technology in support of EMW objectives.

MARITIME CYBERSPACE EXPERIMENT - This classified effort built upon prior year experiments to further examine U.S. Navy vulnerabilities to adversary cyber threats.

COUNTER-UNMANNED SYSTEMS (C-UXS) EXPERIMENT SERIES - This effort built upon the 2017 counter-UAV experiment by examining emerging TTPs and technologies to counter the proliferation of unmanned undersea, surface, and air vehicles. The series involved three distinct efforts: the observation of at-sea testing of non-kinetic counter-UAS technologies from October - December 2017; a counter small UAS (C-sUAS) TTP workshop from 13-16 February 2018, and the Black Dart Maritime at-sea experiment of several kinetic and non-kinetic C-UxS capabilities from 04-08 June 2018. Black Dart Maritime also included a demonstration of ONR's unmanned system "super swarm" capability.

NAVAL FORCE INTEGRATION EXPERIMENTATION
Naval Force Integration experimentation in 2018 examined integration and interoperability issues associated with coordinated USN-USMC operations. The primary goal was to reexamine Navy and Marine Corps organizational and command relationships in order to enable effective Naval operations across the maritime domain. Specific events completed in FY18 include:

NAVAL INTEGRATION IN SUPPORT OF DISTRIBUTED MARITIME OPERATIONS (NI-DMO) War Simulation - Originally called Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE), this USFF and MARFORCOM sponsored war simulation, completed 05-09 February 2018, focused on operational level objectives and examined how a Fleet Commander task organizes to achieve sea control in complex, contested environments.

MINE WARFARE (MIW) EXPERIMENTATION
Through workshops, war simulation and at-sea events, the FY 18 efforts continued to examine TTP and Command and Control (C2) construct for the future Mine Counter Measure (MCM) force as new programs of record and unmanned systems come on line, and legacy systems begin to decommission. Specific events completed in FY18 include:

                                        <r2:Text>The Navy's FY20 FLEX program aligns to U.S. Navy's Fleet Design and associated Campaign Plan and will drive implementation of Fleet Design by 2023.  

The Navy will continue to provide experiment, analytical and naval mission subject matter expertise support throughout the planning and execution process; identify fleet warfighting deficiencies through experimentation; identify and capture innovative solutions for fleet experiments that address prioritized fleet warfighting gaps; and identify suitable events to support execution of the following experimentation campaigns:

FLEET DESIGN EXPERIMENTS
Aligning with CNO's Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority, the emerging ""Fleet Design"" concept has been developed and promulgated. Development of the supporting doctrine, TTP, Command and control (C2), as well as the integration and interoperability required between weapon systems and decision makers, requires a methodical experimental approach. FY 20 experiments (both at-sea and via war simulations) will strive to achieve the objectives laid out in the Fleet Design action/implementation plan. 

Specific events planned for FY20 include:

OPERATIONAL LEVEL OF WAR/TACTICAL LEVEL OF WAR OLW/TLW) INTEGRATION EXPERIMENTATION
OLW/TLW integration experiments (workshops, war simulations and at-sea events) will examine current and emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures TTPs) and current and emerging technologies with a goal of identifying innovative solutions that will support the capstone naval concept of a Fleet Design based on integration, distribution, and maneuver. 

HUMAN-MACHINE INTEGRATION(HMI) AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) EXPERIMENTATION - This effort will examine the incorporation of AI capabilities into Naval technologies, TTPs, and C2 processes such as the development of AI-enabled Tactical Decision Aids that autonomously transition data into information.

ELECTROMAGNETIC MANEUVER WARFARE(EMW) EXPERIMENTATION
Navy will conduct multiple events designed to synchronize and align experiment initiatives with EMW tasks to provide solutions to EMW capability gaps and to ensure development of doctrine and TTP is synchronized with the introduction of new technology and provides the Fleet and Fleet trainers with required doctrine tools at the tactical and operational levels.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) project, also called the Expeditionary Submarine Fiber Optic Cable (SFOC) Communications Project, is a classified program responsible for developing concepts designed to validate material and non-material solutions providing resilient Command and Control (C2) within the maritime domain. The focus is to demonstrate capabilities leveraging existing DOD investments and infrastructure to move data and information. Demonstration will include maritime assets, experimental methodologies, and current backhaul architecture for data movement. Solutions will address technologies across the Radio Frequency (RF) and Optical spectrum using SFOC communications systems. The key deliverable will be a series of at sea demonstrations to validate maritime segment components in an operationally representative environment.  This is not a new start.  In FY17 $2.8M of funding was managed from within the Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program and used for MCD project tasking for transparency. This effort is part of Secretary of Defense's (SECDEF) third offset initiative and was identified as a required operational capability by USEUCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USSTRATCOM. This effort will fund limited technical development and a series of at-sea demonstrations raising the technical readiness levels of various components with a cable handling and deployment system in an operationally representative environment, with the intent to rapidly transition to an operational capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This effort provides an OT&amp;E approach to protect Marine Corps critical Cyber information and intelligence through vulnerability evaluations of all major DoD weapons systems and critical military installations; as directed by Section 1650 of Public Law 114-328 (NDAA for FY2017) and Section 1647 of Public Law 114-92 (NDAA FY2016). This will be accomplished through protection, detection, response, restoration, remediation, and mitigation. Testing and evaluation will be completed at Marine Corps facilities and Government Labs, to include the Marine Corps Cyber Range, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA).

Sec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. 

Sec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. 

Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Assessments will end in 2020 with the submission of the final report. Strategies mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Funding will be used for assessments and non-recurring engineering for mitigations related to the  Navy's major weapons systems identified in Joint Requirements Oversight Committee Memorandum (JROCM) 039-16 and on prioritized critical shore infrastructure prioritized.

Sec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. 

Sec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. 

Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize Department of Energy (DoE) and Department of Defense (DoD) national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress. Strategies and procedures for mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Vulnerability Assessments and Evaluations program funds cyber vulnerability assessments of critical shore infrastructure as directed by Section 1650 of the FY17 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  Funding will be used for assessments of prioritized critical shore infrastructure.  Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize DoE and DoD national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress. Strategies and procedures for mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Conduct comprehensive red (penetration-level), blue team assessments, and non-recurring engineering for mitigations identified related to facility related control systems.  This includes those systems integrated into, as well as supporting, critical infrastructure for the Navy. As directed by Congressional language, these all-inclusive vulnerability assessments will require the development of multifaceted testing capabilities within the Navy shore domain while leveraging existing resources across the Fleet in addition to strategies and competencies from our national laboratory partners. Supporting these vulnerability assessments will be the identification and development of mission modeling artifacts outlining the relationship between those identified facility related control systems and the relevant DoD and Navy mission and operational plans. These efforts will provide increased survivability and cyber resiliency of the Naval shore domain.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Navy Counter Insider Threat Capability (CITC) meets National, Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of the Navy (DoN) direction to deter, detect, and mitigate the threat from witting and unwitting insiders.  Counter Insider Threat program accomplishes these objectives by monitoring users' computers and network activities, fusing that information with security risk data from multiple other sources, and providing the fused information to analysts for threat identification and initial response action.  All agencies that manage classified networks are required to establish an Insider Threat program consisting of User Activity Monitoring (UAM) and an Analytical Hub.  As a Presidential Directive, Navy will come under increased Congressional scrutiny if Insider Threat does not maintain funding.

Navy currently does not fully meet CITC requirements.  As the CITC Mission requires Navy to establish a new capability to identify a specific type of person, as defined above, RDT&amp;E,N funding is required to appropriately develop and integrate this capability effectively.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

MHA Functions supported more than 400 Programs and HQ support needs to include:
 

-Financial Management Systems:  Fund execution was accomplished through the use of Standard Accounting Budgeting Reporting System(SABRS), Standard Accounting and Reporting system - Field Level (STARS-FL), Defense Travel System (DTS), Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF), Electronic Business Suite (EB Suite), and Electronic Document Access (EDA) for current and prior year financial transactions.

-Financial Management Analysis: The mission, functions, and tasks of the command were met through funds allocated from the following appropriations: RDT&amp;E, OMN, APN, OPN, and DoD.  Funds were authorized, committed, obligated, and executed IAW Navy and DoD guidance.  In order to ensure fund integrity, transactions were monitored in accordance with FIAR and audit readiness requirements. 

-Budget Formulation, Justification, Presentation, Execution:  Supported current and future year requirements resulting in POM development, OPTAR management, and preparation of budget exhibits.

-Management Internal Control Program:  Monitored the compliance of Navy Programs.

-Facilities Management:  Coordinated the maintenance and repair of plant, property, and equipment and other base operating services.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As indicated in Section A above, funding is for general support and operating costs for Management Headquarter Activity (MHA) functions that support COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation as described in PE 0605865N Operational Test &amp; Evaluation Capability.

Beginning in Fiscal Year 2018, MHA labor and operating costs in support of 14 FTEs has been realigned from 0605865N Operational Test and Evaluation Capability into this newly established program element 0902498N Management Headquarters (Departmental Support Accounts) as a result of SECDEF and SECNAV direction to identify all MHA costs separately.

MHA Functions support more than 400 Programs and HQ support needs to include:
 

-Financial Management Systems:  Fund execution is accomplished through the use of Standard Accounting Budgeting Reporting System (SABRS), Standard Accounting and Reporting System - Field Level(STARS-FL), Defense Travel System (DTS), Wide Area WowrkFlow (WAWF), Electronic Business Suite (EB Suite), and Electronic Document Access (EDA) for current and prior year financial transactions.

-Financial Management Analysis: The mission, functions, and tasks of the command are met through funds allocated from the following appropriations: RDT&amp;E, OMN, APN, OPN, and DoD.  Funds are authorized, committed, obligated, and executed IAW Navy and DoD guidance.  In order to ensure fund integrity, transactions are monitored in accordance with FIAR and audit readiness requirements. 

-Budget Formulation, Justification, Presentation:  Supports current and future year requirements resulting in POM development, OPTAR management, and preparation of budget exhibits.

-Acquisition/Contracting:  Supports the acquisition of test and evaluation services and support requirements from various firm fixed price multiple award contracts.  Invoice payments are processed through the use of WAWF and Invoicing, Receipt, Acceptance and Property Transfer (iRAPT).

-Management Internal Control Program:  Monitors the compliance of Navy Programs.

-Facilities Management:  Coordinates the maintenance and repair of plant, property, and equipment and other base operating services.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to rapidly and with certainty: 1) exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) understand the disposition of friendly and adversarial forces, as well as uninvolved/neutral elements in the area of operations; 3) have access to target quality intelligence at the right time to conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries, and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

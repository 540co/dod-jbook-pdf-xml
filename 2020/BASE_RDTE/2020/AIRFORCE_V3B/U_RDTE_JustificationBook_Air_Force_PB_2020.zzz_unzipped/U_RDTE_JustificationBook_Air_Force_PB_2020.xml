                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020,  PE 0301017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), Project 675368, GSIN (Global Integrated Sensor Network, efforts were transferred to PE 1201017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), Project Project 675368, GSIN (Global Integrated Sensor Network, for more accurate classification of work.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.

The Nation's strategic C2 sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN developed and established a unified schema that integrates disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables existing radars and sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.

GSIN directly supports USSTRATCOM and other COCOMs and MAJCOM mission sets. GSIN meshes together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Repurposing these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. GSIN enables creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. GSIN also improves Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability and provides this data for the larger space order of battle capabilities. GSIN dramatically improves the ingestion of non-traditional, but readily available, non-US government and commercial data to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) catalog managed by the 18SPCC at Vandenberg AFB. GSIN addresses NORTHCOM/STRATCOM's signed Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) ST-0010 request for uninterrupted traditional and non-traditional sensor data integration and the Global Threat Characterization Assessment (GTCA) Operational Planning Team report. GSIN provides critical and unique data to the large AFSPC SSA data repositories to facilitate the large Space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) suite of capabilities/programs. Finally, GSIN provides Machine Learner and Data Analysis functions to optimize and operate situational awareness in the field.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver &lt;insert program name> weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F,0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0301025F, project 673280, GeoBase Development, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds development of the GeoBase Program.  A key initial component of GeoBase is the Common Installation Picture (CIP) which provides the foundation upon which subsequent GeoBase spirals will be built.  The CIP will be developed for active, Guard, and Reserve garrison and expeditionary installations to provide a single, interactive map of our installations.  Warfighters, commanders, planners, and support personnel alike will be afforded unprecedented situational awareness to accomplish their respective missions.  The functional mission sectors will be able to exploit GeoBase to achieve their objectives more effectively, their legacy data will be integrated with the CIP.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) conducts global operations in partnership with other combatant commands, services and U.S. government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the United States. USSTRATCOM is responsible for command of U.S. nuclear capabilities, space operations, global surveillance and reconnaissance, intelligence, communications, computers, global missile defense and combatting weapons of mass destruction. To enable completion
of these missions, it is recapitalizing the Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES). NPES is a Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff system for nuclear operations and fulfillment of Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) responsibilities. NPES supports national strategic deterrence by providing a host of NC2 execution activities as well as contingency and crisis action planning capabilities to selected joint and combatant command staffs. NPES is operated by USSTRATCOM and other specified users performing missions to deter and dissuade threats, and, when directed, defeat adversaries.

The NPES system has evolved from several single-purpose command and control systems over the past 30 years and has reached a point where it requires recapitalization to meet national and strategic objectives and to comply with future concepts of operation. Additionally, recapitalization is needed to improve cybersecurity, system effectiveness, and supportability. Recapitalization will also seek to lower the total cost of ownership and sustainment. The recapitalization
program will use proven/mature software engineering, technologies, and design tenets to provide a modern, secure, interoperable and reliable Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) software capability.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NPES weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F,
0605831F,0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) conducts global operations in partnership with other combatant commands, services and U.S. government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the United States.  USSTRATCOM is responsible for command of U.S. nuclear capabilities, space operations, global surveillance and reconnaissance, intelligence, communications, computers, global missile defense and combatting weapons of mass destruction.  To enable completion of these missions, it is recapitalizing the Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES).  NPES is a Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff system for nuclear operations and fulfillment of Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) responsibilities.  NPES supports national strategic deterrence by providing a host of NC2 execution activities as well as contingency and crisis action planning capabilities to selected joint and combatant command staffs.  NPES is operated by USSTRATCOM and other specified users performing missions to deter and dissuade threats, and, when directed, defeat adversaries. 
 
The NPES system has evolved from several single-purpose command and control systems over the past 30 years and has reached a point where it requires recapitalization to meet national and strategic objectives and to comply with future concepts of operation. Additionally, recapitalization is needed to improve cybersecurity, system effectiveness, and supportability. Recapitalization will also seek to lower the total cost of ownership and sustainment.  The recapitalization program will use proven/mature software engineering, technologies, and design tenets to provide a modern, secure, interoperable and reliable Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) software capability. NPES will exploit AFLCMC/HBC software factory economies of scale to enable developers to build and integrate software at the Top Secret level vice paying to build duplicate capabilities at other government or contractor facilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NPES weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F,0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Decision Support Service (DSS) directly supports the senior leader decision making calculus.  Numerous studies, reviews and practical experience identified the need to create a decision making aid. These identified needs culminated in an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that was validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  DSS will improve situational awareness, aggregate strategic-level information, provide a common visual display, be resilient, and mobile. Several attempts to provide a DSS-like capability has been attempted over the years.  These ad hoc attempts failed due to the lack of community buy-in and a structured acquisition methodology.  Today, DSS has complete community buy-in and folding it under AFLCMC ensure rigorous acquisition processes will be followed. The program will use the accelerated acquisition process known as Section 804.  USSTRATCOM is the logical home for DSS.  Additionally AFLCMC's Command and Control Division (HBC) has extensive expertise in developing software and visualization tools for over 30 years and is co-located with USSTRATCOM. DSS is supported by WHMO, OSD, NLCC, and CJCS.  The Service provider is the United States Air Force and the Functional Manager is Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DSS will develop, test, and field a decision support system capability for use from the combatant commander and above.  DSS will use agile development to rapidly prototype, develop software, and field the solutions. DSS will use existing government contract vehicles when advantageous or create development contracts that are negotiated and awarded in a competitive environment. This program will be using the Section 804 acquisitions process to accelerate delivery of a finished product. Section 804 outlines authority granted to DoD in the FY2016 National Defense Acquisitions Act to rapidly prototype/field capabilities distinct from the traditional DoD 5000 acquisition system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program, BA 07 PE 0301401F, project 67A051, Cross Domain Tactical OPIR Processing, is a new start.

Air Force Space and Cyber Non-Traditional Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) for Battlespace Awareness PE 0301401F - P-40A
Cross Domain Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR): Cross Domain Tactical OPIR Processing delivers a mechanism providing reach-back support for battlespace awareness functions and manages the timely transfer of newly developed tools to operational users.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>FY18 E-4B Recapitalization efforts are executed under PE0604288F, Project 646507, BA4</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The four (4) aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities permitting military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of conflict (nuclear and non-nuclear) or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). 

This program's developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment). Additionally, modifications may enhance the aircraft's operations center facilities, to include but not limited to those necessary for the Senior Leadership Command, Control and Communications System (SL3CS), National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC), Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) and other communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Funds may also be used to explore and develop modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements. This budget supports the following developmental modifications and studies/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment:

- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.

- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program replaces the currently installed Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Transmit system, which is no longer sustainable after over 35 years of operation. In order to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 requirements and ensure there is assured connectivity between civilian and military leadership and military forces during real world situations, this system must be replaced. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Control/Monitor group, a Power Amplifier/Coupler (PA/C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.

- The MUOS program upgrades the E-4B's Ultra-High Frequency Radio transmitters to be MUOS capable to meet E-4B Capability Development Document (CDD) and CJCSI 6251_01D requirements.  MUOS provides securable data and full duplex voice communications while simultaneously monitoring a second frequency.  The MUOS upgrade will provide interoperability with MUOS waveforms for voice and data communications and with other nuclear and national C2 centers and aircraft by replacing the legacy USC-42 UHF SATCOM radios with a MUOS capable radio.

- Survivable SHF will upgrade and replace portions of the E-4B's SHF system to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 and National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-51/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20 requirements and to ensure continued connectivity and interoperability as satellite and communications infrastructure evolves.  Expected modifications include, but are not limited to, component and sub-system upgrades and replacement of portions of the current SHF system that are obsolete or near end of service life. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-4B weapon system capability; furthermore, it may include support funding for emerging modification requirements to support PMA, A&amp;AS, equipment and other government cost.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-4B weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: The acquisition strategy for each specific modification differs based on the urgency of the requirement, definition of the capability, and technology readiness level of the components.  

Management Strategy:  Program management for all aircraft modifications is executed by the Commercial Derivative Aircraft Division at Tinker AFB.  The Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Presidential and Executive Airlift provides management oversight.

Contracting Strategy:  Contracting strategy differs for each individual modification, but normally includes an initial engineering study contract followed by a development contract.  Production installations and sustainment are typically accomplished with the E-4B Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Dem/Val will continue to execute funds from the MEECN System Improvements (MSI) Program 0303131F, Project 672832.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function. Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces. The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.

The MEECN portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments.

MSI is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to monitor and assess the performance of NC3 systems and develop recommendations for current and future strategic and tactical architectures, requirements, and issues based on available and emerging technologies. MSI is used to conduct technology testing; analyze technology strategies; conduct requirement trade space analysis, technology maturation and risk reduction efforts, and mission analysis; and build technology Roadmaps as proactive support to the NC3 community. MSI performs analysis, integration, and testing activities for the NC3 Weapon System.

NC3 Dem/Val is required for advanced concept development and prototyping of next generation NC3 systems. This program ensures a responsive design and development engineering infrastructure to address evolving Nuclear Deterrence Operations mission requirements, emerging issues and technology insertion/technology application on the NC3 Weapon System, future strategic systems/capability, and other common strategic areas where appropriate, and develop enhanced multi-use capabilities.  The NC3 Dem/Val Program will provide technology maturation and risk reduction activities to support the NC3 Weapon System (AN/USQ-225).  Activity will reduce life cycle costs, inform technology maturation &amp; risk reduction efforts, improve system performance, mitigate evolving threats, and ensure both viability and durability of the NC3 Weapon System.

Common Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc. 2) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. The intent of CVR Inc. 2 is to replace inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment by developing and producing a common VLF/LF receiver, capable of implementing an interoperable waveform, to integrate into current and future airborne and ground based platforms, improve system performance, and reduce supportability costs through commonality. The program will also lead the development of the Uniform MEECN Mode (UMM) waveform expected to be used by the United States Air Force and Navy.

Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces and Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS) and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).   Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc. 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments.

Global ASNT Inc. 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.

Global ASNT Increment 2 delivers a replacement Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities. Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Dem/Val, is an FY19 new start ($25.012M), to be executed in the MEECN System Improvements (MSI) line Program 0303131F, Project 672832. NC3 Dem/Val efforts will be continued in the MSI line in FY20 and beyond.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MEECN System Improvement (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to monitor and assess the performance of NC3 systems and develop recommendations for current and future strategic and tactical architectures, requirements, and issues based on available and emerging technologies. MSI is used to conduct technology testing; analyze technology strategies; conduct requirement trade space analysis, technology maturation and risk reduction efforts, and mission analysis; and build technology roadmaps as proactive support to the NC3 enterprise.  MSI performs analysis, integration, and testing activities for the NC3 Weapon System.

NC3 Dem/Val is required for advanced concept development and prototyping of next generation NC3 systems. This program ensures a responsive design and development engineering infrastructure to address evolving NDO mission requirements, emerging issues and technology insertion/technology application on the NC3 Weapon System, future strategic systems/capability, and other common strategic areas where appropriate, and develop enhanced multi-use capabilities.  The NC3 Dem/Val Program will provide technology maturation and risk reduction activities to support the NC3 Weapon System (AN/USQ-225).  Activity will reduce life cycle costs, inform technology maturation &amp; risk reduction efforts, improve system performance, mitigate evolving threats, and ensure both viability and durability of the NC3 Weapon System.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc. 2) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. The intent of CVR Inc. 2 is to replace inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment by developing and producing a common VLF/LF receiver, capable of implementing an interoperable waveform, to integrate into current and future airborne and ground based platforms, improve system performance, and reduce supportability costs through commonality. The program will also lead the development of the Uniform MEECN Mode (UMM) waveform expected to be used by the United States Air Force and Navy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces and Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS) and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews. 

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments.

Global ASNT Increment 2 delivers a replacement Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and High Frequency (HF) capabilities. Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: The HF Modernization program is designed to replace existing legacy High Frequency (HF) radios with a modernized HF radio on all Air Force (AF) aircraft that currently are equipped with HF radios (e.g., AN/ARC-190).  The current HF radios installed on AF aircraft have reached obsolescence and there is a compelling need to modernize the HF capabilities.  The replacement radio will have similar form and fit, but increased capability. The new radio needs to incorporate new technologies such as 3G/4G Automatic Link Establishment (ALE), wide band features that allow the radio to operate from 3 KHz up to 48 KHz channel spacing, and Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) features. The new HF radio should be software defined (SDR) to accommodate growth for newer technologies and embedded cryptographic options. 

The current AN/ARC-190 radios, that serve a majority of HF airborne needs, will approach end of life ~2025 and do not have current capabilities to be sustainable for future years. Current and future AF aircraft with validated requirements for HF radios will experience a shortage of HF radios starting in FY20. With the increased shortage of spares, as the current HF radios continue to fail, Air Traffic Control (ATC), Air Operation Centers (AOC), and other controlling agencies will lose the ability to communicate with aircraft. HF Modernization provides alternate means of communication when satellite communications are not available due to nature and man-made disruptions. It is essential that these airborne radios keep pace to guarantee interoperability or theater C2 will be degraded.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to, contract services and government costs. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver HF Modernization effort. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements, 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605812F,0605898F,0605833F.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303133F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) - Includes resources, manpower authorizations, necessary facilities and equipment required to perform INFOSEC research and development, to provide INFOSEC services, to procure INFOSEC products required to secure telecommunications and information systems when such products are separately procurable from host systems, and to provide INFOSEC maintenance and support. Also includes costs associated with the protection afforded to telecommunications and information systems which process sensitive data and efforts to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and the system.

The ISSP Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance, and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution /management systems (known as the Key Management Enterprise (KME)). ISSP delivers on rising national, DoD, and AF priorities to address cyber security threats and increasing war-fighter dependence on cyberspace. The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure, collect, process, store, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power in modern, high-tempo, full-spectrum operations. AF Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment protects information such as war-fighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness and ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the war-fighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or exceptionally grave damage to national security. 

The overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation war-fighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) mandates to address decertifications, new requirements, and end of life issues. NSA's first tenet calls for an AF KME that permits a totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU). This eliminates the current key vulnerability of compromise /interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key. NSA's second tenet requires an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable. This enables more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, lower life cycle costs, and ensured global information grid-compatibility. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort modernizes cryptographic devices protecting critical national security information across cyber domain operations. In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were also identified and have been replaced or are in the process of being replaced. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified by device and algorithm in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides this assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Infrastructure (KMI-See PE 0303140F, Project 67523, AF KMI for a full description).  This AF effort supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform to next-generation cryptographic capabilities.  It provides U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision making information in accordance with national and international policy/standards, the validated operational requirements of the warfighters, and the intelligence communities.  

The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure, transparent, network-centric capabilities across the cyber domain. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Technical Development (TD) conducts concept development and early systems engineering activities to analyze evolving threats and Communications Security (COMSEC) capability gaps across AF and DoD mission areas. Develops, plans and executes foundational technology demonstration efforts to inform COMSEC requirements, concept characterization and technical description (CCTD), and support cost estimates prior to Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for future cryptographic initiatives. Mitigates risk for thousands of AF and DoD users affected by algorithm security issues and ensures required security upgrades can be integrated into the AF and DoD enterprise. Works closely with NSA and other services to develop standards that increase security of communication and information products and facilitate efficient crypto and COMSEC enterprise management. Includes but is not limited to: Common Cryptologic Management Information Base (CC MIB), Advanced Cryptographic Capabilities Increment One (ACC Inc. 1), Cryptographic Modernization 2 (CM2), Trusted Systems Network (TSN)/Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM), Space Aligned Ground Equipment (SAGE), and MILSATCOM Crypto Mod (MCM). Space Aligned Ground Equipment (SAGE) addresses capability gaps by developing Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) to support modular cryptography, operating at higher data rates, incorporating enhanced system protective capabilities, and including tenants of the Warrior Construct. MILSATCOM Crypto Modernization (MCM) Initiative is comprised of the Protected Tactical SATCOM (PTS) and Evolved Strategic Satellite (ESS). The PTS Crypto Program will provide the cryptographic capabilities for Telemetry, Tracking, &amp; Commanding (TT&amp;C) links for the Protected Tactical SATCOM. This satellite system will provide worldwide, beyond line of sight, Anti-Jam (AJ), low probability of intercept communications to tactical warfighters in both benign and contested environments via space-based fully processed SATCOM payloads. The centerpiece of the PTS system will be a new, more resilient Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW), designed to mitigate the effects of advanced jamming in Anti-Access/Area Denial environments. The ESS Crypto Program will provide the cryptographic capabilities for the Mission Communications and TT&amp;C links for the ESS system. This satellite system will be a follow-on program to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite constellation providing survivable, global, secure, protected, and jam-resistant communications for high-priority military ground, sea and air assets.  ESS satellites will be interoperable with existing AEHF satellites and AEHF-compatible sea, air and ground SATCOM terminals.  ESS satellites will also extend the Enhanced Polar Satellite (EPS) systems missions as they operate in a highly elliptical orbit.</r2:Description>

The CM portfolio of component acquisition projects is executing using a variety of approaches that vary from an evolutionary acquisition strategy using spiral development (for new component development) to incremental improvement leveraging leading-edge, certified non-developmental items (for modernization). Contract type is selected for each of the individual projects based upon its acquisition approach and its unique technology risks. A mixture of fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts have been selected which maximize the best value for the Government.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Key Management Enterprise (AF KME) Program consists of multiple developments supporting the AF requirements/portion of the DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the AF Information Network and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.

The DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy EKMS. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man "out-of-the-loop" in the distribution of crypto key materials.

The AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KME Tier 3 architecture. This Research and Development effort includes system engineering, development and testing to successfully implement the AF KMI Last Mile architecture as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME). The AF KME Tier 3 is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KME Tier 3 capabilities include as part of the AF KME distribution, management, and loading of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the end cryptographic unit (ECU). It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrate other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KME Tier 3 is currently in the Development Phase. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

In parallel with AF KMI, DoD and the Services are addressing the need for a new generation of future KMI-aware ECUs that will be capable of direct interaction with the DoD KMI Enterprise, under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative  (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative).  In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. "Last mile" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Protection Risk Management (EPRM) is an automated risk management framework to assess and mitigate cyber and other threats to Air Force information technology and mission assets. This capability eliminates stove pipes and provides commanders with better situational awareness of vulnerabilities. Additionally, this capability promotes efficiency and sound resource allocation by enabling commanders to make better decisions when selecting risk reduction counter measures.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI) is a Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to standardize force structure data, making it visible, accessible, and understandable across the Department of Defense (DoD). This initiative is accomplished through each service's Organizational Server. The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) consumes data from various Air Force Authoritative Data Sources (ADSs), validates it, formats it in a consistent force structure data standard, and publishes it for consumption by programs of record that use force structure data. The AFOS is the ADS for Air Force Authorized Force Structure and provides critical unit, billet, crew platform, vehicle, and command relationship data within the Air Force to the Joint Staff (J8) for war and contingency planning, by providing visibility of the entire force structure as a function of time: past, present and future.

The AFOS produces consistent force structure data in the Global Force Management Information Exchange Model format that is well defined, centrally managed, and inter-operable as a standardized representation of the organization's hierarchy in all other programs of record that use force structure data. The end goal of the GFM-DI AFOS is to integrate the four force management processes (Assignment, Manpower &amp; Personnel, Readiness, and Allocation), and ensure the data is available to meet the needs of all users, systems and functions.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the GFM-DI system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program will utilize an evolutionary acquisition strategy resulting in the migration to a Joint Information Environment (JIE)-compliant platform, replacement of system Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) components with newer, more capable elements, and additional software releases to implement additional requirements. 

The anticipated contract structure will be Firm-Fixed Price contract.

The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) PMO will utilize a mix of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Interface Requirement Agreements with AFOS stakeholders and support agencies as part of its management strategy. SLAs will be developed with the Lead Developmental Test Organization and the Capabilities Integration Environment at Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex. The AFOS PMO also maintains Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with several AFOS input and output systems, including Manpower Programming &amp; Execution Systems,  Air Force Directory Services, Air Force Equipment Management System, and Force Structure Data Management.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, PE 0304115F, Multi Domain Command and Control (MDC2), Project Number 673380, Multi Domain Command and Control (MDC2), transferred from PE 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 674596, AOC WS Modifications, in order to improve transparency of development programs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2019, Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2) Development was a new start in PE 0207410F, AOC, Project Number 674596, AOC WS Mods.

Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2) is a multi-node concept which connects existing DevOps environments in order to achieve MDC2 objectives. It serves as a warfighter-centric focal point for USAF-organic rapid software development, experimentation, testing, and operationalization of MDC2 capabilities. It will explore advanced technology and leverage agile acquisition to rapidly operationalize MDC2 tools and capabilities. Experimentation to shape the future MDC2 network capability through data virtualization. The ShadowNet is a multi-node concept unifying software development with operators in order to achieve MDC2 objectives. It serves as a warfighter-centric focal point for USAF, Joint and coalition by rapidly developing capability and testing future multi-domain concepts.

In FY 2020, the Air Force will develop a MDC2 capability to provide warfighters and support elements across all services and domains a common C2 platform from which disparate data sources may be leveraged and cross-domain effects may be synchronized. This common platform expands on the Kessel Run Air Operations Center platform and is undergirded by the creation of an enterprise data lake and an experimentation campaign focused on testing and developing enterprise solutions for the common enablers of data, network, and link capability.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MDC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program provides signals intelligence (SIGINT) development efforts for all USAF airborne platforms. The funds in this Program are distributed among all Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) in order to build a total SIGINT capability. As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent and emerging warfighter needs. This program will participate in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of international and Air Force standards (to include North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Modernization efforts include sensors for the platforms and where appropriate, their interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS). This approach supports a synergistic development effort providing a true Air Force-wide capability.

This enterprise will use the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) for planning and decision-making and, in turn, employ open architecture standards whenever possible to allow maximum ease of future upgrades and system interoperability. The primary goal of the ASE is to produce an architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF. Funds in any project may be used to fund initiatives in other projects within this Program at the discretion of the SCWG.
Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components. Through extensive utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based solutions to field needed capabilities, it also incurs a need for continuous identification of suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and integration efforts consistent with the COTS technology cycle.  These efforts provide required engineering for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations integrated into the various baseline modifications.  These funds will be split between the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL programs.  Funding reflects the SCWG priorities and the accomplishment of other Airborne SIGINT Enterprise initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, program management administration and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) and other sensors and their associated air and ground components that will be used on/by more than one platform.  The common development SIGINT project also supports development of new sensors capabilities, normalization of quick reaction capabilities, and develops replacement components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).  New capabilities are developed by separate efforts. This project also supports the development of efforts common to the Airborne SIGINT Enterprise Program overall to include, but not limited to: the Air Force SIGINT Architecture maintenance, modeling and simulation efforts, and NATO SIGINT efforts.

Development supports ASIP system upgrades and potential follow-on sensors. The ASIP sensor is designed to be a common SIGINT system, allowing for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system. Follow-on objectives include but are not limited to use of open architecture concepts and rapid integration of new signals of interests.

Capability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP sensor through individual development efforts to exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SCWG.  This project provides the warfighter near term increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Compatibility improvements will be inserted into the ASIP through individual development efforts to exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the USAF SCWG. Sensors will be integrated and tested on the various platforms as funding permits.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SIGINT sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>COMPASS BRIGHT develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions advanced Air Force specific SIGINT capabilities against emerging and future target signals of interest.  This program pursues SIGINT technologies for program transition, to include Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Audio, Analytics, Special Signals of Interest, and Radio Frequency Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT).  The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to develop technologies for application in SIGINT and MASINT systems or subsystems. Acquisition and production of these developed technologies will occur within the appropriate platform programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process, whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the laboratories, platforms, and other government agencies, to select those projects that are most promising.

Operational Reconnaissance (Ops Recce) is part of the initiative to improve overall USAF intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability through development and use of sensor data from non-ISR platforms and innovative use of sensors.  This program pursues Ops Recce capabilities for transition through development, testing, demonstration and implementation efforts across all platforms.  The Ops Recce program objective is to provide increased battlespace awareness through the use of sensors/platforms to achieve effects beyond what those sensor/platforms were originally designed.   

The program office authority extends to accomplishment of out-of-cycle, nontraditional SIGINT (NTISR) efforts.  These tasks may be filtered through the SIGINT Capability Working Group (SCWG) outside the normal vetting process to expedite acquisition of high-end capabilities for the warfighter.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F,0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To preserve Air Force and DoD military advantage from commercial and economic risk, the Office of Commercial Economic Analysis (OCEA) produces in-depth analytical assessments and advanced risk mitigation strategies based on commercially available industry, market, and economic information.  These assessments and strategies support the decision making efforts of Service, Department of Defense, and Whole of Government to protect National Security Innovation Base equities and sustain the U.S. competitive advantage.  

The funding request provides for an enterprise analytic platform providing a technical prototype which will aggregate risk data and produce mitigation strategies and impact analytic products, i.e. mature big data architecture, higher domain connectivity, continuous assessment capability and integrate external applications.  The funding also supports continuous assessment of the commercially available information to ensure it is accurate, current, and relevant.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $.319 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Command and Control (C2) Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) funds operational development necessary to acquire and modify segments of Air Force's (AF) C2 capabilities and services. Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies. These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems. Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013). These activities include C2AOS-C2IS needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012).

Applications Development: C2AOS-C2IS creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest. C2AOS-C2IS also develops and matures net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions. These applications include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); the remainder of the CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality; services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a JC2 Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.

Unit Level: Command and Control, Incident Management, Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA; formerly Unit Command and Control [UC2]) funds develop and integrate C2IMERA as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support a wing commander's ability to track base level resources, incident management, and provide a real time Common Operating Picture. All in all enabling a commander to have total situational awareness during peace and wartime operations. C2IMERA operations software systems addresses needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD), and AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, requirements documents. C2IMERA is utilizing Agile Software Development and Operations (DevOps) methodology by directly soliciting user feedback for improvements to the software. C2IMERA is fielded to Wing Operations Centers (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Centers (MOC), the Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), Crisis Action Teams (CAT), and many other work-centers across multiple MAJCOMs with plans to expand for use as an AF wide application.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Applications Development and Unit Level capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY 2020, Applications Development (C2AOS-C2IS) will be focused on Agile Software Development and Operations (DevOps) to more quickly retire TBMCS FL and provide needed capability for inclusion in the Air Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System Modifications effort. Additionally in FY 2020, this effort will investigate and develop a solution to address joint partner and non-AOC usage of C2AOS-C2IS in the Agile DevOps framework.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Command and Control, Incident Management, Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA; formerly Unit Command and Control [UC2]) funds are used to develop and integrate C2IMERA as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support a wing commander's ability to track base level resources, incident management, and a real time Common Operating Picture, enabling a commander to have total situational awareness during peace and wartime operations. C2IMERA operations software systems addresses needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD), and AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, requirements documents. C2IMERA is utilizing Agile DevOps methodology by directly soliciting user feedback for improvements to the software. C2IMERA is fielded to Wing Operations Centers (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Centers (MOC), the Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), Crisis Action Teams (CAT), and many other work-centers across multiple MAJCOMs with plans to expand for use as an AF wide application.

In FY 2020, C2IMERA core development activities will be to add functions that improve user experience and performance, provide additional interfaces, Information Assurance (IA) improvements and solving test deficiencies.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C2IMERA capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. Currently, the Combatant Command (CCMD) Intelligence Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO) is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community (IC) users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. This minority stake and the physical and organizational separation of CCMD users limits their ability to influence the development and delivery of services, or results in poorly sustained one-off, vice enduring enterprise-wide, solutions. Beginning in late 2014, the CCMDs requested the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and the Joint Staff address longstanding gaps in their intelligence IT capabilities to support planning and operations. In response, OUSD(I) and Joint Staff/J2 sponsored an effort to document the required capabilities and chronic shortfalls, and to validate these requirements through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The initial Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) for the Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCIIT) Enterprise was completed in February 2016, and an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) was approved by the JROC in September 2016. In November 2016, USD(I) requested the Secretary of the Air Force, Administrative Assistant (SAF/AA) establish a Provisional Program Activity Office (PPAO) for CCIIT, to advocate for materiel and non-materiel solutions for these validated requirements. Through FY2017, the CCIIT PPAO has actively engaged with the CCMDs and service providers throughout DoD and the IC to refine requirements, identify potential solutions, produce an integrated baseline enterprise architecture, and align and integrate capabilities across the enterprise critical to the warfighter. As of August 2018, CCIIT PPAO, transitioned to a fully operational, enduring Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO) assisting OUSD(I); the new moniker is Combatant Command (CCMD) Intelligence- Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO).

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $0.498 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. Currently, the Combatant Command (CCMD) Intelligence Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO) is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community (IC) users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. This minority stake and the physical and organizational separation of CCMD users limits their ability to influence the development and delivery of services, or results in poorly sustained one-off, vice enduring enterprise-wide, solutions. Beginning in late 2014, the CCMDs requested the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and the Joint Staff address longstanding gaps in their intelligence IT capabilities to support planning and operations. In response, OUSD(I) and Joint Staff/J2 sponsored an effort to document the required capabilities and chronic shortfalls, and to validate these requirements through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The initial Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) for the Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCIIT) Enterprise was completed in February 2016, and an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) was approved by the JROC in September 2016. In November 2016, USD(I) requested the Secretary of the Air Force, Administrative Assistant (SAF/AA) establish a Provisional Program Activity Office (PPAO) for CCIIT, to advocate for materiel and non-materiel solutions for these validated requirements. Through FY2017, the CCIIT PPAO has actively engaged with the CCMDs and service providers throughout DoD and the IC to refine requirements, identify potential solutions, produce an integrated baseline enterprise architecture, and align and integrate capabilities across the enterprise critical to the warfighter.  As of August 2018, CCIIT PPAO, transitioned to a fully operational, enduring Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO) assisting OUSD(I); the new moniker is Combatant Command (CCMD) Intelligence- Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. Currently, the Combatant Command (CCMD) Intelligence Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO) is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community (IC) users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. This minority stake and the physical and organizational separation of CCMD users limits their ability to influence the development and delivery of services, or results in poorly sustained one-off, vice enduring enterprise-wide, solutions. Beginning in late 2014, the CCMDs requested the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and the Joint Staff address longstanding gaps in their intelligence IT capabilities to support planning and operations. In response, OUSD(I) and Joint Staff/J2 sponsored an effort to document the required capabilities and chronic shortfalls, and to validate these requirements through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The initial Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) for the Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCIIT) Enterprise was completed in February 2016, and an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) was approved by the JROC in September 2016. In November 2016, USD(I) requested the Secretary of the Air Force, Administrative Assistant (SAF/AA) establish a Provisional Program Activity Office (PPAO) for CCIIT, to advocate for materiel and non-materiel solutions for these validated requirements. Through FY2017, the CCIIT PPAO has actively engaged with the CCMDs and service providers throughout DoD and the IC to refine requirements, identify potential solutions, produce an integrated baseline enterprise architecture, and align and integrate capabilities across the enterprise critical to the warfighter. As of August 2018, CCIIT PPAO, transitioned to a fully operational, enduring Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO) assisting OUSD(I); the new moniker is Combatant Command (CCMD) Intelligence- Enterprise Management Support Office (EMSO).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program, BA 7, PE 0305022F, project 675306, Kill Chain Automation, is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) AF ISR must adapt large data sets and condition it into mission sets, allowing personnel to discover, manage, and analyze data and transform it into living intelligence. Kill Chain Automation applies new methodologies; advances automation and machine learning; ensures data is accessible, agreeable, and interoperable; and delivers decision advantage.

(U//FOUO) Algorithmic Warfare encompasses efforts to develop, employ, or field artificial intelligence, automation, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms. This critical shift to the digital age will transition ISR analysis from the "what" to the "why" of analysis via human-machine teaming. Algorithmic Warfare can provide world-class ISR support to Joint Operations at the scale and speed required in modern warfare against our adversaries. 

(U//FOUO) Algorithmic Warfare reshapes current sense, identify, attribute, share (SIAS, previously known as PED - processing, exploitation, and dissemination) models because the current models will be unsustainable and ineffective in developing ISR digital solutions to find efficiencies and thrive in a complex operating environment. This funding is a first step to address ISR analysts' struggles with data overload; they currently spend 80 percent of their time searching for data and 20 percent of their time making sense of the information. 

(U) Supports National Defense Strategy priority of operating at the "speed of relevance."

(U) Supports Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element funds the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Aerospace Management Systems Division (AMSD), the designated Air Force (AF) Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Navigation Safety Center of Excellence (COE).  The COE provides highly specialized analysis, assessment and performance monitoring expertise to Headquarters Air Force, AF major commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices regarding CNS/ATM system technical functions and performance standards for safe and efficient operations in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 30 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS/ATM technical expertise. 

This funding enables the AMSD to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums and U.S. and International civil aviation standards bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) and others, responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for safe and efficient operations in worldwide airspace.  Division personnel analyze civil standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DoD) interests.  CNS/ATM COE experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria established by DoD and these standards bodies and document them in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel to develop strategies for implementing CNS/ATM requirements on AF weapon systems and tailor the GPMs to each platform's unique avionics architecture and operational mission.  Once CNS/ATM component integration and testing is completed, COE personnel validate platform CNS/ATM performance against the standards necessary to operate in worldwide civil airspace.  This assessment is submitted to the aircraft program office and becomes part of their Airworthiness certification package.  

The program office provides technical analysis and assessments of CNS/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment throughout the lifecycle of aircraft platforms.  Efforts include and are not limited to performance assessment, test support, performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and the development and assessment of CNS/ATM capabilities for unmanned platforms such as location-specific Ground Based Detect and Avoid radar and airspace (GBDAA) characterization.

The program office office administers the electronic DoD Avionics Equipment Catalog (iGATM) through an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle that enables centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment and manages other contracts offering technical engineering services to aircraft platform program offices.  Technical engineering services may include and is not limited to performance monitoring, interoperability testing, cybersecurity assessments, and development and assessment of CNS/ATM capabilities for unmanned platforms such as location-specific GBDAA characterization.   These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DoD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.

The program office performs periodic and event driven audits required by civil aviation assurance standards on processes used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) to DoD users. This electronic navigation database, developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains critical safety of flight information used by all DoD flight crews to fly instrument flight rules procedures worldwide.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CNS/ATM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, sustain, and modernize Air Force Weather Service (AFWS) capabilities in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) lines of effort.  To improve readiness for a more lethal force, AFWS provides timely, accurate, resilient and relevant environmental information, to include space and terrestrial weather, for global battlespace situational awareness for Air Force (AF), Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), combatant commands, and other government agencies.  AFWS capabilities at home station and deployed provide critical support to the full spectrum of air and space combat operations.  AFWS development enhances the lethality, effectiveness, and survivability of AF weapon systems and precision munitions by modernizing capability and seeking the military advantage to accurately predict friendly and foe environmental impacts to optimize mission execution and planning, targeting, weaponeering, battle damage assessment and space systems operations.  To strengthen alliances and partnerships, AFWS development efforts integrate DoD, government agency, and commercial and international partner environmental data with AFWS information system equipment for processing, storing, exploiting and disseminating multi-domain weather information for analysis, forecasting, mission integration and greater interoperability.  Funding for AFWS development also ensures greater performance and affordability through improvements to architecture and system efficiency, cybersecurity, C4ISR integration, migration to cloud computing, and expanding agile software development, delivery and integration practices.  

AFWS aligns activities under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Of these four capability areas, two (Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination and Weather Forecasting) are addressed by APPN 3600, BA 07, PE 0305111F, Project 672738 - Weather Service. 
 
1. Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides command and control and mission planning integration; centralized, cybersecure weather web service capability; large-scale data ingest, processing, and warfighter product generation and visualization;  Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration for software development and deployment; global, regional, and mission execution forecasts; specific, mission-tailored weather data on demand; and weapon system interoperability which shortens the Combatant Commander kill chain through machine to machine interfaces.  The Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination capability area includes activities for Weather Data Analysis and its follow-on increment, Weather Data Analysis Increment 5 (WDA and WDA-Inc 5). 

2. Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission planning, rehearsal, and execution with an emphasis on clouds, theater scale weather, aerosol/chemical constituents, and space environment characterization. Weather Forecasting includes activities for Numerical Weather Modeling (NWM); Weather Services - Live, Virtual, Constructive (WS-LVC), and Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS). 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Weather Services capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F, 0605833F, 1206392F, and 1206398F.

Activities include research and analysis to support current program planning. Management Service costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and Advisory and Assistance Service (A&amp;AS).

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ATCALS development funding currently focuses on Future Air Traffic Control (ATC) Technologies within the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System (ATS) and Deployable Radar Approach Control (DRAPCON) programs as described below.

NextGen ATS. This is the United States initiative for the transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) over the next 20-30 years to enhance safety, security, efficiency, affordability and capacity, meeting the requirements of all users of the NAS. This interagency effort is designed to identify the warfighter's emerging airspace needs, analyze technologies, formulate requirements and positions, and advise DoD aviation and air traffic communities in order to enable safe and efficient military flight operations in a changing global airspace. Future ATC Technology will be built on key elements from the NextGen ATS projects, leveraging those systems and studies to further advance ATC systems under development. As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned). These efforts will involve aircraft avionics as well as fixed based and deployable air traffic control and landing systems. FY20 efforts will continue to research and develop new technologies in the areas of aircraft launch and recovery, airspace interoperability, and optimization of flight capability, as well as continue enabling Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) access to the NAS, develop a NextGen ATS DoD Strategic Roadmap, add new capabilities to Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) software, and outline DoD and Air Force equities and requirements via in-depth analysis of FAA NextGen ATS programs and timelines. Portfolio analysis will be captured in DoD NextGen ATS charters to guide Services through a broad and complex NextGen ATS environment. To minimize integration costs, the AF will work across the DoD to adopt a common framework with practical guidelines to evaluate the validity of NextGen ATS initiatives with the Air Force's mission. These efforts support the development of operational strategies that realize the achievement of valid NextGen ATS initiatives in concert with acquisition strategies in integrated avionics advances for focus areas such as Aircraft Launch and Recovery for both fixed and expeditionary operations, Airspace Interoperability, Optimized Flight Capability, and any DoD/USAF or civil US and International Mandates. FY20 tasks will also continue NextGen ATS strategic planning efforts, the conduct of service operational test and evaluation as required, and evaluation of new civil air traffic control and landing system technologies that may have military utility to include an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Tower System technology. In total, these efforts will focus on enabling DoD aircraft to take advantage of NextGen ATS envisioned efficiencies, developing policies/procedures to reduce costs while ensuring airspace access, seamlessly integrating UASs into the NAS and international airspaces, improving the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determining future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhancing flight safety.

Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 50 year old Air National Guard (ANG) AN/MPN-14K and Active Duty (AD) AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar and Operations Shelter subsystems with state-of-the-art digital systems.  Due to diminishing manufacturing sources, modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective.  On average, due to systemic equipment failures, no more than four of the existing 14 systems are deployable at any given time and none are fully mission capable.  Three of these systems are currently deployed.  Two of which are at a single location (one for spare parts).  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance/sequencing, air traffic control communications, automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations, and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe and secure communication capabilities (a deferred key system attribute).  D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a fixed base or deployable Instrument Landing System, a fixed or mobile control tower, and a fixed or mobile Tactical Air Navigation system to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  D-RAPCON will support the full range of tactical military, worldwide humanitarian, and domestic disaster relief operations.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) extends out 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) will increase from 120 nm to 200 nm.  The D-RAPCON Capability Development Document was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council on 8 Feb 11.  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the ATCALS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ATCALS is a basket program element with multiple programs in various stages of acquisition which provide the air traffic control infrastructure to support peacetime and wartime missions.  The current acquisition strategy is focused on replacing 1960/70s era deployable and fixed based equipment with mature off-the-shelf technology with remote maintenance capability while also looking to the future under the NextGen ATS initiative.

Current contracting efforts include D-RAPCON development, NextGen ATS planning and implementation, and conduct of an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower technology.  The contracting strategy for D-RAPCON development is based on award of a competitive fixed price incentive firm contract emphasizing off-the-shelf technology and maximizing the use of non-developmental items. The contract includes engineering, manufacturing, and development and test with follow-on production options.  NextGen ATS Enterprise Architecture Implementation Tasks, Infill radar certification, and ATC Management of UASs are being executed via Military Inter-Departmental Purchase Requests, and Project Orders with various organizations (FAA, MITRE, Army, Air Force Research Laboratory, and Air Force Flight Standards Agency).  The Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower EOA contract award was a full and open competition using Other Transaction Authority procedures.        

The Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) Digital is the PEO for ATCALS and is also the delegated milestone decision authority.  Program management, contracts, logistics, and financial management support is provided by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Aerospace Management Systems Division (AFLCMC/HBA) which is aligned under PEO/Digital.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets assure warfighters' weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production. Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, BQM-167A Subscale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized Target Payload Subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve aerial targets and target control capabilities to meet current and future threats. Air Force is the Executive Agent for full scale aerial targets.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Aerial Targets weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets, Subscale Aerial Targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) assure the effectiveness and currency of warfighter weapon systems to combat real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a reusable jet-powered target aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. 

Electronic Attack (EA) payload upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales and full-scales to realistically emulate current and emerging foreign threat systems in support of weapons testing.  

TCS provides a myriad of sub-systems that, together, deliver the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full-scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, and the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&amp;E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service test and evaluation (T&amp;E) demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This BPAC is an administrative continuation of BPAC 675366: QF-16, and encompasses the same efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets ensure warfighters' weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15 aircraft, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets ensure warfighters' weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15 and other aircraft.  Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) conducts specialized investigative activities and force protection support for Air Force (AF) commanders worldwide. This assists AF commanders in protecting their people and resources. AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations
for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information. The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems. Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute
those who do. While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology. The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD.
In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems. Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical
countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions. The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>These funds will support development of a suite of specialized law enforcement and counterintelligence restricted tools needed to exploit cyberspace, digital media storage and mobile audio/visual/data communications for the collection of evidence against a wide variety of serious offenses.  They will develop next generation Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) to defend against emerging foreign technical intelligence capabilities targeting sensitive protected information for exploitation.  The concerted efforts of criminal, terrorist and foreign intelligence elements to evade law enforcement and compromise protected systems, all while remaining undetected using the latest technical advances available, require persistent development of tools to defeat their efforts.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market Research is accomplished jointly within the DoD, Counterintelligence, and Law Enforcement communities with the various government laboratories and major  contractors to identify locations with the ability to develop investigative tools unique to our mission needs. These technologies, capabilities, and limitations of current and future investigative tools is sometimes highly sensitive or classified. Market Research also allows inter-agency coordination and deconfliction to occur,
reducing or eliminating duplicitous development efforts. Annually, stakeholders meet to discuss initiatives, challenges and organizational goals to coordinate or consolidate requirements to increase efficiency. Once Market Research and any applicable coordination/deconfliction is completed, acquisition channels are analyzed and selected based on the ability to meet operational and technical security requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Open Skies Treaty permits unarmed overflight of the sovereign territory of 34 signatory nations. The Treaty enhances mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information through aerial imaging on military forces and activities of concern. Open Skies is one of the most wide-ranging international arms control efforts to date to promote openness and transparency in military forces and activities.

The Department of Defense is responsible for oversight, implementation of, and compliance with, arms control agreements, including the Open Skies Treaty. The United States Air Force has a requirement to execute missions under the Open Skies Treaty and utilizes two OC-135B aircraft as the observation aircraft. All roles and responsibilities are called out in Presidential Policy Directive 15, "Implementation of the Treaty on Open Skies,” Mar 1, 2012. The OC-135B fleet has experienced decreasing mission reliability due to age, difficulties with out-of-production parts, and increased operating costs.  Open Skies missions averaged a 65% mission completion rate over the ten-year period from 2007 to 2017 with leading non-mission capable drivers being the engines, fuel system, landing gear, generators, and airframe. Additionally, the OC-135B aircraft's 6,500 km range is insufficient to fully execute mission options within the 96-hour in-country Treaty observation time constraint permitted under Treaty.

The Department of Defense, motivated by operational limitations of the OC-135B experienced during Open Skies missions combined with declining mission capability, prompted program officials to request a Capabilities-Based Assessment in July 2015 to study aircraft issues. The effort which completed in June 2016 indicated that key requirements within the 1992 Open Skies Operational Requirements Document were no longer current, and that the OC-135B had known capability performance gaps in range and mission completion.

In October 2016, the Air Force secured permission to develop a Doctrine, Organization, Training, materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy Change Recommendation for the Open Skies Treaty Aircraft. The process used a multi-disciplinary High Performance Team to create and validate a series of required capabilities for an Open Skies aircraft, evaluate aircraft that could satisfy the required capabilities, and then consider each of the Doctrine, Organization, Training, materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy elements as part of a recommended solution. The effort accomplished two main purposes. First, it updated operational requirement and replaced the 1992 Operational Requirements Document to reflect both operational experience and expected Open Skies program needs for the foreseeable future. Second, it recommend an Air Force solution that best satisfied required capabilities within existing materiel solutions. The Joint Capabilities Board adopted the Air Force recommendation directed acquisition of two small airliner class aircraft for the Open Skies Treaty mission to be acquired in a method consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and other applicable guidance, training using existing contractor training facilities, equipment, and curriculum, and a maintenance concept with military personnel performing unit-level maintenance actions with contractor support for parts supply, and supply chain management, performed under a Low Utilization Maintenance Program.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) develops future technologies capable of thwarting advanced, hostile force technical capabilities.  The technologies will provide secure environments for austere mission planning locations and theater commander centers, and will collect information for CI operations in support of DoD and AF requirements.

Cyber CI enables the Air Force Office of Special Investigations to detect and deter covert activities conducted by Foreign Intelligence Entities seeking to compromise classified or sensitive information in cyberspace. The technologies provided will provide state of the art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against sensitive and classified AF and DoD information and activities.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY2020 Integrated Broadcast Services (IBS) efforts funded in PE1203179F in FY2018 and FY2019, transferred to PE0305179F due to realignment of IBS to Major Force Program 03, Intelligence and Communication.

The IBS fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination
of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force
protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

IBS is comprised of the following:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF (Ultra High Frequency) satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a Military Standard (MIL-STD)
Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal
(JTT).
- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant
Commanders (COCOMs), all built to validated warfighter requirements.
-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users.
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast. Additionally, the TIN will
receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB.

This PE funds:
- Development/upgrades of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF)
This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver IBS weapon system capability. The use of such program
funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F,
and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The U-2S Dragon Lady platform is a high-demand/low-density aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art sensor and data link systems providing mission essential Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) to the Combatant Commands, Joint and Combined forces, and the IC community in peacetime and wartime. The program supports core missions such as Sensitive Reconnaissance Operations (outlined in CJCSI 3250.01) in addition to other missions that include execution of CCMD OPLANs and CONPLANs, Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Response (HADR), Counter-Insurgency (COIN) operations and third-party treaty verification/monitoring via the OLIVE HARVEST mission. 

The Air Force continues to invest and modernize the U-2 program in the 2020 President's Budget by addressing reliability, maintainability, supportability, diminishing manufacturing sources/ material shortages (DMS/MS), flight test, safety issues, and integration of capability development activities in support of the broader ISR portfolio. RDT&amp;E efforts will address sustainment, modification, and modernization of sensors and associated mission equipment, and focus on integrating/expanding platform capabilities within the larger ISR portfolio; these efforts include (but are not limited to) ASARS 2B/C, avionics and navigation tech refresh, mission planning software and infrastructure upgrades, modernization of aircraft data links, next generation SIGINT, and developing a quick reaction capability (QRC), enabling improved collection against emerging threats and capabilities.  

Additionally, the U-2 program will continue to prioritize emergent and/or experimental RDT&amp;E efforts designed to mitigate the rapidly evolving combat environment (e.g. electromagnetic requirements) in order to maintain safety and operational relevance through current and future U-2 operating locations. 

Currently, the U-2 Program provides funding for an Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) acquisition effort. This effort will design, fabricate, integrate, and demonstrate system capability enhancements for a high altitude deep look SAR system. This mitigates a Diminishing Manufacturing Supply and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issue with the current U-2 SAR sensor.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>FY19 will continue to support payload sustainment and/or enhancement activities such as, but not limited to, ASARS development, integration and test, defensive systems, datalinks, avionics technical refresh, SIGINT and multi-spectral sensor technical refresh, advanced and agile payloads, Optical Bar Camera technical refresh, sensor range improvements, and associated ground support equipment.

Counters emergent threats in the low band spectrum for detection, display and defeat by the AN/ALQ-221 Low Band (LB) subsystem in order to allow U-2 flight ops in moderately contested environments.
Requirements will be met with two system modifications: an Advanced Threat Systems modification and a Continuous Power wave Amplifier (CWPA) modification. 
 
This is the development work for follow on FY19 procurement of 15 kits + spares.  Additional information is available via classified means.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project was an Air Force led technology and concept development to demonstrate the ability for a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to stay airborne in the medium altitude structure for a multiple day duration mission with a minimum of 1,000 pounds payload capacity of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor systems.  The MAGIC concept was initiated by OSD/DDR&amp;E in FY 2010 in response to the Combatant Commanders ranking this type of initiative as the highest priority for a Joint Concept and Technology Demonstration (JCTD).  In FY 2011, the Air Force accepted this initiative as the sponsor and MAGIC was subsequently removed from consideration as a JCTD and transitioned into the Air Force as a developmental project.

The MAGIC project was intended to provide the USAF with data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a multiple day duration at medium altitude flight.  The objectives laid out in the JCTD competition and selection of Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA for the long endurance demonstration was managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG).

In FY 2010, OSD/DDR&amp;E (now ASD/R&amp;E) provided $5M of initial funding to AFRL to initiate the MAGIC project.  In FY 2011, ASD/R&amp;E provided an additional $5M to keep the MAGIC project development moving forward.  The Air Force provided $10M of FY 2011. Congressional Adds of $19M in FY 2012, $50M in FY 2013 and $20M in FY 2015, provided the program manager with the funding for the continuation of the Orion RPA development and initiation of the three phase flight testing series. Congressional adds of $5M in FY 2016, $50M in FY 2017 and $40M in FY 2018, continues the Orion Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) spiral development of a long endurance UAS that meets airworthiness and cybersecurity requirements, and provides a minimum interoperability and mission capability.

Orion RPA flight test series and demonstrations were accomplished at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, CA between August 2013 and March 2015.  The objectives to test/demonstrate basic air vehicle performance, expansion of the flight characteristic envelope and a multiple day sortie and integration of a nominal sensor payload, were successfully accomplished on the prototype (Block 0) Orion RPA in a controlled environment, non-representative of an operational setting. Subsequent development efforts concentrated on the validation of the Orion RPA system requirements and concept design/specifications for a follow-on air vehicle (Block 1) capable of operational deployment in the event that the Air Force chooses the Orion RPA as a quick reaction capable system for a theater of operation or a program of record.  Currently, there is no validated requirement for the Orion RPA.

A Congressional Add of $15M in FY 2019 completes flight software development, air vehicle system and ground test and begins performance characterization flight test.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>There is currently no validated requirement for the Orion RPA.  The concept for the Air Force to develop a long endurance, persistent ISR capability for the Combatant Commanders was an outgrowth of a JCTD started in FY 2010.  Previous development efforts included: completion of studies analysis, development of a prototype air vehicle (Block 0), bench testing of engines and other aircraft components, ground continuity testing of select avionics, flight controls, and engine components, slow and high speed ground taxiing and a full flight series testing of the Orion RPA capabilities to include a multiple day, long duration flight demonstration.  Starting with a portion of the FY 2015 funds, Congressional adds have continued hardware and software engineering and development efforts, while working towards operational airworthiness and cybersecurity standards, and mission requirements for a deployable air vehicle (Block 1).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY21 funds/activities for Agile ISR, Next-Generation Sensors and Sensors Open System Architecture will be in their own BPAC in order to provide greater visibility and transparency into these activities. These transferred efforts (SOSA, Next-Generation Sensors and Agile ISR) will not be new starts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of Airborne Reconnaissance System (ARS) Program is to develop, mature, demonstrate, and rapidly transition next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (active and passive systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities). It provides for modeling/simulation, training and systems engineering. This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) efforts are set by the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities Working Group (GCWG), for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities within the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and ASI efforts. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS 2B efforts include, but are not limited to, development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 
This activity also funds Sensors Open Systems Architecture (SOSA), which coordinates the development of advanced technologies open architecture development for sensor modalities such as RADAR, SIGINT, EW, communications and EO/IR in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned.  Funding in this activity also supports Detection Removal and Characterization Operation (DRACO) and Agile ISR, to develop a robust image quality improvement capability for airborne synthetic aperture radar products supporting multiple platforms at high, medium, and low altitudes. Additionally, funding covers GCWG Secretariat to manage GCWG planning, processes, and establish an Air Force GEOINT architecture. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Airborne Reconnaissance Systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the Imaging and Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) / Agile ISR is to develop, mature, demonstrate, and rapidly transition next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (active and passive systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).

Developmental efforts pursued include but are not limited to: Radar, Electro-Optical/Infrared, hyperspectral imagery (HSI), Lidar/Ladar, and other technologies to improve measurement and signature intelligence, polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indicator (GMTI), maritime search/track, foliage penetration, nuclear event detection, and other modalities; increased geolocation accuracy; increased dismount detection capability; advanced sensor data correlation; automated target detection; network centric warfare; and other ISR and associated planning and direction; collection; processing and exploitation; analysis and production; and dissemination capabilities. These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.

The funds in this project are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the GCWG, for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI AoA as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS-2B efforts include but are not limited to development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test, and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.

Inclusive in I&amp;TS is the Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems Automated Target Recognition (ATR) effort to further mature a robust capability to detect all classes of targets through camouflage. 

The purpose of DRACO is to create a robust Image Quality improvement capability for Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) products.  All other details are classified.  The software resided in multiple locations on the ground supporting the Air Force, Army, Navy and other customers DRACO efforts include but are not limited to development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test and transition of image quality improvement capabilities and airborne SAR Sensors. 

The Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA) program coordinates the development of advanced technologies open architecture development for the following modalities of sensors, such as RADAR, SIGINT, EW, Communications and EO/IR (development of standards and open architecture interfaces for Software, Hardware, and Electrical/Mechanical interfaces in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned.  Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly upgrade/iterate advanced interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for remotely piloted aircraft through development of abstraction interfaces for sense (RADAR, ADS-B, TCAS, etc….) and avoid logic. The program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.  The SOSA program also increases interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces, as well as leveraging industry participation towards creating COTS solutions such as common C4ISR processor, AgilePOD interfaces, Red/Black separation on the sensor, data at rest, and security/anti-tamper (AT) with industry partners and other DOD services


The project is designed to support development of next generation of sensors driven by Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) Analysis of alternatives (AoA), as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document( Next Generation Sensors), as well as AFLCMC/WI/WN/WW program of record needs.  As part of the development effort SOSA will be funding and supporting first article development of key open architecture solutions to validate/verify open specifications as well as to prime the COTS vendors development strategies.  SOSA will also stand up AFLCMC SIL for Sensors Open System Architectures to establish a strong conformance/compliance program with industry partners for COTS products in partnership with other DOD Services. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>A portion of the funding within the U-2 RDT&amp;E line will be used to advance ASARS development / design/fabrication/integration/demonstration/testing and fielding deep look high altitude ISR radar capabilities.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Imaging and Targeting Support and Agile ISR efforts are prioritized on an annual basis by the GCWG, in accordance with the validated gaps in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Resulting funded efforts are then contracted for and/or executed by either various program offices, laboratories, industry, and/or other government agencies.

ASARS / High Altitude SAR technology maturation is conducted by Air Force Life Cycle Management Center/Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and Special Operations Forces (AFLCMC/WIN), in conjunction and cooperation with AFLCMC/HBG (Robins AFB) for test support.

Acquisition strategy is to maximize commercial and national development efforts and investment through multiple contracting methods, including the use of engineering change proposals to modify existing contracts and new contracts that were awarded both competitively or on a sole source basis.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) is the DoD simulation/training system of choice for many Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), RPA, and ISR systems. MUSE is also know as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force Application. The MUSE/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates ISE &amp; strike systems, tailored air vehicle &amp; data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Still Frame Imagery, or GMTO data. Air vehicles, sensors, datalinks, takeoff and landing systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS and RPA ground stations, when actual ground stations are unavailable. FMV, still frame imagery, or GMTI data are provided. Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground ISR processors to ensure interoperability with over 40 systems within DoD.  

The Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE/AFSERS creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.

The MUSE/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.

MUSE/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the AFSERS provides imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of critical imagery processes. The MUSE/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.

The Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is the center of excellence that supports the UAS and RPA programs within the services by providing the system engineering, test and integration, interoperability, rapid technology insertion and training to address MUSE/AFSERS requirements. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. The JTC/SIL contributes to the distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, and are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Airborne Reconnaissance Systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Gorgon Stare system is a podded airborne sensor suite that provides city-sized wide area airborne surveillance and is integrated on specially-modified MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA).  The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014.  Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Development Document (draft).  The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.

Development efforts conducted with FY 2015 Congressionally added funds included efforts focused primarily on the development of a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability in support of an Urgent Operational Need.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2016 Congressionally added RDT&amp;E funds included further development and system integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Increment 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors.  Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2017 Congressionally added funds further progressed efforts associated with BLOS, to include first article testing for phase 1 and a limited BLOS capability expected to deliver to the field in FY 2019. Development efforts conducted with FY 2018 Congressionally added funds include but are not limited to efforts to further develop the design and implementation of the next BLOS phase to enable freedom of maneuverability and initial development of system imagery improvements in support of a MAJCOM validated -1067.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2019 Congressional added funds include but are not limited to; completing BLOS Phase II system design and aircraft certification to enable full freedom of maneuverability; completing imagery improvements in support of a MAJCOM validated -1067 and continuation of data automation through Area of Interest (AOI) tagging and tracking efforts.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Gorgon Stare capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>RDUCE provides the warfighter a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance  ISR sensor data and transmit near real time to tactical users through current and future bandwidth limited commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) or military SATCOM. The effort is developing, testing and will implement new sensor data compression and decompression algorithms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors. Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community (IC) Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and Measurement and Signatures Intelligence architectures.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Data Compression sensor capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Dismount Radar (DR) project designs, develops, integrates, tests, fields, and sustains Moving Target Indicator (MTI) capability for improved dismount and moving target detection, identification, tracking, and classification. This sensor will be employed on airborne platforms, such as the MQ-9 Reaper. These efforts will accelerate development of technologies and concept of operations (CONOPS) for Advance Battle Management System (ABMS) battle management command, and ground missions across the range of contested environments.

Activities also include studies, analysis, and technology development, maturation, and demonstration to support current and future program planning and execution. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Airborne Reconnaissance Systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RC-135 operational systems development and enhancement activities support the design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 programs and their specialized mission systems, both air and ground.  Associated ground systems include RIVET JOINT Mission Trainers (RJMT, a.k.a. mission crew simulators), Ground Data Processing Systems (GDPS), Distributed Mission Shelters (DMS), Mission Crew Training Systems (MCTS), Airborne Capabilities Extension System (ACES), and the Operational Flight Trainers (OFT, a.k.a. flight deck simulators).  Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through upgrades and supports Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  

These activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (645 AESG).  The 645 AESG (a.k.a. BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO) manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  

Aircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2020 budget includes developmental planning, execution and support for the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT Baselines 12 and 13 (BL-12 and BL-13), the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baselines 5 and 6 (BL-5 and BL-6), and the RC-135S COBRA BALL BL-5 and BL-6 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding incremental spiral upgrades and baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  The 645 AESG uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and associated ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and DMS/VVI logistical concerns are addressed with each baseline upgrade strategy and assessed annually as part of the fleet sustainment responsibilities.  

RIVET JOINT BL-12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, digitally enhanced electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), continued Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS) interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, enhanced operator reporting management tools, modernized communications security (COMSEC) protocols, and a new steerable beam antenna.  RIVET JOINT BL-13 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, providing a continuous recording capability, Super Wideband Compressive Receiver (SWCR) and Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR), CNS/ATM avionics upgrades such as new autopilot, automated data system-broadcast (ADS-B) and Mode 5 identify friendly or foe (IFF) systems, and family of beyond-line-of-sight terminals (FAB-T) advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) communications suite. 

COMBAT SENT BL-5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, active ranging and theater networked geo-location (TNG) capability, cooling duct and lighting improvements, RJ Baseline 11/12 (BL-11/12) communications intelligence (COMINT), upgraded computer architecture, wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, development of an airborne tracking system, communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J), and continued CNS/ATM compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.  COMBAT SENT BL-6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, steerable beams for the COMINT sub-system, improved SWCR capability and specific emitter identification (SEI) electronic intelligence (ELINT) sub-system, Primary Sensor Measurement System (PRISMS) merge with manual precision collections, millimeter wave and low band capabilities with PRISMS, digitizing antennas, direction finding of High Frequency signals and expanded streaming audio services and 360 degree aircraft tracking system. BL-6 RDT&amp;E is funded via PE 0305206G.

COBRA BALL BL-5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ BL-11/12 COMINT, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrades to include MIDS-J and an intercom system (FORCE), and continued CNS/ATM compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.  COBRA BALL BL-6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, high gain S-Band antenna, large format Sapphire windows, RJ BL-13 COMINT capability, foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT) analog to digital receiver, and Brave version of the digital cockpit avionics systems to continue CNS/ATM compliance initiatives. BL-6 RDT&amp;E is funded via PE 0301314F. 

Ground Systems Baseline upgrades add the capabilities found in the corresponding RIVET JOINT Baseline upgrades (i.e., RIVET JOINT BL-11 corresponds to Ground System BL-11, RIVET JOINT BL-12 corresponds to Ground System BL-12, RIVET JOINT BL-13 corresponds to Ground System BL-13) to the Ground Systems to ensure crews receive training on the appropriate mission system configurations.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RC-135 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RC-135 RIVET JOINT, COBRA BALL, and COMBAT SENT configured aircraft are maintained and kept technologically relevant through a baseline or incremental upgrade acquisition strategy.  Technology upgrades and Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments are acquired through the 645 AESG in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and Class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document for acquisition of supplies and services using an "other than full and open competition" criteria.  The supplies and services procured by 645 AESG satisfy National Security requirements (FAR 6.302-6) through the use of their standing J&amp;A or address Unusual and Compelling Urgency requirements (FAR 6.302-2) through an individually prepared J&amp;A supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management from developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave") support.  Due to the ever changing threat and rapidly evolving electromagnetic combat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Command (CCMD) and/or Intelligence Community (IC) requirements to better meet the war fighting objectives.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Baseline upgrades are determined by the aircraft programmed depot maintenance schedule.  Hardware, firmware or software enhancements to the ground systems are set up to match the aircraft baseline upgrades.  Typically, baseline configuration changes and enhancements are incorporated first into the RJMTs and OFTs, and then integrated into GDPS, MCTS, MPS, and ACES.  Delivery of the enhancements to the RJMTs and OFTs are planned to arrive concurrently, if not slightly prior, to the delivery of the first aircraft with an upgraded cockpit or mission system in a given baseline configuration to allow for aircrew and ground personnel training and qualification.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time- sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.

AF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs. These efforts will also integrate commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services. The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as enhance interoperability by migrating to an Open Architecture (OA) to improve data sharing ability per DoD direction.

Program management consists of five ACAT III efforts: GEOINT Transformation, SIGINT Transformation, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT): (Note: GEOINT Baseline 4.1, System Release 3.0 and SENSORS ACAT were closed in FY18 and Sensors funding/projects were merged into GEOINT Transformation ACAT in FY19).

1. GEOINT Transformation: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities, enables quick/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
2. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework.
3. Multi-INT: Rapidly integrate new multi-INT capabilities/enterprise applications and facilitate enterprise-wide collaboration capabilities. Addresses program office test and evaluation activities.
4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, cloud-enabled hybrid Platform as a Service, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery.  Initial OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture, represents the AF DCGS program's initial efforts to eventually migrate to a hybrid cloud (mix of private on-premises and public cloud) architecture 
5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.

NOTES:
*For FY20, this effort does not have any associated investment funding.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program management consists of five ACAT III efforts: GEOINT Transformation, SIGINT Transformation, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT):

1.GEOINT Transformation: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities, enables quick/seamless integration of new sensors, data types, sensor planning, command and control (C2) and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
2. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework.
3. Multi-INT: Rapidly integrate new multi-INT capabilities/enterprise applications and facilitate enterprise-wide collaboration capabilities. Addresses program office test and evaluation activities.
4. Network Infrastructure Transformation: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to a cyber-resilient, open, scalable, cloud-enabled hybrid Platform as a Service, improving data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities, collaboration, and content driven discovery.  Initial OA DCGS Platform as a Service, along with migration to a hub-based architecture, represents the AF DCGS program's initial efforts to eventually migrate to a hybrid cloud (mix of private on-premises and public cloud) architecture 
5. *DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.

NOTES:
*For FY20, this effort does not have any associated RDT&amp;E funding. The Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding is exhibited in the Procurement Documentation (WSC846080, DCGS-AF).

Intelligent Modeling and Predictive Analysis of Cyberspace Targeting (IMPACT) (Formerly known as Project SUTER) effort was moved from PE 0305221F to PE 0305208F in FY19. IMPACT develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Due to a Database Error, the additional $26M in FY19 OCO for "MQ-9 Development and Fielding" (Project 675246) was erroneously added to PE 0305208. This funding belongs in Air Force PE 0305829F,"Video Data Link". 

Video Data Link (VDL) Family of Systems (FoS) provides situational awareness (SA) to the operator on the ground using real time Full Motion Video (FMV) from secure line of sight links to airborne ISR, NTISR, PR and SF platforms. The FoS consists of interoperable Mounted (Airborne/Ground) and Handheld terminal variants. Current variants are utilized with 20 different platforms. Crypto Core Modernization (CCM) driven by NSA will create an imminent DMS issue by FY21; the current VDL equipment is incompatible with the enhanced Crypto Core.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The sum of all Prior Years is actually $2,116.752 million more than the represented total due to several projects ending.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds related Air Force projects sharing the RQ-4 platform in common: the RQ-4 Block 30, the RQ-4 Block 40, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, and Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP). The RQ-4 Block 30 and Block 40 projects support the development and testing of the ACAT 1C RQ-4 capability and the initiation of the major modification ACAT programs. The majority of the modernization funding was transferred to the Capability Enhancement project (675149) to support upgrades and modifications, including established ACAT I and II programs, to the fielded RQ-4 weapon system to meet evolving threats and warfighter requirements. The MP-RTIP project completes development and testing of the baseline MDAP MP-RTIP sensor capability.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.

Per direction of USD(AT&amp;L), the RQ-4 program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30, (2) Block 40, (3) GroundSegment/Communications System, and (4) Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA). In FY17 the Ground Segment/Communications System project (675147) ended. Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144 and $85.375M were accounted for in project 675147.

The FY2018 funding was increased by $8.000 million to develop a Block 40 ISR Payload Adapter design and documentation.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The RQ-4 Block 30 Project was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of projects, budgets had already been finalized.  Prior budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 Baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for Block 30 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) sensors, the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP), and alternate sensor payloads.

This funding also supports aircraft systems upgrades to include continuing airframe updates, aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, airspace and interoperability enhancements, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).

Activities include mission planning interoperability enhancements, weather capability enhancements and testing, airspace and interoperability enhancements and updates, airframe and software upgrades and deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, sensor interoperability and communication enhancements and alternate sensor upgrades, upgrades to ASIP Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) sensor, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) development and testing, development and testing activities associated with enhancing sensor capability and sensor integration, integration of alternate sensors, development and testing of ice protection system, support of demonstration/development and technology insertion, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  

This project supports system engineering/program management, test and evaluation, management services, and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.  The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, system upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.  MS-177 Sensor Enhancement RDT&amp;E is being contracted directly with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), United Technology Corporation Aerospace Systems (UTAS).

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The RQ-4 Block 40 Project was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of projects, budgets had already been finalized.  Prior budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 Baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.

In FY 2019,  PE 0305220F, RQ-4 UAV, Project 675146, RQ-4 Block 40, efforts were transferred to PE 0305220F, RQ-4 UAV, Project 675149, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, in order to allow greater visibility into Global Hawk modernization efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. 

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 40 aircraft, including further development, creation of additional radar modes, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities. The Block 40 program provides critical Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data to the warfighter. This funding also supports continued aircraft/communications systems upgrade to include Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), mission planning upgrade development and testing, airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, enhanced weather capability, development and testing of ice protection system, additional radar modes, sensor enhancements, reliability and maintainability improvements, Airframe improvements to support alternate sensors, and support of demonstration and technology insertion. Funding continues RQ-4 unique development and integration of upgraded capabilities. 

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.

The RQ-4 program will maintain capability and interoperability for Block 40 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.

Activities also include studies and analysis, support to future system enhancements, communication and interoperability enhancements, current and future program planning, and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: a legacy Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) "C" contract is being phased out with the completion of current efforts; Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for RQ-4 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for current and  alternate sensor payloads.

This funding also supports aircraft systems upgrades to include continuing airframe updates, aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, airspace and interoperability enhancements, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  This project will include systems engineering/program management, configuration and data management, test and evaluation, management services, Deficiency Report (DR)/Military Intelligence Program (MIP) Investigations, studies and analysis and fielding support for Block 30, Block 40, and Ground Segment/Communication Systems.

Activities include airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, airframe and software upgrades, effort to bring early production aircraft to current operational configurations, deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, sensor enhancements and alternate sensor upgrades including the MS-177 and the Optical Bar Camera (OBC), ISR Payload Adapter, enhanced communications capabilities, support for demonstration and technology insertion, development and testing of ice protection system, enhanced mission flexibility to accommodate changes to mission objectives inflight, enhancements to support multi-domain contested environment operations, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  Additionally, this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 20/30/40 aircraft, including further development, mode creation, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities, continued aircraft/communications systems upgrade, increased power generation, additional radar modes, reliability and maintainability improvements, Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) efforts, as well as next-generation communications capabilities. GSMP resolves fleet grounding Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence issues associated with ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. It will also enhance interoperability data dissemination as well as provide training capability. CSMP resolves critical DMS and obsolescence issues in the RQ-4 communication infrastructure and provides enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network.

RDT&amp;E funding in this project also supports design, development, integration and testing of the weapon system's legacy ground elements and communications capabilities to enhance functionality and maintain interoperability prior to GSMP/CSMP fielding.  The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Elements (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Elements (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence information while remaining compliant with DoD cybersecurity network requirements to operate in the DoD Information Network (DoDIN).

This project supports system engineering/program management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.  

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements. The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, system upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.  MS-177 Sensor Enhancement RDT&amp;E is being contracted directly with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), United Technology Corporation Aerospace Systems (UTAS).

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY09, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) funding was transferred to program 0305220F (RQ-4) Global Hawk (GH).  Therefore, the data in this package includes only FY09 and subsequent funding related to program 0305220F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project (67RTIP) includes MP-RTIP modernization and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 Platform. MP-RTIP modernization studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), Maritime Inverse SAR(MISAR), product improvements and other advanced capabilities. GH Program Office will continue integration of radar capabilities to include Maritime Modes integration into RQ-4 aircraft and ground systems. 

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MPRTIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F,0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2019, PE 0305221F, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675275, SUTER efforts were transferred to PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Common Imagery Ground/Surface Systems, in order to facilitate the development and integration of SUTER as a mission application on Open Architecture (OA) DCGS.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies supporting the horizontal and/or vertical integration of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems.  The result of such integration is a multi-intelligence (multi-INT) sensor network.  Operationally, NCCT core technologies provide a tactical collaborative multi-INT geolocation capability employed against high-value targets.  NCCT software supports Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cross-cueing and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate collection activities across the NCCT network.  NCCT correlation and fusion software ingests collection data to produce a single, composite track (geolocation and identification) in near real-time for high-value targets.  SUTER supports development of sub nodal analysis tools.  Operationally, such tools can be used to identify the nodes within an adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects.

NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, a network messaging standard, correlation and fusion software, software supporting tactical-to-national Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Concept of Operations (CONOPS), NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items and operator interfaces.  Development funds support software modifications required for technology modernization specific to network and fusion architecture design, data fusion algorithms and cyber security, while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). FY 2020 funding will be dedicated to transitioning software development from Core Technology to a cloud architecture (v6.0) and fielding follow-on Core Technology Software versions as necessary. 

SUTER develops concepts, TTPs and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  SUTER's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ M2M interfaces and IP communications to impact these target sets by attacking or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc.  The three main pieces of the SUTER CONOPS include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Center, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface, all involved players monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NCCT and SUTER capability.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies supporting the horizontal and/or vertical integration of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems.  The result of such integration is a multi-intelligence (multi-INT) sensor network.  Operationally, NCCT core technologies provide a tactical collaborative multi-INT geolocation capability employed against high-value targets.  NCCT software supports Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cross-cueing and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate collection activities across the NCCT network.  NCCT correlation and fusion software ingests collection data to produce a single, composite track (geolocation and identification) in near real-time for high-value targets.  

NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, a network messaging standard, correlation and fusion software, software supporting tactical-to-national (SIGINT) CONOPS, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and operator interfaces.  Development funds support software modifications required for technology modernization specific to network and fusion architecture design, data fusion algorithms, and cyber security, while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  FY 2020 funding will be dedicated to transitioning software development from Core Technology to a cloud architecture (v6.0) and fielding follow-on Core Technology Software versions as necessary.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) Core Technology capabilities are developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG) in accordance with their Program Management Directive (PMD), Class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A), and Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management ("cradle to grave" support concept). Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging/evolving Combatant Commander requirements.

645 AESG, Wright Patterson AFB OH, manages the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts used to develop NCCT Core Technology.  645 AESG will develop NCCT Core Technology software on common hardware for systems and platforms designated to field this ISR capability.  Individual platform program management offices may contract directly with their prime contractors or through the 645 AESG for integration of NCCT capabilities on their respective systems and platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>SUTER develops concepts, TTPs and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  SUTER's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ M2M interfaces and IP communications to impact these target sets by attacking or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc.  The three main pieces of the SUTER CONOPS include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Center, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface, all involved players monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Prior to FY 2017, SUTER capabilities were developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645 AESG. In FY 2017, due to software limitations and a lack of technical maturity of SUTER's capabilities, the Air Force decided not to proceed with the 645 AESG technical plan on SUTER and transitioned SUTER program execution responsibilities to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). AFRL is increasing the technical maturity of the SUTER software and capabilities to a level suitable for operational capability and for transition to PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Common Imagery Ground/Surface Systems. This transition will be made in order to facilitate the development and integration of SUTER as a mission application on Open Architecture (OA) DCGS.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds the U.S. contribution to the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Direct Commercial Sale acquisition.  AGS is an airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance in all weather conditions.  It will provide NATO decision makers with near real time information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting.  All NATO nations will have access to AGS collection data, creating opportunities for burden sharing with similar U.S. assets.  

The AGS program includes: air and ground segment acquisitions, operations of the NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), development of operations and support definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  The air segment consists of five (5) air vehicles based on unique exportable configurations of the United States Air Force Global Hawk air frame, Navy Triton command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar.  The U.S. will also integrate new Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS.  The ground segment consists of fixed site and transportable/mobile ground stations for air vehicle Command and Control (C2), data exploitation and distribution.  Operations and continuing In-Service Support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).

U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) signature/approval of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009 and includes 15 nations. In FY 2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS program to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution of the Research and Development effort.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds 1) the Intelligence Integration Office (I2O), formerly the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Multi-service Execution Team (MET) Office (DMO), which oversees the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) development, modernization, integration, test, and community support in support of Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E), Combatant Commands and Coalition/Partner Intel Operations and 2) the DCGS Enterprise Interoperability effort and 3) the
Imagery Processing effort which consists of the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) program.

1)The I2O oversees Enterprise Interoperability for Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E), Combatant Commands and Coalition/Partner Intel Operations. All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the DoD's net-centric vision. The DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, modernization, integration, test, and community support of the Enterprise services to include implementation of international standards(including NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable
interoperability and component reuse and provide a flexible and singularly sustainable path to information sharing across the global ISR enterprise. The follow-on effort, Next Generation Interoperability (NGI), will deliver and maintain modernized federation profiles, interfaces, methodologies, and data interchange standards without relying upon legacy DIB federation standards and dependencies through common language, common mechanisms, and quality exposure. The deployment of these services into the DI2E Common Data Fabric (CDF) will provide common applications and a managed service framework for the development, test and integration of machine-aided decision making capabilities. The I2O manages the DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) at Hanscom AFB. This facility supports software development and test for DI2E evaluation during exercises such as Enterprise Challenge and Storm Force.

2) The DCGS Enterprise Interoperability effort provides support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS and NATO interoperability efforts. This includes the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.

3) The Imagery Processing effort develops the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) within the DCGS architecture. The VIP-C provides end-to-end image processing to include raw data ingest, data format standardization to facilitate exploitation, secondary image processing, metadata conditioning, and image quality enhancements. Current efforts are focused on 1) ensuring new sensors being fielded and associated data types can be processed and 2) increasing investment in the
Machine Assisted Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Exploitation (MAGE) capability.
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Imagery Processing effort develops the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) within the DCGS architecture.  VIP-C accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and/or the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts include further developing the virtual software capability to improve processing across the enterprise and testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.  In addition, the project involves increasing investment in the Machine Assisted Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Exploitation (MAGE) capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>International Intelligence Technology and Architectures oversees, manages, and provides the United States (US) component of the multi-national Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (US BICES) with a collaborative environment and intelligence sharing enterprise required for processing and disseminating critical intelligence information between and among US, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), allied and coalition forces. The US BICES program procures and maintains a standing intelligence information sharing capability across Department of Defense (DoD), Combat Support Agencies, and multiple Combatant Commands (CCMD) for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (OUSD(I). At the request of OUSD(I), US BICES is extended beyond NATO nations into all CCMDs to support their unique  partner relationships.  This architecture is known as US BICES Extended (US BICES-X). US BICES provides an "enduring" US and Coalition interoperable intelligence and information sharing multi-level secure technical architecture utilizing releasable elements of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework and functions to support the full spectrum of intelligence operations and dissemination throughout the DoD community. US BICES/US BICES-X has been designated the enduring intelligence and information sharing component of the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).

Research and Development funding will:
- Provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System Family of Systems.
- Expand available intelligence disciplines (Geospatial Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potentially Human Intelligence) to support US and allied/coalition forces.  Support increased intelligence advanced analytics tools, Joint Intelligence Operation Center-IT and DI2E developments to significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.
- Develop and enhance a federated Trusted Network Environment (TNE) that incorporates the Asian Pacific intelligence Information Network to support the National Defense Strategy.
- Develop multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.
- Expand capabilities for bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs in support of CCMD requirements.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Rapid Cyber Acquisition as executed by the Cyber Capabilities Support Office (CCSO) delivers rapid offensive cyber and network exploitation capabilities to the 24th Air Force, Combatant Commanders, and Joint Force Commanders in mission-relevant timeframes (0-60 days). These capabilities support US national security interests and enhance the nation's ability to operate within the highly-dynamic cyberspace domain. The CCSO provides novel solution sets for offensive cyberspace operations to include attack, network exploitation, command and control, situational awareness, and combat support during all phases of warfare.

The CCSO expedites cyber development and modifications of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities through the integration with and technical support to other Service and Government Agency activities to leverage select Air Force-developed technologies and/or operational capabilities. CCSO develops material or non-material cyber solutions and conducts rapid prototyping, integration, and transition activities of cyber capabilities. Activities include but are not limited to development of software/hardware systems, integration and transition of lab-developed cyber capabilities, developmental testing, operational evaluation, manpower, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction efforts for emerging technologies.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Within Rapid Cyber Acquisition, the Cyber Capabilities Support Office (CCSO) utilizes a tailorable acquisition strategy that facilitates rapid delivery of material and non-material solutions to solve operational cyber operations requirements.  This approach allows flexibility for solutions to enter the acquisitions process at any phase of the acquisition life cycle. All plans contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process.  CCSO provides the research and development, developmental testing, necessary facilities, and associated costs supporting cyber innovation leveraging funding from Air Force and combatant commands with offensive cyber operations requirements.  This funding supports rapid development, technology transition and/or acquisition of cyber capabilities. CCSO analyzes, develops, tests, and transitions cyber capabilities to meet sponsor requirements. CCSO acquisition strategies in support of sponsor funded projects consider existing contracting and other transaction authority vehicles.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain a segment of Air Force's C2 capabilities and services associated with Personnel Recovery (PR). The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, as well as disseminating related information to all personnel recovery mission coordinators across the PR network. PRC2 provides an adaptive and networked system, delivering timely situational awareness information supporting personnel accountability and recovery mission management worldwide. PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, inter-operable and integrated set of capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to joint/coalition military personnel recovery activities, and civilian rescue missions.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.

The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities. The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of PR across the Department of Defense and other national and international entities. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

In FY 2020, Personnel Recover Mission Manager (PRMM) modifications will use an Agile software development strategy to develop, test and field PRMM versions in two week increments. The modifications will improve/validate Isolated Personnel (IP) events/alerts and enable case files for Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) and Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA). PRMM modifications will reflect the requirements and priorities identified by Air Combat Command (ACC) as the personnel recovery environment evolves to meet the needs of the war-fighter and personnel recovery efforts.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver PRC2 weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Mission Data (IMD) encompasses several key intelligence data efforts used to support IMD-dependent programs, including the fifth generation aircraft capabilities. The term IMD encompasses Red (adversary military systems), White (commercial systems), Blue (U.S. military systems), and Grey (neutral military systems) Characteristics &amp; Performance; Signatures; Geospatial Intelligence; Electronic Warfare systems and Operational Order of Battle mission data. Supports fighter/bomber operational reconnaissance and integration, focusing on leveraging fifth generation aircraft capabilities to augment the entire Combat Air Force. The PE funds: Planning &amp; direction, collection, processing &amp; exploitation, analysis &amp; production, and dissemination &amp; Evaluation  (PCPAD-E) to support IMD-dependent programs.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0401115F, project 672030, RDT&amp;E MOUS Radios, is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-130H is a medium sized tactical transport aircraft providing multi-purpose theater support throughout the globe. The C-130H fleet supports several diverse Air Force roles, including but not limited to tactical and inter-theater airlift and airdrop support, Arctic resupply, special operations support, aeromedical evacuation, aerial spraying, firefighting duties, and natural disaster and humanitarian relief missions.

C-130H AMP Increment 1 addresses modifications to meet airspace compliance mandates and safety requirements. RDT&amp;E efforts cover design, integration, developmental and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and course ware development efforts and other efforts necessary to fulfill program requirements.

C-130H AMP Increment 2 includes digital avionics upgrades (e.g. Flight Management System, improved navigation), cockpit modernization (e.g. glass/engine flight displays) and resolves select obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues. RDT&amp;E efforts will cover software development, design, integration, developmental and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) development, type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and course ware development efforts, and other efforts necessary to fulfill program requirements.

The MUOS radio funding is required for the Non Recurring Effort associated with integration, testing, TO's, Engineering drawing's, TKI, VKI, spectrum authorization, and Group A and Group B kits to support 19 aircraft.  This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including but not limited to fielding actions. Funds in FY 22-24 are required to fund additional LRIP unique C-130H aircraft requirements.

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including but not limited to prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning analysis and systems engineering activities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F. The program may also include any Contractor Manpower Equivalent (CME)/A&amp;AS support deemed necessary to support the program objectives.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

RDT&amp;E efforts include but are not limited to, design, integration, development and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts (including Mode 5 effort for the trainers) and other efforts necessary to fulfill program mandates and requirements.  Obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues will be resolved with solutions that may include life of type buys or bridge buys.  DMS efforts to include removal of end of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

The C-130H AMP Increment 1 program currently modifies up to 176 C-130H aircraft consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s,H1s and LC-130H aircraft.  The modification effort consists of 4 prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the remaining aircraft modified in the production phase.

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including but not limited to prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning analysis and systems engineering activities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F. The program may also include any Contractor Manpower Equivalent (CME)/A&amp;AS support deemed necessary to support the program objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130H AMP Increment 2 upgrades the C-130H fleet with comprehensive avionics and cockpit modernization which replaces aging unreliable equipment and adds combat capability enhancements.  It also addresses select obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues with solutions that may include life of type buys or bridge buys.  DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

RDT&amp;E efforts include but are not limited to software development, design, integration, development and operational test, studies and risk reduction efforts, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, peculiar support equipment and spares in support of trial kit installs, SIL development, type 1 training, and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts and other efforts required to fulfill requirements.

The C-130H AMP Increment 2 program modifies up to 176 aircraft consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s,H1s and LC-130H aircraft. The modification effort will have 4 prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the remaining aircraft modified in the production phase.

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including but not limited to prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning analysis and systems engineering activities.
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.  The program may also include any Contractor Manpower Equivalent (CME)/A&amp;AS support deemed necessary to support the program objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-5M operates across the entire range of military operations. It is the only aircraft capable of carrying 100% of certified air-transportable cargo and includes a dedicated passenger compartment enabling commanders to have troops and their equipment arrive in an area of operation simultaneously when national security concerns demand fast force closure. C-5M missions include strategic airlift of cargo and passengers as well as emergency aeromedical evacuation (AE). The aircraft must perform these missions throughout the worldwide air traffic control environment with the proper equipment to operate in FAA/ICAO controlled airspace. Additionally, C-5M aircraft must operate at night, in adverse weather conditions, and in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (excluding electromagnetic pulse in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversights Council (JROC) approved/validated the C-5 RERP ORD 14 Aug 01, see Appendix B, Ref YY, page 11, para 4.3.1), and High Explosive (CBRNE) environments.

C-5M communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5M to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5M CNS/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5M. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The C-5M core mission computer (CMC)/weather radar (WxR) program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and WxR. This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading module cards and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development. Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf weather radar. Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5M lavatory system.
Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.

C-5M Replace Multi-function Controls and Displays (RMCD) program helps to maintain aircraft availability and increased situational awareness though a new Multi Function Display Unit (MFDU)replace the current 20+ year MFDU design; current equipment is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Additionally, a charging solution for the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) will provide complementary situational awareness for operational mission support. The current generation of displays and controls supporting services used on the C-5M will no longer be repairable beginning in 2022 for MFDU. Without this modification, the C-5M will be unable to support the National Defense Strategy, AF Strategic Master Plan, Geographical Combatant Command Operational Plans.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F and 605833F.

Available funds will be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>C-5M Replace multi-function controls and display (RMCD) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate RMCD Line Replaceable Units (LRU) are developed and installed on the C-5M allowing aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. The C-5M RMCD program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification. The purpose of the program is to identify a suitable charging solution for Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), and replacement/alternatives to the existing multi-function control display unit (MCDU) and multi-function display unit (MFDU) LRUs while maintaining existing interfaces to legacy equipment and providing for future growth opportunities. Operational Flight Programs (OFP) updates/aggregation are required to support the latest aircraft display technologies and will be designed to ensure seamless integration into the platform.  Aircraft wiring will be replaced/upgraded as required. Use of mixed displays (current and new) is not permissible due to human factors considerations. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The RMCD program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current control and display units. This effort centers around modifying the current display units to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading displays and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development, including addition of a charging solution for EFB. This modification may include software non-recurring engineering (NRE), data, cyber security, testing, installation, spares, systems integration lab (SIL), Interim Contractor Support (ICS), program support, etc.

The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new multifunctional controls and displays replaces the current controls and displays, which are experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues. Failure to upgrade the displays to support aircraft availability will create a significant operational impact to the support of Geographic Combatant Command (GCCs) and maintaining U.S. National objectives. Further, Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F and 0605898F.

Available funds may be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-5M core mission computer (CMC) and weather radar (WxRadar) replacement program is a comprehensive, permanent sustainment modification, as described in validated requirements per AMC AF Form 1067s 11-152 and 11-153, to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and WxRadar. This effort modifies the current CMC to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of the WxRadar with margin for growth to accommodate future requirements.  This includes requirements to meet calendar year 2020 FAA Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5M lavatory system.  Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.

The CMC/WxRadar modification is necessary to keep the C-5M worldwide deployable. This effort replaces the APS-133 WxRadar, resolving severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues, using the Rockwell Collins WXR-2100 commercial off-the-shelf WxRadar, which is common to other aircraft platforms, and provides the same capability as the APS-133.  The effort also replaces the current core processing module (CPM) cards in the CMC with new Honeywell CPM II cards, providing additional processing speed and throughput capacity.

The CMC/WxRadar program is the baseline for all future modifications to the C-5M. The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the current APS-133 WxRadar and current CPM cards are both facing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues. Failure to upgrade the WxRadar and CMC to support calendar year 2020 CNS/ATM mandates and a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact. 

Available funds will be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy for this project considered every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5M core mission computer and weather radar and maintain aircraft availability in support of mobility missions worldwide. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure the core mission computer cards and weather radar, integrate and test those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft. The sole-source contract is predominately CPIF (Cost Plus Incentive Fee) with some FFP (Firm Fixed Price) elements.

Mission Systems Equipment program: The mission systems equipment redesign requires RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. Funds are required for validation and verification of the lavatory design and installation. The Mission Systems Equipment contract method was competitive through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Wyle Science, Technical, and Engineering Group was the selected source, and the contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>C-5M communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5M to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5M CNS/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5M. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) supply issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms. Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios with embedded Integrated Waveform (IW) and Second-generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO (SATURN) and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5M to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF, or MILSATCOM.

The current generation of satellites that support services used on the C-5M to provide oceanic controller/pilot data link communications (CPDLCs) to air traffic control and aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) beyond-line-of-sight command and control messages will no longer be functional after 2016. The next generation of satellites will accommodate legacy C-5M SATCOM equipment for an interim period of time to allow for integration of upgraded SATCOM equipment compatible with this satellite constellation. Without this modification, the C-5M will be unable to fly oceanic tracks and will not be able to meet aircraft separation distance requirements for civil airspace access.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of air traffic control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning. ADS-B Out will allow aircraft to provide continuous broadcast of aircraft position to both controllers and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In capable avionics. International mandates for ADS-B Out for civil airspace access call for equipage by 2020.

Available funds will be used for program management administration, studies and analysis, risk reduction efforts, Advisory and Assistance Services, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.  Funding may also be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) through studies and analysis, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, etc.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5M weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F and 605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The acquisition strategy for this program will consider every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5M CNS/ATM equipment to meet CY2020 mandates for global civil airspace access. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure CNS/ATM equipment, develop software, test and integrate those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft.  The equipment integration will require RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf and non-developmental item proofing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-17 can perform the entire spectrum of airlift missions and is specifically designed to operate effectively and efficiently in both strategic and theater environments.  Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during air/land operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.

C-17 Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding efforts support, but are not limited to:  Aircraft performance improvements, aircraft mission execution and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; software development, test and integration; block development/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-17 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

In FY20 the efforts are:  Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC)and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) which will be covered in more detail on subsequent pages.

This funding includes Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform-related rapid capability development process activities including early planning, analysis and systems engineering activities which provide linkages between operational needs, system performance requirements, technology needs and opportunities, potential lifecycle costs and enabling the technical foundation for material development.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0401132F, project 675061, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.

This project also provides RDT&amp;E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as "Block" upgrades or "Capability" updates. Content/requirements for these efforts is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined through the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process or other approved C-130J Joint User Group (JUG)processes. Activities required to complete development and integration of the common-core capabilities for all United States' variants are included in this project.

This project also provides RDT&amp;E funding for requirements that are outside of the JUG or COSSURM process. These efforts may include communication and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) system updates.  The requirements are identified and concurred between the C-130J Program Office and Air Mobility Command (AMC).  Requirements are documented through the C-130J Program Office approval process.

This project provides RDT&amp;E funding for studies and risk reduction activities.

This project includes RDT&amp;E funding for the following C-130J aircraft variants: C-130J stretch aircraft, C-130J short aircraft, EC-130J aircraft, WC-130J aircraft, HC-130J aircraft, MC-130J aircraft, and AC-130J aircraft. 

This project included RDT&amp;E funding for Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) platform related activities including, but not limited to, prototyping, capability development, process activities, planning analysis, and systems engineering activities.   

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130J weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-130J aircraft will be modified using a "block upgrade" strategy. The CNS/ATM, navigation safety requirement will initially, be met in three block upgrades. Block 6.0 development was funded from FY03-07. Block 7.0 started in FY07, and Block 8.1 began in FY12. Subsequently, C-130J modifications will be grouped into smaller updates known as Capability Management Updates (CMU).  Other AMC initiatives are upgrades to hardware and software that have arisen after the formation of the block upgrades and CMUs.

In order to better manage the fleet and to avoid having to simultaneously support three separate aircraft configurations (Block 6, Block 7 and Block 8.1) the USAF has decided to combine the Block 7 and Block 8.1 mods.  This will allow the aircraft and trainers to only have to be modified one time.

The proportion of CNS/ATM and navigation safety requirements allocated to Blocks 6.0 through 8.1 was determined via a design trade study conducted by Lockheed Martin (the C-130J prime contractor) and verified by the C-130J system program office and AMC. The development costs are being shared via a global Project Arrangement (PA) by the United States (USAF, USMC, USCG), the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Norway. An international program office (IPO), with USAF lead (Wright Patterson AFB, OH), manages the block upgrades development and CMU efforts. Retrofit of a Block on the aircraft is the responsibility of each nation.

In order to meet the Federal Aviation Administration 2020 mandate the USAF will install the Block 8.1 ADS-B Out/Mode V IFF solution on all C-130J variants not scheduled to receive Block 8.1 by January 2020.  This is Mod #8649, ADS-B Out Acceleration. All C-130Js will still require Block 8.1.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat. The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN/AAQ-24V] consists of missile warning sensors (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles. The number of sensors and transmitter assemblies per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft. The system is fully automatic following system power-up. LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98. The system is currently installed on 54+ aircraft types and over 1200 aircraft.

The baseline program development is complete.  Follow-on efforts are addressing integration onto new aircraft types and existing LAIRCM platforms, design changes to address Reliability Maintainability &amp; Availability and system improvements to counter new and emerging threats. 

LAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to, hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats. 

Current and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Testing; Hardware, Software and Firmware Upgrades; Virtual System Integration Lab (SIL) Development; and Studies and Analysis.

Threat Analysis: Threat analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required. Typical threat analysis activities include: threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to infrared countermeasures (IRCM).

Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation Testing: Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation activities verify and validate the information obtained from the threat analysis activities. These activities include: evaluation of (IRCM) techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.

Hardware, Software, and Firmware Upgrades: Includes changes of any kind to any LAIRCM hardware components/support equipment with the purpose of adding capability, features, and enhancements which do not presently exist to ensure the LAIRCM system remains viable against current and emerging threats.
-----Hardware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, test and produce new capabilities, features, and enhancements, and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM hardware with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.
-----Software upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the new or modified code that result in new capabilities, features, and enhancements and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM software with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist. Software upgrades can occur in any of the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) Operation Flight Programs as well as any of the software residing in other LAIRCM associated components including those systems which support development and test or the LAIRCM support equipment.
-----Firmware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the upgrades and those changes resulting from hardware and software updates/modifications as well as firmware upgrades which add new features.

Virtual SIL Development: Incrementally design, develop, integrate, and test software code and purchase associated infrastructure (i.e., computers, servers, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, etc.) necessary to develop and implement a virtual SIL providing a critical capability for testing the LAIRCM system to ensure continued effectiveness against current and emerging threats.

Studies and Analysis: Includes logistics, programmatic, and engineering studies and analysis activities to ensure continued system viability and sustainability and compliance with acquisition directives. These activities may include the evaluation of low cost/high payback opportunities to reduce software development/implementation cost, enhance production efficiency, and improve life cycle costs through increased reliability and reduced repair and return cost.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to, contract services and government costs. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Aircraft Survivability weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aero-I SATCOM Replacement program will replace the obsolete Inmarsat Aero-I system with an Iridium system.  Inmarsat's existing third generation satellites (I-3) which provide Aero-I services will no longer be functional after 31 Dec 22.  Aero-I services are used to provide oceanic Controller/Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) to Air Traffic Control and Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Command and Control (C2) messages to 618th Tactical Air Control Center (TACC) Global Decision Support System.  The procurement effort modifies 359 C/KC-135s and 19 Simulators. Funding may be used to address DMS issues.

During acquisition strategy development, it was determined RDT&amp;E funding (FY18 and FY19) is not required to field this capability.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The KC-10 is an aerial refueling asset built on the commercial DC-10 airframe.  This aircraft creates an air bridge enabling rapid global mobility and global strike missions.  There are 59 KC-10 aircraft in the USAF tanker fleet. KC-10 has a divestiture strategy that will follow Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act and Air Force requirements.

Mode 5 program is a Department of Defense mandated upgrade to the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, the primary means of command and control aircraft identification.  Mode 5 increases anti-spoofing capabilities and lowers the possibility of aircraft/aircrew loss due to misidentification of friendly aircraft.  The KC-10 modification program includes a Mode 5 capable APX-119 transponder, a new KIV-77 crypto applique and integration/control through the CDU-7000F flight management computer. 

A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out upgrade to the KC-10 is also included as part of Mode 5 to meet DO-260B requirements set by the FAA. Both IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out are mandated programs (Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 047-07 and FAA Advisory Circular 20-165B) that have a required incorporation no later than 1 January 2020 (ADS-B) and 1 July 2020 (Mode 5).  Both modifications are accomplished by modification of the APX-119 Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and can easily be accomplished at the same time and at a significant cost savings to the Air Force. 

The program completes formal Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and will procure kits for installation on all KC-10 aircraft.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-10 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
October 2017, VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) was de-scoped from upgrading the flight deck avionics to compliance with the mandates for civil Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and DoD Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 capability supporting the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  

Installations are aligned with the aircraft heavy maintenance (HM) schedule. The de-scoped AMP requirements to ADS-B Out and IFF Mode 5 must integrate the 2020 mandate capability in HM18-8 and HM20-9 utilizing the remaining FY18 and FY19 funds for test, tech data integration, SIL, field team and other government costs. The National Security Waiver signed by Secretary of the Air Force 11 Dec 18 included the capability for ADS-B Out and IFF Mode 5 full FAA compliance 2025, which would utilize procurement funds but has not been funded.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>VC-25A AMP, ADS-B Out and IFF Mode 5 is being accomplished by developmental integration of commercial off-the-shelf systems, hardware procurement and installation aligns with HM depot schedules. A Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract was awarded Sep 17 to complete non-recurring engineering, kit, tech data and SIL development. The remaining RDT&amp;E effort includes the second kit, install, correcting wiring diagrams in the WIRS system, finalizing tech data development, tech data integration into maintenance manuals, SE/PM, Other Government Cost (OGC) and PMA. Delivery of the first aircraft is scheduled in FY19 and second kit configuration in FY20.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is the Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt rotor aircraft. The CV-22 provides long-range, high-speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. The Navy is the lead service for the Joint V-22 program.  The Joint Program Manager is responsible for managing all variants of the V-22.  Department of the Navy (DoN) funds the development of the MV-22 and CMV-22.  The Air Force funds the service common portion of the CV-22 while United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) funds the development and procurement of SOF peculiar systems.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E funding provides for the development, integration, and testing of service-common, mission critical aircraft modifications to improve operational effectiveness, platform survivability, and aircraft availability.  
 
Nacelle Improvements:  Funds the design and development of the CV-22 nacelle to increase engine time on wing by reducing ingestion of sand/dust and other particulate matter into the engine, improving reliability and maintainability and reducing operations and support costs.  This is Air Force Special Operations Command's #1 priority for the CV-22 weapon system. 

Enhanced Self-Deployment:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for the design, development, and testing of aircraft modifications to improve aircraft self-deployment capabilities (e.g., operating range, global response time) to mitigate emerging threats to the aircraft and mission accomplishment, and to identify and assess emerging air vehicle, propulsion system, avionics architecture, electronic warfare, situational awareness, and other weapon system solutions in meeting CV-22 Block C/20 capability requirements.  

Future Capabilities/Affordable Sustainability:  Funding provides for future modification planning, and for aircraft engineering changes/upgrades to address diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) and component obsolescence issues adversely affecting aircraft readiness and operational availability rates, as well as improved operational safety, suitability, cyber security, and mission effectiveness.
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CV-22 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office (Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM), PMA-275) is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in block increments.  

--Nacelle Improvements:  IIS, IRS and GCU will utilize some combination of sole source and competitive contracts. 

--Enhanced Self-Deployment Capabilities: The Army Technology Applications Program Office at Ft Eustis awarded a FFP contract in June 2016 for LRU-1 Ethernet design (IBR) with additional RAA funds added in  September 2017.  The FY2019 plan is to add incremental funding for LRU-1 Ethernet Design Phase 2 and Phase 3.  FY2020 will begin the integration and testing phase. 

Development activities for the V-22 program to date have been primarily performed by the prime contractor, Bell-Boeing, on a sole-source basis.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification

Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) Increment 1.
The CAMPS Increment I program is the primary critical joint requirements management system for Special Assignment Air Mission (SAAM), Air Refueling (AR) scheduling, and Intra-theater air movement requests. It is also the primary USTRANSCOM and Air Mobility Command Command and Control (AMC C2) planning and scheduling tool enabling Mobility Air Force (MAF) resources to support peacetime, contingency, humanitarian, and wartime operations. In the Air Refueling Management System (ARMS), CAMPS provides the ability to request, manage and validate requests for air refueling.  Force-level CAMPS users include the USTRANSCOM Fusion Center, 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), and other AOC Air Mobility Divisions (AMDs). Several web-based applications also support movement and air refueling requests for globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing/Unit level users.

The 618 AOC (TACC) is a global air operations center responsible for planning and executing airlift and air refueling missions in support of the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE). Although primarily used by the 618 AOC (TACC), CAMPS also supports validation, planning, and scheduling activities found at AMD and USTRANSCOM. CAMPS airlift and air refueling requirement management applications are available for all globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing/Unit level users that need to request airlift or air refueling. 

The current CAMPS AR scheduling capability does not have access to all data sources necessary to maintain visibility of and support for all potential re-planning requirements and therefore can have ‘blind spots' which hinder its ability to provide robust support for planning and re-planning across the entire "initial through final” planning phase. This CAMPS Increment I (modernization) effort will build on the existing technology transitioned from RDT&amp;E initiatives.  

FY19 continued funding for Air Refueling scheduling capability development and testing to provide planners an integrated human-in-the-loop and machine-based cooperative system which provides the ability to rapidly generate and evaluate multiple potential solution candidates to satisfy  requirements.  This increases the effectiveness and efficiency with which Air Refueling assets are employed and support increased operational agility through rapid, effective and efficient re-planning while minimizing the impact on currently planned mission sets.  The AR scheduling metrics component enables on-going improvement of the AR scheduling system and can be developed after extensive analysis and iterations with the constituent user sets and command authorities. Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401840F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization development for the Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Kit. This program is part of the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train, and modernize the existing and future Family of Systems (FoS) that provide a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability. It also provides a suite of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the ST community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in ST System Development focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities, which are not limited to: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, medical monitoring, and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) C4ISR System and all other ST capability needs.

This program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen ST operators to recognize, identify, range, nominate, and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, track, fix targets, and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre- and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. BAO Kit systems are light, compact, and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY20 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness, and precision lethality in the battle space while continuing to build and enhance the BAO Kit family of systems. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes, and associated engineering support to posture the BAO Kit for technology insertion.  These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increase mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. BAO also supports AFSOC Tactical Command and Control (TAC C2) programs to develop and enhance communications systems and equipment essential for ST combat controllers, pararescue, combat weather operators, and tactical air controller parties within AFSOC to perform their mission. The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield/assault landing/drop zone operations. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements. The above efforts may change based on the need to support current Air Force mission requirements.  


This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver special tactic capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

The Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies, analysis, and risk-reduction activities to support both current and future program planning and execution.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops, tests, and evaluates national and Air Force measurement standards (hardware) and calibration equipment in support of all Air Force programs and activities, including Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) worldwide.  Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&amp;D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&amp;D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute and deliver 0702207F.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.    

Program is managed by Air Force Materiel Command, Agile Combat Support Directorate, Air Force Metrology Division (WNM).

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY2020 PE 0708055F, MROi efforts were transferred from Project 675207 to Project 675329, Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul Initiative, in order to improve transparency of this Business System Category II (BCAT II), formerly an ACAT I acquisition program.

Prior years funding $23.126M was executed in PE 0708610F

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
MROi creates and integrate capability that plans, schedules and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.

FY20 funding will support the continued development and integration leading to planned Full Deployment Decision capabilities. The MROi implementer will continue to configure the Oracle suite; configure associated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) support software; and develop Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE) software. Collaborative and combined development and operational testing is being performed iteratively throughout the development, configuration, integration, and deployment using the Oracle Unified Methodology (OUM) which is inherently agile to achieve the benefits of the Agile Software Development Methodology. Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development, and mobile applications.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2018 PE 0708610F, Project 675207, MROi efforts were transferred to PE 0708055F, Project 675207, Maintenance Repair &amp; Overhaul, in order to improve transparency of this Business System Category II (BCAT II), formerly an ACAT I acquisition program.

Prior Years Funding $23.126M was executed in PE 0708610F.

As a result of the transition of Defense Business Systems from DoDI 5000.02 to DoDI 5000.75, MROi was reclassified to a BCAT II program as reflected in the 11 APR 2018 MROi Milestone B ADM.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi) is an enterprise resource planning IT system that provides an integrated capability for planning, scheduling, and executing organic depot maintenance to support agile planning, optimized workload assignment and resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter. Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MROi system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020 PE 0708055, Project 675207, MROi efforts will transfer to PE 0708055F, Project 675329, Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul System, in order to improve transparency of this Business System Category II (BCAT II), formerly an ACAT I acquisition program.

FY18/19 funds of $82.610 M will be executed from PE 0708055F, Project 675207. Prior Year Funding $23.126M was executed in PE 0708610F.

As a result of the transition form DoDI 5000.02 to DoDI 5000.75, MROi was reclassified to a BCAT II program as reflected in the 11 Apr 2018 MROi Milestone B ADM.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi) is an enterprise resource planning IT system that provides an integrated capability for planning, scheduling, and executing organic depot maintenance to support agile planning, optimized workload assignment and resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.

FY 2020 funding will support the development and integration of MROi, leading to a planned Full Deployment Decision/Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (ATP). Additionally, funding will support advisory and assistance services necessary to assist in the planning, development, execution, and reporting of system program office duties and responsibilities. Funding may also support MROi unique/non-common capabilities to be hosted in and maintained by the Common Computing Environment managed by AFLCMC/HNI Capabilities Integration Environment(CIE). The MROi implementer will continue to configure the Oracle suite; configure associated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) support software; develop Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE) software; and develop training materials. Development Testing (DT) activities will continue. Collaborative and combined development and operational testing is being performed iteratively throughout the development, configuration, integration, and deployment using the Oracle Unified Methodology (OUM) which is inherently agile to achieve the benefits of the Agile Software Development Methodology. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MROi system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program, BA 7, PE 0708610F, project 675207, Transformation Capability Initiative - Supply Capability Initiative (SCI), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires an integrated logistics capability that provides timely, accurate and reliable information to decision makers at all levels of command and across the full range of military operations.  

FIAR and Software Upgrades:

- The remediation and modification of core logistics systems is necessary for the AF to meet statutory Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirements and align with the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-4 Concept for Logistics, and the AF Portfolio Board's approved Logistics Flight Plan. The AF must concurrently sustain and modify identified logistics systems to achieve FIAR remediation by the statutory deadline; execute software upgrades to reduce high operating costs and meet evolving operational demands; implement statutory compliance requirements; improve system performance; and enable system consolidation efforts that lower the cyber threat space and reduce long-term portfolio costs.

- Identified systems include, but are not limited to, the Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Commercial Asset Visibility - Air Force (CAV-AF) Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS), Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), and Stock Control System (SCS). Additional logistics system may be included as financial audits are completed and system consolidation efforts mature.

Transformation:

- The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous custom stovepipe systems and processes that perform similar tasks. Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more secure, resilient, efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics. The objective of transformation is to conduct Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to identify and eliminate overlaps in business processes across core logistics systems and, where appropriate, implement new IT systems that employ best commercial practices and modern cloud-based architectures. 

- The AF will take full advantage of the flexibilities provided by DoDI 5000.75, Business Systems Requirements and Acquisition guidance, as well as Agile development methodologies to identify requirements across the spectrum of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P); and to acquire and deploy approved material solutions in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  The Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) identifies five phases: Capability Need Identification; Business Solution Analysis; Business System Functional Requirements and Acquisition Planning; Business System Acquisition, Testing, and Deployment; and, Capability Support. These phases are structured to optimize joint responsibility of functional and acquisition activities leading to the successful delivery of business capability with an emphasis on acquisition of business systems aligned to commercial best practices utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) solutions, to the extent possible.

- The AF logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas, to include base- and depot-level maintenance, end-to-end supply chain management, and predictive analysis and forecasting. The AF will standardize its business processes within each major logistics functional area through Transformational Capability Initiatives (CIs). These CIs include, but are not limited to: Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi), Item Master, Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). There may be one or more specific initiatives aligned to each of the major CI areas referenced above.


Transformation Capability Initiatives:

- Item Master Logistics Capability Initiative (IMLCI) provides the capability to manage comprehensive, accurate, reliable item master data (e.g., accurate identification and authorization of owners and users of items).  SCM Item Master is a key component of the Air Force (AF) Logistics Capability Transformation Plan.  It will provide Item standardization and configuration management from a single authoritative source, ensuring foundational logistics processes are executed in concert to support the A4 logistics baseline.  Item Master will enable key integration and transformation capabilities, including IUID association to business transactions; streamlined management of part item attributes across supply, finance, engineering, technology, transportation, maintenance, and vendor communities; and provide translation capabilities between functional and technical business communities and systems.

- SCM Supply Capability Initiative is focused on enabling simplified, standardized processes to fundamentally enhance the business operations and provide total asset visibility across the supply chain.  These improvements have been identified in the USAF Logistics Capabilities Transformation Plan.

- SCM Field Maintenance will improve the AF field maintenance capabilities across Mission Generation Network (MGN) and Repair Network (RN) (e.g. propulsion, avionics, command and control (C2) enabler systems, cyber systems, communications-electronics &amp; simulation, Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL), etc.) including the planning, scheduling, execution and oversight of functional deficiencies incurred over the past 10 years due to lack of prioritized funding and failure of the previous enterprise-wide modernization approach.

- PLM enables AF engineering/logistics communities to define, track, protect and manage product data for AF weapon systems and equipment. The AF requires the ability to control configuration of the product throughout the life of the asset. Standardized configuration control will ensure validity, accuracy, reliability, currency, and security of the product information, which will increase weapon system readiness by decreasing costs to manage, protect, store and deliver product information.

- Funds will be used to perform innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application. 

- This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver our integrated logistics capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 06065833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Force Program Executive Office - Business Enterprise Systems (AFPEO-BES) is evaluating systems under the DoDI 5000.75 to approve authorities to proceed (ATP) for each core logistics system remediation/modification project.

The Logistics IT program utilizes the Agile software development methodology in the acquisition of these projects. The projects will use Firm Fixed Price contracts to the maximum extent possible as the program establishes new contracts or task orders. To improve the efficiency of the contracting process and reduce contract cycle time, the core logistics system program offices plan to use the existing NETCENTS-2 contract vehicle utilizing Best Value acquisition methodology where possible. 

Agile development practices transform IT acquisitions by delivering capabilities faster and responding more effectively to changes in operations, technology, and budgets. The four objectives of Agile software development are: 1. Focusing on small, frequent capability releases; 2. Valuing working software over comprehensive documentation; 3. Responding rapidly to changes in operations, technology, and budgets; 4. Actively involving users throughout development to ensure high operational value.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) capability provides a Business Intelligence (BI) and Decision Support (DS) solution for the A4 community. USAF decision-makers, maintainers and planners require increased access to comprehensive data related to platform mission, operational status, support equipment availability and parts. This data is required to be accessible in a number different configurations ranging from preformatted executive dashboards to highly customizable ad-hoc reporting to enable improved decision making based on accurate, near-real-time data available in a simple self-service environment that provides detailed supply chain data from lowest levels all the way up to operational planners and senior leadership. By aggregating and exposing data from over 130 data sources, LIMS-EV provides warfighters with timely, authoritative information to make informed decisions.

The LIMS-EV capability is migrating, along with the rest of AF Data Services, from GCSS-AF heritage to a commercial government cloud-configured environment. That move will result in improved performance, greater scalability and reliability, enhanced ability to leverage Software as a Service (SAAS), and reduced operational costs from utilization of common infrastructure. This move will also result in implementation of new system engineering processes based on agile software development/rapid prototyping via the CCE 2.0 dev/test/production environments and Data Services development laboratories and will leverage cloud best practices including streamlined promotion and deployment processes, automating previously manual code reviews, security testing, and deployment.  

LIMS-EV funding supports the ability to more effectively work in the cloud environment and to exploit emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities, extend access to mobile users, expand the amount of data accessible, and incorporate more predictive capabilities into the current reporting capability. This will extend existing BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis, mobile applications and better integrate functionality based on priority requirements as defined/approved by the A4 governance bodies.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver our integrated logistics capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $5.034 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) capability provides a Business Intelligence (BI) and Decision Support (DS) solution for the A4 community.  USAF decision-makers, maintainers and planners require increased access to comprehensive data related to platform mission, operational status, support equipment availability and parts.  This data is required to be accessible in a number different configurations ranging from preformatted executive dashboards to highly customizable ad-hoc reporting to enable improved decision making based on accurate, near-real-time data available in a simple self-service environment that provides detailed supply chain data from lowest levels all the way up to operational planners and senior leadership.  By aggregating and exposing data from over 130 data sources, LIMS-EV provides warfighters with timely, authoritative information to make informed decisions.
The LIMS-EV capability is migrating, along with the rest of AF Data Services, from GCSS-AF heritage to a commercial government cloud-configured environment.  That move will result in improved performance, greater scalability and reliability, enhanced ability to leverage Software as a Service (SAAS), and reduced operational costs from utilization of common infrastructure.  This move will also result in implementation of new system engineering processes based on agile software development/rapid prototyping via the CCE 2.0 dev/test/production environments and Data Services development laboratories and will leverage cloud best practices including streamlined promotion and deployment processes, automating previously manual code reviews, security testing, and deployment.  
LIMS-EV funding supports the ability to more effectively work in the cloud environment and to exploit emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities, extend access to mobile users, expand the amount of data accessible, and incorporate more predictive capabilities into the current reporting capability.   This will extend existing BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis, mobile applications and better integrate functionality based on priority requirements as defined/approved by the A4 governance bodies.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 57,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line (COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members.

New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following: electronic flight record, flying hour management/execution, simulator and RPA management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and additional interfaces.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ARMS capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) provides grants to the civilian academic community to conduct research on military and civilian equal opportunity issues using standard social science methodology and engineering analysis.  The research methodology and analysis includes developing a literature review proposing hypotheses and methods of research.  The grantee will then gather appropriate data, draw conclusions and present discussions, recommendations and reports based on their funding.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY17 funding request was reduced by $.269M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Funding supports Personnel Recovery development efforts to upgrade Isolated Personnel reporting devices &amp; locating systems in support of Combatant Commanders and Services. Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) developmental efforts address Personnel Recovery capability shortfalls &amp; gaps identified in the Personnel Recovery Initial Capabilities Document approved by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 120-12 on 8 Aug 2012. Activties include funding for research and development, support equipment, contract services and all associated costs specifically identified to support the JPRA headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, VA and other JPRA operating locations.

In FY16, the Common Distress Reporting System (CDRS) began development.  CDRS will integrate all personnel locating devices into the existing reporting device architecture &amp; Combat Survivor Evader Locater base stations to provide one common operating picture for timely and efficient recovery operations of isolated personnel.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides for payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.  The Department of Labor (DOL) administers this program and charges the Department of the Air Force for its employee costs; therefore, this is a MUST PAY bill for Air Force.  The Program Element(PE) excludes manpower authorizations and costs. This PE is in Budget Activity 7 in support of payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to FECA under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions. PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies from on premises data centers to a more sustainable cloud-based hosting solution and flexible services-based architecture as defined by the Defense Enterprise Service Management Framework (DESMF).  To this end, PSD executes the prototyping and development of legacy human resource systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cloud services. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver personnel administration capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In CY 2018 Cadet Administration and Information System (CAMIS) was a new start.

The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is currently in the process of modernizing its Cadet Administration and Information System (CAMIS).  CAMIS is the USAFA's primary mission system and is used for most functions related to the Cadet Lifecycle including class scheduling, grading, summer programs, performance averages, and graduation/commission requirements tracking.  This effort also includes collapsing existing CAMIS IT systems to unique, non-standard processes that remain which include the Cadet Honor System, discipline and accountability, advanced admission, and a replacement for the Cadet Logistics and Supply System (CLASS).  The largest component expected to require development includes re-designing the data warehouse to enable Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) analytic software.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies from on premises data centers to a more sustainable cloud-based hosting solution and flexible services-based architecture as defined by the Defense Enterprise Service Management Framework (DESMF).  To this end, PSD executes the prototyping and development of legacy human resource systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cloud services.  In addition, funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Personnel Services Delivery employs an evolutionary acquisition strategy to deliver incremental Information Technology, and Human Resources capabilities with development contracts that are awarded in a competitive environment. Rapid prototyping will be used to reduce technology risks, assess Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, and produce technology insertion and migration strategies. In 2015, the government conducted a Full and Open competition for Human Resources System Technical Support and awarded a contract to provide PSD with development and test/technical support. Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for PSD. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the PSD Program and provides Contracts, Legal and Comptroller support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides for development and enhancement of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools for strategic planning, operational requirements, modernization and recapitalization of systems and programs, as well as the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes for the AF Analytic Community and Secretary of the Air Force Standard Analysis Toolkit in support of AF Senior Leadership. As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.) along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range of capabilities that needs to be covered by  analytic tools needs to expand as well. M&amp;S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&amp;D challenges to field new decision support tools.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY20, PE 0901554F, DEAMS, changed from PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development.
In FY20, Project 675178, DEAMS Continuous Capability Development, changed from Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System Increment 2 (DEAMS Inc. 2).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.

There are four projects within this program element: Program and Budget Enterprise Services (PBES), Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM), Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1), and DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD), formally known as DEAMS Increment 2.

PBES is a software development effort that will utilize a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the Air Force and will replace legacy systems (Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS), and Enhanced Trade space Tool (ETT) that support the budget formulation and force programming process.

CEM is a knowledge-based study effort to improve Air Force-wide cost estimating by analyzing cost data and recommending changes to estimating models, methods, and tools.

DEAMS development will be governed in Capability Support Phase after Increment 1 Full Deployment (FD).

DEAMS is the Air Force's target core accounting and financial management solution and is a key component of the long-term business process improvements needed to sustain auditability and correct financial system weaknesses.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>PBES will be the single solution software development effort to deliver planning, programming, budgeting and execution (PPBE) capability for the United States Air Force. PBES will replace legacy systems such as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES), Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and the Enhanced Tradespace Tool (ETT), supporting the budget formulation and force programming process. Upon full deployment of PBES, the system will be compliant with the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) conventions, which will enable data standardization across the Department of Defense (DoD).

Utilizing Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), the Air Force has designated PBES as the solution to deliver traceability of financial data in support of the PPBE process. Through the use of BPR, PBES will address excessive overhead, outdated business practices and other time-consuming support activities. PBES will make the budget formulation process more efficient by incorporating business best practices, organizing programming and budgeting personnel, as well as utilizing current technology. PBES will also eliminate checks and balances required of older technology, taking advantage of automated reconciliation services. In addition, the solution will allow the use of Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) for data exposure, resulting in more timely and accurate budget submissions to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Congress, and other internal and external customers.

A Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product has been selected as the tool of choice which will require minor configuration changes to meet the stated user requirements. This strategy requires no code changes to the actual COTS product and will drive lower support costs along with making future requirements changes easier in the out-years.  Requirements will be satisfied through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced and made available to operational users after every sprint. The Integrated Product Office construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver PBES capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PBES is a Business Category (BCAT) III program following DOD 5000.75 BCAC policy. The PBES strategy, supported by all Stakeholders, was to employ an empowered joint Program Office, Functional Community, and Senior Stakeholder group to rapidly develop, test, and deploy the Air Forces Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) capability within two years. This strategy required mutual trust and risk acceptance by all parties to be successful. Thus far, this strategy has been highly successful delivering PBES capabilities ahead of schedule and substantially under budget.  

The first step in this strategy was to utilize early risk reduction efforts (sometimes referred to as "prototyping”) to prove the capability and contractors existed to meet user's needs. This was conducted using two 6-month contract vehicles which were both completed months early, delivering several hundred user requirements. The success of these efforts led to the strategy of selecting a COTS product called Oracle Hyperion and to hire a small-business system integrator (SI). The significance in both of these is that the COTS product and the SI have both already been deployed across commercial companies and multiple DoD agencies, thus reducing the risk for implementation by the Government.

Both contract awards for the SI and Oracle licenses were made in 1QFY18, with substantial cost savings received by negotiating bulk license purchases for all AF users. The development strategy was employs agile development methods creating 4-6 week "Sprint” releases to deploy capability rapidly with substantial user feedback along the way. Fourteen total Sprints were planned across two years in an attempt to match on-going Air Force PPBE cycles. As Sprints are developed and tested, they are then deployed for operational use.

MAJCOMs will first use PBES in Oct 18, for their FY21 POM development and then submit their budget requests up to the Air Staff for their review and creation of the Air Force FY21 POM. Air Staff will primarily use PBES over the legacy system in Jan 19, with continued use throughout the FY21 POM cycle. In FY18, the AF decided to accelerate the PBES Planning application, so AF Planners will first use PBES for the FY22 Plan creation in Feb 19.  While PBES will be continually updated throughout these two years, it is also the strategy to migrate all legacy system data into PBES in manageable packages across the two years.

Full deployment of PBES is on schedule to be completed in 1QFY20. The success of this strategy can be attributed to mutual buy-in by all parties, risk acceptance that the solution will not be perfect from the start, and an understanding that not all requirements are exactly known up-front and that changes will be required continuously to be successful.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) provides and enhances Air Force-wide cost estimating capabilities by developing current cost data and estimating methods and tools, data process reengineering, data structure development, and gap filling initiatives.  In collaboration with the OSD Cost Assessment Data Enterprise (CADE) project (DoD's unified initiative to collect, organize, store, and use data more efficiently), these products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and policy directives (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of AF and DoD acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   

CEM will ensure the Air Force continuously improves cost estimating capabilities for broad cross-cutting areas, as well as specific to each weapon system type (aircraft, UAVs, ballistic missiles, tactical missiles, munitions, electronics and aircraft modifications, ground stations and automated information systems, space and launch vehicles).  Changing technologies, acquisition laws, policy directives, and initiatives drive the need to revise cost estimating processes, methods, and tools.  For example, current capability shortfalls reflect gaps in the ability to respond effectively to the laws and regulations such as the FY06 NDAA report (PL 109-163--Provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs), Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) (provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis), Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition Excellence Plan (priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process), and Office of the Secretary of Defense policy (better buying power initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will versus should cost analysis).  The CADE and CEM partnership is the lead example for AT&amp;L Better Data initiatives designed as a response to Congressional expressed desire for better outcomes in acquisition.  The partnership provides data/analysis/methods/tools and institutional knowledge at the analysts' fingertips versus the status quo inefficient, ad hoc approach.

This project will perform knowledge-based studies to include analyzing historical data and changing technologies/programmatics to develop new estimating methods (e.g. statistical tools, cost estimating relationships) across hundreds of product work breakdown structure elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type noted above.  Examples of areas of cost studies and modeling efforts that cut across all weapon system types are directed energy costs, software cost datasets and metrics; contract or engineering change order studies, analysis, and models; other government cost data, methods, and analysis tools (e.g., depot standup and government test); reliability and maintainability trends and impacts on cost; and fixed price contract performance.

CEM will deliver valuable analytical tools in support of higher quality/credible estimates (as required by statute and regulation) allowing for more realistic cost conscious decisions on over $100B of critical warfighter capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY20, Project 675178, DEAMS Continuous Capability Development, changed from Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System Increment 2 (DEAMS Inc. 2).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.  

The remaining DEAMS Increment 1 development activities will be completed using agile software development methodologies under a project called DEAMS Rapid Acquisition.  As a Section 873 Agile Pilot program, Rapid Acquisition will also be a stepping stone in the implementation of agile development methodologies for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD).  Under Rapid Acquisition, the program contracted with a new System Integrator (SI) to sustain the DEAMS R12 baseline, develop the remaining Inc. 1 requirements (disbursing, reporting, Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), and provide continual enhancement and improvement to the deployed system, utilizing agile software development.

DEAMS CCD capabilities will be implemented utilizing an agile software development methodology. Requirements for CCD include, but are not limited to, development of the core accounting and reporting functionality necessary to enable deployment of modernized personnel, contracting, and logistics systems. Additional capabilities under requirements definition include complex acquisition management, reimbursable cost accounting, military entitlement accounting, advanced accounting controls and audit sustainment, treasury cash accountability, and management accounting and billing for revolving funds. Included in these capabilities are selected requirements deferred from Increment 1. 

Requirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced after every sprint. The PMO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.

Additional user deployments enabled by future increment capabilities include acquisition program executive offices; ranges, laboratories and test centers; and air logistics centers. CCD adds an additional 4,600 users to the Inc 1 baseline for a total of 21,500 users.

This funding request will support development of the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) compliance information artifacts and plans necessary to support the program, Capability Process Maps (CPMs) for each business capability, and mapping of financial management processes the capability will require (Blueprinting). Additionally, the funding will support acquisition strategy planning by early identification/definition of Information Technology Functional Requirements (ITFRs) and Information Assets (IA), Acquisition Strategy Determination, Solution Approach, and Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation. 

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD) acquisition strategy will leverage experience gained from FY19 NDAA Section 869 Pilot Program activities and from agile software development efforts in Increment 1. CCD will be implemented using an agile methodology approach following the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC). DEAMS will be in the Capability Sustainment Phase 5 (per DOD Instruction 5000.75) and will conduct continual enhancement/process improvements for the life of the program. DEAMS will continue technical support services for requirements definition and analysis and System Integrator request for proposal (RFP) development, and continue acquisition planning and support for first set of agile development epics supporting CCD system capabilities.

CCD will deliver functionality at earliest opportunity on a stable Increment 1 baseline. User experience and mission impact will be taken into account when establishing the release battle rhythm to the operational system. Factors for software releases include:
- Budget formulation and justification cycles
- End of year financial closeout
- Interdependencies with enterprise business systems
- Higher DOD requirements
- On-going development efforts with LOG-IT, CON-IT, MRO, AFIPPS, and other legacy systems
- Interfaces/data standards changes
- Changes to hosting, deployment technologies, or strategies to optimize system security, performance, and cost savings</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY20, PE 0901554F, DEAMS, changes from PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS user deployments include:
- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
- U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio
- Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) (Incremental Deployments)
- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs
 
On 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increment. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Inc 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. (FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.)

The remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes the Oracle e-Business Suite R12 upgrade and development and deployment of the remaining Increment 1 capabilities (disbursing, reporting, and Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), as well as enhancements and improvements to the existing baseline.  In accordance with the FY19 NDAA, DEAMS is an Agile Pilot program as defined in Sec 873 of the FY18 NDAA, and all remaining development will be accomplished using agile software development methodologies.

DEAMS Inc 1 is developing capability which allows for deployment to the remaining user locations.  However, DEAMS has also begun transitioning the support of previously deployed locations to the Operation and Support (O&amp;S) phase.

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>DEAMS Inc 1 capability development activities support multiple software releases and user deployments as described in the mission description. Development activities include design, build, test, data conversion, reporting, cutover from legacy systems, and the resolution of deficiency reports and defects.
Activities also include hardware support (system administration and database security) and storage service by Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA); continued development of interface to Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF); Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Common Computing Environment (CCE); Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V); Developmental Release Field Support (DRFS) to include process execution and data scripts; help desk support; Engineering Integration Services (EIS) for oversight of development tools and processes; deployment training and change management activities. Provides acquisition, contract, finance, and cost management planning and Program Management Administration (PMA) utilizing an agile approach for reporting, disbursing, and auditing initiatives.
Develop, using an Agile software development approach, the Disbursing Initiative (includes modernizing disbursing and implementing daily reconciliation with the U.S. Treasury, which will manage the receipt and acceptance of agreements, orders, and invoices), the Reporting Initiative (establish a modernized Business Intelligence reporting solution), and the Segregation of Duties (SOD) Initiative (allow DEAMS to meet regulatory compliance requirements associated with Financial Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM)).

                                <r2:Description>The T&amp;E process will be a complete system operational test to determine DEAMS effectiveness, suitability, and mission capability using the R12 Upgrade. It begins with validation of requirements and end to end functional capabilities including compliance mandates. The T&amp;E effort are conducted in developer sites, Air Force test sites, DISA production sites, and user locations. The DEAMS Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), Lead Developmental Test Organization (LDTO) Integrated Test Plan (ITP), System Integrators (SIs) Software Test Plans (STPs), and Operational Test Agency (OTA) operational test plans covers the details of Increment 1 T&amp;E. Database Administrator (DBA) Test Support required to service test instances. Capabilities Integration Environment (CIE) Integration/Development support for ancillary Test activities required. Hardware and software required for test activities.
The T&amp;E effort for the Agile Pilot Program includes Sprint Testing where functionality developed code in the sprint is tested for conformance to functional and non-functional requirements. Sprint Testing shall address unit and integrated testing.  Additionally, there will be Regression Testing to validate that the work within the sprint has not introduced defects into areas of the product not directly impacted by the work of the sprint and has not introduced defects into cross-product dependencies such as interfaces.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DEAMS Inc 1 is over 87% deployed as the baseline viable product for the AF operational finance community. The program relies on heavy customer involvement through the functional management office to govern system changes, requirements development, and day-to-day customer support. DEAMS will employ multiple contract actions as the various Development Activities and Releases are developed, tested, and deployed through FY 2020.

DEAMS Inc 1 accelerated deployment to Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Education &amp; Training Command (AETC), and AF Reserve Command (AFRC) tenant users from FY20 to FY19. This user base was orphaned from ACC, AETC, and AFRC because they reside on bases owned by other Major Commands.

AF Space Command and AF Materiel Command Incremental users at the base operations level will migrate to DEAMS Inc 1 capability in FY20 as planned.

In the FY19 NDAA, DEAMS was selected as an FY18 NDAA Sec 873 Agile Pilot program.  To facilitate the transition from traditional to agile software development, Increment 1 development items will be completed under a new rapid acquisition contract action using agile software development methods. This new effort will also inform and facilitate the agile program implementation for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.

There are two projects within this program element: Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1), and DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD), formerly known as DEAMS Increment 2. Project 675178: DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD) started in FY19 under PE 0901538F. Project 675179: DEAMS Increment 1 was under PE 0901538F through FY19.

The Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. The DEAMS implementation will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). DEAMS is a key enabler and provides the core accounting system for all enterprise business system development necessary to sustain financial statement auditability.

DEAMS enhancements will be governed in Capability Support Phase after Increment 1 Full Deployment (FD).

DEAMS is the Air Force's target core accounting and financial management solution and is a key component of the long-term business process improvements needed to sustain auditability and correct financial system weaknesses.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY20, Project 675178, DEAMS Continuous Capability Development, changed from Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System Increment 2 (DEAMS Inc. 2).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

The remaining DEAMS Increment 1 development activities will be completed using agile software development methodologies under a project called DEAMS Rapid Acquisition.  In FY19, DEAMS CCD was added to the FY18 NDAA, as a Section 873 Agile Pilot program, Rapid Acquisition will also be a stepping stone in the implementation of agile development methodologies for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD).  Under Rapid Acquisition, the program contracted with a new System Integrator (SI) to sustain the DEAMS R12 baseline, develop the remaining Inc. 1 requirements (disbursing, reporting, Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), and provide continual enhancement and improvement to the deployed system, utilizing agile software development.

DEAMS CCD capabilities will be implemented utilizing an agile software development methodology. Requirements for CCD include, but are not limited to, development of the core accounting and reporting functionality necessary to enable deployment of modernized personnel, contracting, and logistics systems. Additional capabilities under requirements definition include complex acquisition management, reimbursable cost accounting, military entitlement accounting, advanced accounting controls and audit sustainment, treasury cash accountability, and management accounting and billing for revolving funds. Included in these capabilities are selected requirements deferred from Increment 1. 

Requirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced after every sprint. The PMO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.

Additional user deployments enabled by future increment capabilities include acquisition program executive offices; ranges, laboratories and test centers; and air logistics centers. CCD adds an additional 4,600 users to Inc 1 baseline for a total of 21,500 users.

This funding request will support development of the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) compliant information artifacts and plans necessary to support the program, Capability Process Maps (CPMs) for each business capability, and mapping of financial management processes the capability will require (Blueprinting). Additionally, the funding will support acquisition strategy planning by early identification/definition of Information Technology Functional Requirements (ITFRs) and Information Assets (IA), Acquisition Strategy Determination, Solution Approach, and Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation.

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DEAMS expects to leverage lessons learned during the Increment I rapid acquisition to develop a T&amp;E process that is more complimentary to the Agile software development process. Development activities include requirements analysis, design, build, test, data conversion, cut-over from legacy systems, and the resolution of deficiency reports and defects. Also includes the support services (product development support, solution architecture support, configuration control and management support, quality assurance support, acquisition strategy support, test planning support, and cybersecurity support) of various Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;ASs), Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DEAMS Continuous Capability Development (CCD) acquisition strategy will leverage experience gained from FY19 NDAA Section 869 Pilot Program activities and from agile software development efforts in Increment 1. CCD will be implemented using an agile methodology approach following the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC). DEAMS will be in the Capability Sustainment Phase 5 (per DOD Instruction 5000.75) and will conduct continual enhancement/process improvements for the life of the program. DEAMS will continue technical support services for requirements definition and analysis and System Integrator request for proposal (RFP) development, and continue acquisition planning and support for first set of agile development epics supporting CCD system capabilities.

CCD will deliver functionality at earliest opportunity on a stable Increment 1 baseline. User experience and mission impact will be taken into account when establishing the release battle rhythm to the operational system. Factors for software releases include:
- Budget formulation and justification cycles
- End of year financial closeout
- Interdependencies with enterprise business systems
- Higher DOD requirements
- On-going development efforts with LOG-IT, CON-IT, MRO, and AFIPPS
- Interfaces/data standards changes
- Changes to hosting, deployment technologies, or strategies to optimize system security, performance, and cost savings</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS user deployments include:
- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
- U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio
- Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) (Incremental Deployments)
- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs

On 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increment. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Inc 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. (FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.)

The remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes the Oracle e-Business Suite R12 upgrade and development and deployment of the remaining Increment 1 capabilities (disbursing, reporting, and Governance/Risk/Compliance (GRC)), as well as enhancements and improvements to the existing baseline.  In accordance with the FY19 NDAA, DEAMS is an Agile Pilot program as defined in Sec 873 of the FY18 NDAA, and all remaining development will be accomplished using agile software development methodologies.

DEAMS Inc 1 is developing capability which allows for deployment to the remaining user locations. However, DEAMS has also begun transitioning previously deployed locations to the Operation and Support (O&amp;S) phase.

Funds may be used to develop, acquire, and integrate hardware and software solutions to provide improvements and enhancements in support of the development of the DEAMS capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information systems capabilities.

                                <r2:Description>The T&amp;E process will be a complete system operational test to determine DEAMS effectiveness, suitability, and mission capability using the R12 Upgrade. It begins with validation of requirements and end to end functional capabilities including compliance mandates. The T&amp;E effort are conducted in developer sites, Air Force test sites, DISA production sites, and user locations. The DEAMS Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), Lead Developmental Test Organization (LDTO) Integrated Test Plan (ITP), System Integrators (SIs) Software Test Plans (STPs), and Operational Test Agency (OTA) operational test plans covers the details of Increment 1 T&amp;E. Database Administrator (DBA) Test Support required to service test instances. Capabilities Integration Environment (CIE) Integration/Development support for ancillary Test activities required. Hardware and software required for test activities.
The T&amp;E effort for the Agile Pilot Program includes Sprint Testing where functionality developed code in the sprint is tested for conformance to functional and non-functional requirements. Sprint Testing shall address unit and integrated testing.  Additionally, there will be Regression Testing to validate that the work within the sprint has not introduced defects into areas of the product not directly impacted by the work of the sprint and has not introduced defects into cross-product dependencies such as interfaces.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DEAMS Inc 1 is over 87% deployed as the baseline viable product for the AF operational finance community. The program relies on heavy customer involvement through the functional management office to govern system changes, requirements development, and day-to-day customer support. DEAMS will employ multiple contract actions as the various Development Activities and Releases are developed, tested, and deployed through FY20.

DEAMS Inc 1 accelerated deployment to Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Education &amp; Training Command (AETC), and AF Reserve Command (AFRC) tenant users from FY20 to FY19. This user base was orphaned from ACC, AETC, and AFRC only because they reside on bases owned by other Major Commands.

AF Space Command and AF Materiel Command Incremental users at the base operations level will migrate to DEAMS Inc 1 capability in FY20 as planned.

In the FY19 NDAA, DEAMS was nominated to be an FY18 NDAA Sec 873 Agile Pilot program.  To facilitate the transition from traditional to agile software development, Increment 1 development items will be completed under a new rapid acquisition contract action using agile software development methods. This new effort will also inform and facilitate the agile program implementation for DEAMS Continuous Capability Development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, PE 0301017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), Project 675368, GSIN (Global Integrated Sensor Network), efforts were transferred to PE 1201017F, Global Sensor Integrated on Network (GSIN), Project Project 675368, GSIN (Global Integrated Sensor Network), for more accurate classification of work.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. 

The Nation's strategic C2 sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN developed and established a unified schema that integrates disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables existing radars and sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.

GSIN directly supports USSTRATCOM and other COCOMs and MAJCOM mission sets. GSIN meshes together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Repurposing these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. GSIN enables creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing realtime collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. GSIN also improves Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability and provides this data for the larger space order of battle capabilities. GSIN dramatically improves the ingestion of nontraditional, but readily available, non-US government and commercial data to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) catalog managed by the 18SPCC at Vandenberg AFB. GSIN addresses NORTHCOM/STRATCOM's signed Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) ST-0010 request for uninterrupted traditional and non-traditional sensor data integration and the Global Threat Characterization Assessment (GTCA) Operational Planning Team report. GSIN provides critical and unique data to the large AFSPC SSA data repositories to facilitate the large Space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) suite of capabilities/programs. Finally, GSIN provides Machine Learner and Data Analysis functions to optimize and operate situational awareness in the field.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GSIN weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F,0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Beginning in FY20, the Space Analysis and Application Development program and the Joint Navigation Warfare Center will be reported under the newly created PE 1202140F, USSPACECOM.  Leaving only the Data Integration and Fusion Center and the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program being reported under PE 1201921F.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The USSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace. Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.  The DIFC efforts at COCOM sponsored experimentation events will inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations.

The USSTRATCOM Defense Critical Infrastructure Protection program (DCIP) is a risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to USSTRATCOM and other DoD missions.  Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links. DCIP is directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense &amp; Americas' Security Affairs) [OASD (HD&amp;ASA)].  DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program that includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk, restore capability in the event of loss or degradation, support incident management, and protect defense critical infrastructure.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navigation Warfare (Navwar) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  Funds are used to create and maintain NAVWAR knowledge. Navwar expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs). GYPSY POFA's are linked to Combatant Commander's (CCMD) Tier 1 exercises and provide operational realistic threat-representative, GPS-contested environments for analytical assessment of air, ground, maritime, space &amp; cyberspace mission capability.  MODORD to OPERATION OLYMPIC DEFENDER calls for the execution of GPS-contested environments as part of the Joint Combat Capability in Contested Environment Assessments (JC3EA).  FORTUNE POFAs are PNT capability and vulnerability assessments associated with a Service exercise or mission event.  PRISM POFAs encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific CCMD and/or service exercises or mission events.  Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater Navwar threat environments. JNWC assesses Department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment IAW DoDI 4650.08.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) conducts PRISM, FORTUNE, and GYPSY operational field assessments on an on-going, annual basis.

PRISM events encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific Combatant Command and/or Service exercise or mission event.  

FORTUNE events are Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) vulnerability field assessments and are small scale technical risk assessments or can be risk reduction events for larger GYPSY events.

GYPSY events are larger than FORTUNE PNT related events and involve other coalition partners, and multiple US services in direct support of Geographic Combatant Command requirements. 

JNWC uses the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) program, administered by USD (AT&amp;L). Requirements dictate which MRTFB facility will be contracted to host a GYPSY or FORTUNE event.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The USSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace. Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.  The DIFC efforts at COCOM sponsored experimentation events will inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations.

The Space Analysis and Application Development program Integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&amp;S tools. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Space Analysis and Application Development program Integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&amp;S tools. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Prior to the FY20 PB cycle, The Space Analysis and Application Development Program (WSC 67A011) and the Joint Navigation and Warfare Center (WSC 672486) were reported under PE 1201921F, Service Support to STRATCOM - Space Activities.  Beginning in FY20, the programs will be reported under the newly created PE 1202140F, Service Support to U.S. SPACECOM Activities</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Analysis and Application Development program integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&amp;S tools. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations.

Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  Funds are used to create and maintain NAVWAR knowledge. NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs). GYPSY POFA's are linked to Combatant Commander's (CCMD) Tier 1 exercises (USSTRATCOM's Global Lightning and Global Thunder are examples) and provide operational realistic threat-representative, GPS-contested environments for analytical assessment of air, ground, maritime, space &amp; cyberspace mission capability.  FORTUNE POFAs are PNT capability and vulnerability assessments associated with a Service exercise or mission event.  PRISM POFAs encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific CCMD and/or service exercises or mission events.  Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater NAVWAR threat environments. JNWC assesses Department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment IAW DoDI 4650.08.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  Funds are used to create and maintain NAVWAR knowledge. NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs). GYPSY POFA's are linked to Combatant Commander's (CCMD) Tier 1 exercises (USSTRATCOM's Global Thunder and Global Lightning are examples) and provide operational realistic threat-representative, GPS-contested environments for analytical assessment of air, ground, maritime, space &amp; cyberspace mission capability.  FORTUNE POFAs are PNT capability and vulnerability assessments associated with a Service exercise or mission event.  PRISM POFAs encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific CCMD and/or service exercises or mission events.  Assessments inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations in the anticipated theater NAVWAR threat environments. JNWC assesses department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment IAW DoDI 4650.08.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to the FY20 PB cycle, The Space Analysis and Application Development Program was reported under PE 1201921F, WSC 67A011.  Beginning in FY20, the program will be reported under the newly created PE 1202140F, Service Support to U.S. SPACECOM Activities

This is NOT a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Analysis and Application Development program Integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&amp;S tools. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP increases warfighter effectiveness through the exploitation of national capabilities and promotes cross-domain integration of these capabilities into military operations/training and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

AF TENCAP exploits existing air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping and providing capability demonstrations. Projects are designed to transition to warfighters or national intelligence agencies for operational use, and to appropriate acquisition Programs of Record for sustainment and further development. AF TENCAP projects influence the design and operation of current and future air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and NTISR systems while providing situational awareness to warfighters, national intelligence agency organizations, and units.

The program consists of multiple small projects supporting one of the Air Force Core Function Mission Areas (CFMAs). Projects are executed to provide continued support to Special Operations Forces and the warfighter, with impacts at the national, operational, and tactical levels.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF TENCAP capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies. Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via AF TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements. The U.S. Government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, sustainment and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by AF TENCAP.

AF TENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. AF TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program teams to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue the following segment which mitigates cost and schedule risk.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FAB-T project replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and Nation Voice Conferencing (PNVC). FAB-T will provide the new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (ESP) Satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations. The Air Force will continue development of the FAB-T Command Post Terminal (CPT), performing activities to meet current and future emerging SATCOM requirements. 

The Force Element Terminal (FET) project provides secure, protected, and survivable communications for the strategic and tactical warfighter through airborne based MILSATCOM terminals, The FET will provide the B-52, and RC-135 aircraft with worldwide nuclear and non-nuclear survivable, anti-jam Low Probability of Detect (LPD)/Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), data and voice communications. The FET will be interoperable with Milstar, AEHF, Enhanced Polar Systems - Recapitalization (EPS-R), and Evolved Strategic SATCAM (ESS) Satellite constellations utilizing both Low Data Rate (LDR) and Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveforms.  

The PNVC capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and communications (NC3) System. PNVC is the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) replacement capability which provides anti-jam, anti-scintillation, survivable, and endurable voice communications through the AEHF satellite system for national and strategic users. There are several components being developed and procured by other organizations that must be synchronized to expeditiously field the capability. The PNVC Integrator is responsible for end-to-end integration of these components, to include requirements traceability, end-to-end system testing, configuration and checkout activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identification of deficiencies in overall PNVC system capability, enterprise and life cycle support for PNVC components. The AFPEO-SP approved entry into the acquisition lifecycle as post MS-A ACAT III Program of Record in January 2016. Starting in December 2018 PNVC Integrator is responsible for all program elements' requests for funding related to the Defense Information Systems and Agency (DISA) components of the PNVC System in accordance with FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Sec. 1661.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $12.154 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Reduce Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminal (FAB-T) Force Element Terminal (FET) saved $29.700M in FY 2020.  Reduce Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminal (FAB-T) Force Element Terminal (FET) description:  Redirects an identified FY 2020 excess in RDT&amp;E funding to programs aligned with the National Defense Strategy for improvement of lethality, such as Kill Chain Automation.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FAB-T Acquisition Strategy:  In FY 2012, the government restructured the FAB-T development program to introduce competition into the acquisition strategy in order to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon). The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon. Development and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals continued with Raytheon. The first Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project is not a New Start.  In FY 2020 PE 1203001F, the PNVC effort in Project 672490 transferred to PE 1203001F, Project 673035, PNVC, for additional transparency. 

The PNVC capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System. PNVC is the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) replacement capability which provides anti-jam, anti-scintillation, survivable, and endurable voice communications through the AEHF satellite system for national and strategic users.  There are several components being developed and procured by other organizations that must be synchronized to expeditiously field this capability.  The PNVC Integrator is responsible for end-to-end integration of these components, to include requirements traceability, end-to-end system testing, configuration and checkout activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identification of deficiencies in overall PNVC system capability, enterprise and life cycle support for PNVC components.  The AFPEO/SP approved entry into the acquisition lifecycle as a post MS-A ACAT III Program of Record in January 2016.  Starting in December 2018, PNVC Integrator is responsible for all program elements' requests for funding related to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) components of the PNVC System in accordance with FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Sec. 1661.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project is not a New Start. In FY 2020, PE 1203001F, Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, Project 673040, Force Element Terminal efforts were transferred from PE 1203001F, PE Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, Project 672490, Family of Advanced Beyond Line of Sight Terminals to provide program transparency.

The Force Element Terminal (FET) program provides secure, protected, and survivable communications for the strategic and tactical warfighter through airborne based MILSATCOM terminals.  The FET  will provide the B-52, and RC-135 aircraft with worldwide nuclear and non-nuclear survivable, anti-jam, Low Probability of Detect (LPD)/Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), data and voice communications. The FET will be interoperable with Milstar, AEHF, Enhanced Polar Systems - Recapitalization (EPS-R), and Evolved Strategic SATCOM (ESS) Satellite constellations utilizing both Low Data Rate (LDR) and Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveforms.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $12.154 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB &amp; Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for over 170 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&amp;D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control. During FY 2018 the AFSCN supported 10 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $3.6B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. In FY 2018, the AFSCN supported 19 launches delivering $13.7B worth of satellites to their operational orbits. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence Community, and civil users. These efforts support cyber hardening, Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO-S) and and Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) activities for the space enterprise, as well as align with the evolving future space domain demands through Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG) to include transmit and receive, and data transport.

Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC) - Satellite Anomaly Recovery and Support Upgrade; Enhanced High-Power Amplifier (EHPA): The Air Force will complete development testing of the EHPA first article. The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system. The EHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue through the 2020s.

AFSCN Deficiency Resolution: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.  

Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG): Provides the means to communicate with all future spacecraft through diverse antenna networks. The program is pursuing more capable ground based antennas, augmenting the existing ASFCN with commercial antennas, upgrading satellite scheduling to commercial standards, and cyber security.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFSCN weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Funding supports cyber hardening and Defensive Cyberspace Operations for Space (DCO-S) activities for the space enterprise.  Provides space enterprise defensive cyber solutions to counter advanced persistence cyber threats, through rapid fielding of operational prototypes using DevSecOps methods.

This is not a new start.  This effort initially started under each of the AFSCN major thrusts has evolved into a space enterprise-wide effort and consequently is being broken out as a separate major thrust to provide additional efficiency and transparency. This effort implements a combined Development/Operations (DEVOPS) framework which incorporates methodologies, technologies, and tools to deeply embed security best practices into the modern development workflow and toolchain. This effort will institute four product lines: Manticore (detect), Pegasus (protect), Chimera (identify), and Kraken (respond).  The DCO-S capabilities are developed and deployed as an agile program, leveraging a DEVOPS framework to facilitate rapid and timely fielding to operations.</r2:Description>

The SE&amp;I contractor maintains the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) architecture and requirements baseline for Government approval and may perform studies to determine Government options.  Limited RDT&amp;E will be applied to the Consolidated Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Modifications, Maintenance, and Operations (CAMMO) contract when sustaining engineering expertise is needed to finalize Government-approved architectures. FFRDC technical depth and breadth will be leveraged to ensure AFSCN modernization efforts are compatible with mission rules and do not pose a risk to safe and cost-effective satellite contacts.

Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG) activities will leverage existing prototypes and risk reduction activities. The Air Force plans to pursue the use of FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act section 804, Middle Tier Rapid Prototyping and section 815, Other Transaction Authority for Resilient Enterprise Ground.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020 and beyond, the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) Project 673140 has been transferred to a dedicated Program Element (1206770F).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of prototype experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) and the Mobile Range Flight (MRF) at Kirtland, NM and at Schriever AFB, CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible for transitions of designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs.  In addition, RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as AFSPC transitions to an Enterprise-based ground C2.  Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.

The primary objective of the MMSOC C2/GSE environment is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D, prototype and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard hardware and software infrastructure to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations;(3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new satellite and C2 systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and legacy satellite missions. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space enterprise.

This program previously contained the EGS project as part of the evolving current and future space domain. MMSOC capability will transition to become the EGS C2 product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems. The RDSMO program will continue to support all mission sets described above as the EGS capability becomes the primary ground C2 system for AFSPC and other users. 

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver warfighting space capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of prototype experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) and the Mobile Range Flight (MRF) at Kirtland, NM and at Schriever AFB, CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible transitions for designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs.  In addition, RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as AFSPC transitions to an Enterprise-based ground C2.  Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.

The primary objective of the MMSOC C2/GSE environment is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D, prototype and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard hardware and software infrastructure to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations;(3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new satellite and C2 systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and legacy satellite missions. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2020 and beyond, the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) Project 673140 has been transferred to a dedicated Program Element (1206770F).

The Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) program is part of the evolving current and future space domain demands. MMSOC capability will transition to become the EGS command and control (C2) product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and  resiliency in space program ground systems. The EGS capability will become the primary ground C2 system for AFSPC and other users.

The main objective of the EGS is to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. EGS will focus efforts on developing and integrating data centers in laboratories at three separate sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cybersecurity development and implementation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The EGS acquisition strategy focuses on rapidly delivering C2 prototypes and operational capabilities to warfighters, while leveraging industry best practices for agile development and continuous integration /deliver (CI/CD). One of the key tenets of the EGS acquisition strategy is to maintain government ownership of the technical baseline. As a result, EGS uses a combination of existing and new contracts, and agreements with industry and academia to procure prototypes, platform as a service (PaaS) capabilities, system engineering services, and pre-operations support for mission users. Leverage existing contracts in FY19 and continue consolidation of contracts into FY 2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Located at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development (SIIRTD) program develops and modifies modeling and simulation tools that Air Force Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Space Training Simulators develop and upgrades space training emulators using Standard Space Trainer (SST) to meet Space Mission Force (SMF) threat-based, advanced training requirements as well as funds connection to Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)training networks. Finally, its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.  

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SIIRTD weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

The FY2020 funding request was reduced by $0.928M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Key models include the Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM). This is an Air Force process that harnesses disparate domain capabilities into a simulation environment. Threat, Vulnerability, Timeline (TVT) is a tool underpinning key POM decisions, overlaying force structure on the given threat constructs to identify warfighting shortfalls. The Program's mission/campaign modeling suites must be updated to produce technically sound and responsive space analyses for warfighter operations in a highly-contested environment. These tools assess how well we meet national and military needs identified by the Enterprise Space Architecture Office (ESAO) and Joint Space Warfighter Forum (JSWF). The Space Surveillance Network Analysis Model (SSNAM) is a key warfighting tool supporting the JFSCC's operation centers' situational awareness. As a major warfighting domain, it is critical we establish the tool to accurately represent space.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2020, Integrated Broadcast Service PE1203179F effort transfer to PE0305179F due to realignment to Major Force Program for Intelligence and Communications.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The IBS fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

IBS is comprised of the following:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF (Ultra High Frequency) satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a Military Standard (MIL-STD) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 
- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), all built to validated warfighter requirements.
-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

This PE funds:
- Development/upgrades of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF) 

This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver IBS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space.  LTRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA. LTRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  LTRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, LTRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are designated as Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).

LTRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing &amp; Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.

As aging range systems exhibit decreasing reliability, leading to higher operations and maintenance costs and increasing the risk of launch delays, the Air Force requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct architecture analyses to optimize investment planning for safety of flight (such as the use of drones, high definition optics, phased-array radars etc.) and commercial launch.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LTRS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Due to the fielded LTRS age and obsolescence issues, many systems need to be replaced (e.g. communications systems at ER &amp; WR). These major modifications will be competed, typically among small business contractors, and selected through best value source selections. The competitively-selected SE&amp;I contractor manages government-controlled requirements and processes as well as provide support to the "government as the integrator" between LTRS Integrated Support Contract (LISC) and separately competed modernization projects. FFRDC provides mission assurance oversight to ensure capabilities meet operational need.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common-grid three- dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures, and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec. 50112, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitate international cooperation.

The system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under Program Element (PE) 1203164F), Space (funded under this PE and PE 1203269F) and a Control Network (funded under PE 1203165F and PE 1206423F). The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters (spherical error probable) worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense- Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.

GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in PE 1203265F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) signal, enhanced anti-jam power. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production &amp; Deployment Phase.

PE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of GPS III SVs 01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect United States (U.S.) military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).

Starting in FY 2019, PE 1203269F funds the RDT&amp;E of GPS IIIF (SVs 11-12), which will include Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support efforts. GPS IIIF includes design activity, risk-reducing simulators, and systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS IIIF SVs, including backward compatibility, dual band Telemetry, Tracking, and Control (TT&amp;C), integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hosted payloads, a new civil (L1C) Galileo- compatible signal, and the Regional Military Protection (RMP) capability that provides the ability to deliver high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals in specific areas of intended effect.

The Air Force (AF) is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG), which provides signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding and PE 1203265F GPS III to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.

Mission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to and after launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures and procurement of special support equipment.

GPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet the congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchases to M-Code-capable receivers starting in FY 2017. Funds in this PE will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with OCX, supports Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.

Impacts of the M-Code deployment include:
-Compliance with The Air Force Space Command Commander's mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for early M-Code operational use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effects.
-Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.
-Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.
-Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding.

The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded with this budget item help to determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance and resiliency through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation. This augmentation to the GPS constellation enables future rapid technology on-ramps with minimal risk.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS III Space Segment weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

This PE encompasses the GPS III (SVs 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY 2019, GPS IIIF Production Readiness efforts.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Search and Rescue GPS (SAR/GPS) is an approved auxiliary payload on GPS IIIF beginning no earlier than SV 11. SAR/GPS fills validated National Search and Rescue (SAR) Committee requirements to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for SAR.

In addition, the United States Air Force (USAF) has on-going requirements to rescue US Military personnel in harm's way per AF Doctrine Document 2-1.6. The implementation of a U.S. Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) SAR Space Segment is via a Canadian-provided 406 MHz SAR repeater on GPS IIIF SVs. This system presents a cost effective, low-risk opportunity that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. Per National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-39, USAF and United States Coast Guard (USCG), the U.S. operators of the civil Cosmicheskaya Sistyema Poiska Avariynich Sudov-Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (COSPAS/SARSAT) system, and the international SAR system will integrate the Canadian provided SAR repeater into GPS IIIF beginning no earlier than SV 11.

SAR/GPS funds were transferred to GPS III SPAF beginning in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Space Analysis and Application Development M-Code Hosted Payload will provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation. The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses funded in this project will determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance and resiliency through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation. This augmentation to the GPS constellation enables future rapid technology on-ramps with minimal risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS III is the next-generation SV supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in PE 1203265F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production &amp; Deployment Phase.

PE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports RDT&amp;E of GPS III SVs 01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This program includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS OCX program.

Mission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch and post launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures and procurement of special support equipment.

Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. Phase 1 will address GPS Enterprise Analysis of Alternative (AoA) recommendations to increase GPS signal strength from space by maturing navigation payload technologies that include a new regional M-Code capability. The AF is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG), which will provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with AFRL's S&amp;T funding, PE 1203265F, and PE 1203269F (starting in FY 2019) to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads.

GPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet a congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchase to M-Code-capable receivers starting in FY 2017. The funds will cover the MCEU program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with GPS OCX, supports MGUE testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.

Impacts of the M-Code deployment include:
-Compliance with The Air Force Space Command Commander's mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for early m-code operational use and verification of NAVWAR effects.
-Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.
-Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.
-Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding.

The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded by this budget item will determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation.

This PE encompasses the GPS III (SVs 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY2019, GPS III Follow-On Production Readiness efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GPS III next generation space segment (SV 01-10) rapidly and affordably responds to warfighter capability requirements. The acquisition approach utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower-risk incremental delivery of mature technologies. This approach focuses on mission success and on-time delivery. The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system, and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV capability additions.

RDT&amp;E funding for SVs 11 and 12 is in PE 1203269F, Project GPS IIIF. Beginning in FY 2020 SPAF funding for SVs 13-32 is captured in PE 1203269F, Project GPS IIIF.

The AF is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort is funded with AFRL's S&amp;T funding, PE 1203265F, and PE 1203269F (starting in FY2019) to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.

On 19 July 2016, PEO Space approved the Acquisition Strategy Document (ASD) for the COps effort. The strategy enables contingency constellation sustainment capability for GPS III PNT. GPS III COps is needed because GPS OCX will not deliver in time to support initial GPS III SV operations. COps operates (post-launch and check-out) GPS III SVs at the capability level of GPS IIR-M or GPS IIF using the existing AEP control segment.

On 21 Jan 2017, PEO Space approved the Acquisition Strategy for the MCEU program. The MCEU acquisition strategy enables the GPS Enterprise to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter prior to GPS OCX delivery. MCEU will also support the scheduled operational testing of MGUE. MCEU will update the GPS control segment software, AEP, to allow for command and control, processing, and integrity monitoring of the M-Code signal. MCEU acquires this capability by using the existing GPS III prime contract vehicle to modify the operational AEP software.

The Air Force approved reinstatement of a previously deferred Key Support Area (KSA) on 10 Feb 2016. The MSTIC receivers currently under development will get a software upgrade to process M-Code data. This $7.96M project to procure the M-MSTIC receivers was funded through both O&amp;M and SPAF funds in FY 2016-FY 2018. Performance monitoring, integration, and test will be conducted by the MCEU program and sustained under the Global Positioning Operations Support and Sustainment Division contract with Lockheed Martin.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Superiority Intelligence program provides Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Electronic Support (ES) for key find, fix, track, target, engage and assess (F2T2EA) requirements supporting Space Superiority activities meeting Combatant Command (CCMD) needs. SSI funds developmental intelligence activities to support new space superiority capability acquisition and development. Funds associated developmental ISR planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, dissemination and integration (PCPAD) capabilities providing Battlespace Awareness and SSA in support of Space Superiority and Space Control. This includes funding for fixed and transportable intelligence collection, processing/exploitation and dissemination (PED), analysis and production capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), meet Risk Management Framework Accreditation requirements and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats. It provides intelligence support systems for Space Situational Awareness activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Protection Programs by providing architectural survivability analysis of critical mission assets for mission assurance, as well as network analysis. It also supports specialized/tailored, phased threat system analysis and studies (A&amp;S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development, vulnerability, susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, and to preserve the US space advantage across all domains. 

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SSI capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $2.088 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Projects 67A030 and 67A031, JMS Infrastructure and Mission Applications, are complete in FY 2019.  The $0.001M entries in Project 67A031 in FY 2020 and FY 2022 are the result of a database error.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force is developing a Space Command and Control (C2) and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) capability for the Joint Force Space Component Commander (JFSCC). The enterprise-wide system will provide a common government infrastructure and standards for rapid prototyping of dynamic SSA and Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) applications to address the evolving and dynamic threat.  The system will provide a collaborative environment that will enhance and modernize SSA and BMC2 capabilities; create decision-relevant views of the space environment; rapidly detect, track and characterize objects of interest; identify / exploit traditional and non-traditional sources; perform space threat analysis; and enable efficient distribution of data across the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). Funding includes technical studies, development, experimentation, integration and related support costs.

In the FY 2019 budget, Project 67A035 ESBMC2 received a Congressional rescission of $30.000M.  The correct total for FY 2018 is $53.003M

In Project 67A035, Enterprise Space BMC2, the FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $30.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JMS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Prior to FY2019, the funding for the National Space Defense Center was in PE 1203940F, Space Situational Awareness Operations, Project 670004, Other STRATCOM Activities

In FY2019, PE 1203620F, National Space Defense Center, Project 67A035, Enterprise Space BMC2 efforts were transferred to PE 1203620F, National Space Defense Center, Project 670004, Other STRATCOM activities to provide program transparency.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program will develop, upgrade and field the National Space Defense Center's (NSDC) operational infrastructure integrating mission partner networks, data and other hardware and software solutions into NSDC's technical baseline.  Additionally, this program will provide for agile requirement development, and operational and developmental test activities supporting software Development in Operations (DevOps).  The NSDC allows the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events and will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community operations.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program will develop Battle Management and Command and Control (BMC2) applications for the National Space Defense Center (NSDC) (formerly Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC)).  In addition, this program will develop hardware and software prototypes to support US Strategic Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (ST-0006) for an Accelerated BMC2 capability.  The NSDC allows the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events and will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Shared Early Warning System (SEWS) is the result of Presidential foreign policy initiatives which began in 1996. The SEWS continues to provide Theater Combatant Commanders and foreign nation customers direct operational benefit by improving the architectural design and equipment thereby providing enhanced mission capabilities (i.e., expanded coverage, emerging capability integration, etc.). Foreign customer arrangements are negotiated with individual countries on a bilateral basis to provide selected region-specific missile warning information. SEWS Integration and Test facility is kept current by enhancing systems to improve analysis of real world events.  To enhance mission capability the SEWS program tests message format updates, cross domain solution updates, mandatory crypto upgrades, SEWS integration with other warning systems, and the transition to "coalition-based" warning.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

In FY 2020, no funding is requested and no funding is required as all SEWS development was completed.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SEWS capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>COBRA DANE (CD) is a 40+ year old radar located on Eareckson AS, AK (Shemya Island, AK), executing two missions: Missile Defense (MD) and Space Situational Awareness (SSA). SSA mission supports New Foreign Launches (NFLs) and Space Catalog maintenance to include space debris tracking.  CD will acquire through design, development, Integration, and test a modern architecture to enhance mission capability providing Warfighter and Stakeholder customers direct operational benefit.  CD utilizes Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I), University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) and Assistance and Advisory Services Contractors to support programmatic and technical activities.  Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Specifically,  the Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) Rehost program upgrades the CD system's radar back end mission data processing, radar management and control, and signal processing capabilities to a modern architecture that facilitates long term mission resiliency, cyber security, system viability, high operational availability, and rapid hardware and software development and deployment capability.  FY17 Above Threshold Reprograming (ATR) RDT&amp;E funds were provided to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to accelerate the joint Air Force and MDA modernization program of the CD radar which opens the door for a non-traditional acquisition approach using an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement through the OSD Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) Organization.This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Cobra Dane's weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F,0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F. In addition to funds being used to modernize this back end of the radar, these funds will also be used for out-year planning of front end component modernization including enhancement of communication elements.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in PE 0305906F, NCMC - TW/AA System.

This program element supports development activities for the current and potential future NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex - Integrated Tactical Warning Attack Assessment (NCMC-ITW/AA) system providing authorities with accurate, timely, unambiguous warning and attack assessment of air, missile and space threats.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 1203913F, project 672808, USNDS 7, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space. USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.

The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and Systems Engineering, Integration and Test
(SEI&amp;T) activities on Space Vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).

DoD funds their contribution to the USNDS program in Program Element (PE) 1203913F with Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF), and Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M).

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified
GEO host), and Space Test Platform (STP) 3. Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment, the RADEC Data Processor (RDP), and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the five deployable mobile ground segment survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental, evolutionary acquisition approach.

The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable UGNT which is funded with RDT&amp;E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The GNT supports ITW/AA and NFM missions. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System Survivable (SBIRS) / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM. The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the Mobile Ground System (MGS) mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced NUDET detection capabilities which meet survivable/ endurable attack assessment requirements directed by the President, Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.

This budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas. Sensor integration for GPS III and GPS IIIF are funded in their respective PEs.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NUDET Detection System (SPACE) weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds is in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

USNDS 7 ICADS reports endoatmospheric, transition and near-space nuclear detonations as detected by the USNDS sensors aboard the GPS satellites, DSP satellites and SABRS equipped satellites. ICADS Build 7 process NDS, State-of-Health (SOH), and navigation data from GPS IIIF. USNDS 7 UGNT provide NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/AEHF circuits. USNDS 7 also consists of the Integrated Data Denial (IDD). IDD is a Communications Security (COMSEC) device associated with the USNDS. IDD provides decryption of satellite position data and NDS sensor data used to detect, locate, and report nuclear detonations in earth's atmosphere or near-space in near real time. This IDD effort contains cryptographic modifications mandated by National Security Agency (NSA). In addition, parts obsolescence requires the start of a new IDD design and manufacturing effort.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of  all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. SSA also encompasses the integration, exploitation and delivery of data sources to facilitate the battle management and command and control of space forces.  This program element fields, upgrades, modifies, modernizes, operationalizes, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA Space Surveillance Network (SSN) while companion program element 1206425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in this program element (1203940F) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering.

Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) (Project 67A017) are efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational SSA sensors, as needed. These SLEPs extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. In addition, the SLEPs themselves may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized. As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin SLEPs on additional efforts.  These efforts may include prototyping and technology demonstrations. 

Global Sensor Watch Program provides an integrated SSA Tip and Cue capability that implements a survivable architecture that provides overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing event response, multiple level security processing of SSA data and automated cross-sensor tipping and cueing around the globe.  Other efforts to support Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) in space include developing &amp; deploying advanced software algorithms to identify, acquire, characterize, and maintain custody of deep space Super High Interest Objects (SHIO); optimizing intelligence community &amp; Missile Defense Agency sensors to better support BMC2; developing &amp; executing Joint Functional Component Command (JFCC) for Space exercises such as Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC) Experimentation, Test and Training Initiative (JETTI) to test &amp; optimize Space Control capabilities, concepts of operations (CONOPS) development to increase probability of survival for blue assets, and refining requirements across the space enterprise; enhancing sensor performance to close the solar exclusion gap by leveraging technologies such as optical daylight tracking; and improving legacy communication paths to support bi-directional machine-to-machine sensor communications enabling a more complete BMC2 capability.

Ground Based Radar Upgrades improves the sensitivity, search capabilities and CONOPS of existing ground-based SSA sensors to better support custody and fire control timelines.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $8.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Space Defense Center (NSDC), formerly the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC), seeks to improve unity of effort and information sharing across the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events. The NSDC requires effective battle management, command and control (BMC2) to integrate and synchronize space and cyber forces and the intelligence community with efforts across all domains and to execute unity of effort through the core command and control functions of:  situation monitoring, planning, decision making, space force management and space force direction.  The NSDC will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) operations. Lessons learned from NSDC experimentation will inform requirements development for future BMC2 architectures.

Beginning in FY 2019, National Space Defense Center (NSDC) funding in PE 1203940F is transferred to PE 1203620F, National Space Defense Center.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of  all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. SSA also encompasses the integration, exploitation and delivery of data sources to facilitate the battle management and command and control of space forces.  This program element fields, upgrades, modifies, modernizes, operationalizes, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA Space Surveillance Network (SSN) while companion program element 1206425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in this program element (1203940F) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering.

Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) are efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational SSA sensors. These SLEPs extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. In addition, the SLEPs themselves may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized. As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin SLEPs on additional efforts. These efforts may include prototyping and technology demonstrations.

Global Sensor Watch Program provides an integrated SSA Tip and Cue capability that implements a survivable architecture that provides overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing event response, multiple level security processing of SSA data and automated cross-sensor tipping and cueing around the globe.  Other efforts to support Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) in space include developing &amp; deploying advanced software algorithms to identify, acquire, characterize, and maintain custody of deep space Super High Interest Objects (SHIO); optimizing intelligence community &amp; Missile Defense Agency sensors to better support BMC2; developing &amp; executing Joint Functional Component Command (JFCC) for Space exercises such as Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC) Experimentation, Test and Training Initiative (JETTI) to test &amp; optimize Space Control capabilities, concepts of operations (CONOPS) development to increase probability of survival for blue assets, and refining requirements across the space enterprise; enhancing sensor performance to close the solar exclusion gap by leveraging technologies such as optical daylight tracking; and improving legacy communication paths to support bi-directional machine-to-machine sensor communications enabling a more complete BMC2 capability.

Ground Based Radar Upgrades improves the sensitivity, search capabilities and CONOPS of existing ground-based SSA sensors to better support custody and fire control timelines.

Programs and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats.  Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) distribution system which operates through all weather. GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

Program Element (PE) 1206423F funds Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) for the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI). This includes advanced concept development such as support for Regional Military Protection (RMP), systems analysis, modernized control segment development, modernization/deployment of 17 monitoring stations, mission planning development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, test resources, systems engineering required to meet the Government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification. OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations, and 4) integrate Department of Defense (DoD) information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. GPS EI is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.

OCX funds support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, resolving obsolescence issues, test and evaluation efforts, and mission operations. These activities support upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to enable efforts to protect United States (U.S.) Military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds ensure OCX efforts meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities.

The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments. The Government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, Allied, and commercial GPS users.

The GPS EI project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish critical integrating function with the three GPS enterprise material segments along with the logistics, operational and transition communities. The GPS EI maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise. Further, GPS EI provides modeling, simulation, and technical analyses of impacts for Government directed enterprise level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification.

In addition, the GPS EI project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities. Examples for Generation II include electronic protection; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection and additional civil signals. To accomplish this, GPS EI delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments. In this capacity, GPS EI is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.

GPS EI's analyses guides Government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs. For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the GPS EI: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules; and conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS EI performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The Government owns the GPS Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the GPS EI team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances Government control, oversight and program accountability.

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver OCX weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS is a space based PNT distribution system which operates through all weather. This project funds the research and development for OCX. This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment and mission planning development, modernization/deployment of 17 monitoring stations, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and test resources.

OCX acquisition was established to: 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites; 2) incorporate situational awareness to support NAVWAR and signal monitoring; 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations; and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, technology development, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future JROC approved required capabilities. 

Funding will also support new capabilities being developed by the GPS III Follow-On (GPS IIIF) production program along with RMP.  This effort will research potential impacts and develop solutions due to the GPS IIIF modifications, upgrade monitoring stations, and implement advances in collection and integration of RMP high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals.

OCX Block 0 (through Iteration 1.5) is the Launch and Control System (LCS) intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the on-orbit checkout of all GPS III satellites. OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.

OCX Block 1 (adds Iterations 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1 to Block 0) fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and civil signals (L1C/A), military signals (L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the modernized civil signal (L2C) and the aviation safety-of-flight signal (L5). In addition, Block 1 will field the basic operational capability to control the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code), and the globally compatible signal (L1C). It also fully meets information assurance/cyber defense requirements.

OCX Block 2 fields the advanced operational capability to control the advanced features of the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code). Blocks 1 &amp; 2 are being delivered concurrently as a result of the Oct 2016 Nunn-McCurdy review.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force is pursuing a "Block" approach for OCX in order to respond to warfighter capability requirements.  The strategy calls for capability (e.g., better signal maintainability, Unified S-Band (USB), Search and Rescue (SAR) GPS, and near-real time Command and Control (C2)), on-ramps for the follow-on contract for GPS III Space Vehicles (SVs) (starting no earlier than SV11) which will require updates to the OCX ground segment. Enterprise studies will ensure GPS Enterprise synchronization across space and ground segments.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS EI is responsible for technical baseline management, integration, synchronizing, testing, and verifying GPS III, OCX, Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE), M-Code Early Use (MCEU) and Contingency Operations (COps) programs that constitute the GPS Enterprise. Moreover, GPS EI is responsible for delivering a reliable PNT signal capability to military operators, the civil user community, and international partners. Similarly, the Government Joint Program Office owns and approves the technical baseline and is responsible for the successful fielding of all the GPS Segments (space, control, and user). In order to successfully execute its responsibilities, the Government relies on GPS EI's specific expertise to create an enterprise architecture, integrate segment products, and verify the enterprise requirements are adequately met.

The GPS EI is also responsible for developing and managing the Enterprise technical baseline, which reflects multiple stakeholders' requirements. Such stakeholders include the Department of Defense (DoD), foreign governments, industry, and the general public (through four public interface specifications). Furthermore, GPS EI ensures GPS capabilities meet the warfighter's, civil agencies', commercial entities', international treaties', and over four billion global GPS users' needs. The GPS EI also manages the process through which the JROC validated requirements are matured and flowed down to the system segments, while remaining consistent with various interfaces. This enables the GPS system to meet Title 10 of the USC, Sec 2281, mandated GPS capabilities, and various other obligations to the international community that provide inter-operable PNT signals. GPS EI is also responsible for all aspects of schedule and technical alignment across the segments. Additionally, GPS EI is responsible for creating and managing plans that provide early exercise of the products under development, compatibility analysis, and inter-segment testing. The inter-segment tests are required to prove OCX interoperability with GPS III satellites and modernized user equipment. More importantly, it ensures backwards compatibility with GPS Block II satellites and legacy user equipment.

GPS EI activity supports the Government Joint Program Office's GPS spectrum protection at international forums such as the International Telecommunications Union. Such support consists of advocating on behalf of the United States Government when negotiating with foreign partners. In addition, GPS EI provides technical expertise to maintain relationships with other U.S. government agencies that include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Departments of State (DOS), Transportation (DoT), Homeland Security (DHS), and Commerce (DOC).

Spectrum expertise also ensures GPS priority for eight essential spectrum signals, including those required for civil air navigation and safety of life. Spectrum Protection prevents encroachment from commercial or foreign entities, which results in the preservation of warfighter's reliable signal. As a result, military operations and the integrity of the global economic infrastructure are protected. GPS EI also provides the GPS enterprise expertise in System Safety, Enterprise level System Security Engineering covering Acquisition Systems Program Security (i.e., personnel, industrial, operations, information, sensitive compartmented information, communication, and physical), Program Protection, Foreign Disclosure, Public Release reviews, Mission System Certification and Accreditation, and Enterprise Cybersecurity. GPS EI is accountable for the development, execution, and analysis of OCX, cybersecurity, and associated test cases necessary to deliver a secure operational system.

GPS EI supports the Government development and implementation of various Systems Engineering documents, defines the methods of verification, conducts the analyses or tests, and assists the Government in conducting Integrated System Tests. In addition, GPS EI validates the system performance in various mission threat scenarios during its development. GPS EI provides in-depth technical expertise to enhance government control, oversight and program accountability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with a "back to basics" acquisition approach and the exercise of strong oversight of development contractors, the Air Force is required to exercise complete ownership of the architecture, system definition, technical baseline, and integration of the GPS space, ground, and user segments. While this complex inter- segment integration is traditionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract, for GPS, this approach requires the government to be the integrator. To execute this responsibility, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contractor. The GPS EI function of the SE&amp;I contractor is currently funded within this PE. The SE&amp;I effort was originally procured in 2007 through a full and open competition, as was the new follow-on SE&amp;I contract awarded in 2015. The SE&amp;I follow-on strategy builds in year over year cost reductions as requirements stabilize. In FY 2023, the GPS EI budget will transition from PE 1206423F to PE 1203269F.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Note: FY 2018-2019 EGS funds are allocated in the Space and Missile Test and Evaluation Center (RDSMO) Program Element (PE) 1203173F and in FY2020+ EGS funds have transferred to a new Program Element (PE) 1206770F, Project 673140, Enterprise Ground Services (EGS).

The Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) program is part of the evolving current and future space domain demands. Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) capability will transition to become the EGS command and control (C2) product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems. The EGS capability will become the primary ground C2 system for Air Force Space Enterprise.

The main objective of EGS is to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. EGS will focus efforts on developing and integrating data centers in laboratories at three separate sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cybersecurity development and implementation. Programs and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats. Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.

Over the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) EGS will be developing software applications and other services that support onboarding 23 missions covering the range of mission areas including Missile Warning, Missile Defense, MILSATCOM, Space Domain Awareness and other experimental satellites.  The modifications to core software applications provided by EGS will be made in an Agile DevSecOps environment which has and continues to be demonstrated through current EGS activities. 

Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.

The program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EGS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The EGS acquisition strategy focuses on rapidly delivering C2 prototypes and operational capabilities to warfighters, while leveraging industry best practices for agile development and continuous integration /delivery (CI/CD). One of the key tenets of the EGS acquisition strategy is to maintain government ownership of the technical baseline. As a result, EGS uses a combination of existing and new contracts, and agreements with industry and academia to procure prototypes, platform as a service (PaaS) capabilities, system engineering services, and pre-operations support for mission users. Leverage existing contracts in FY 2019 and continue consolidation of contracts into FY 2020. The intent is to award 2 SBIRS phase 3 contracts in 2nd Qtr FY 2019 to continue this consolidation and to begin scaling of the enterprise to onboard the missions post demonstration activity.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

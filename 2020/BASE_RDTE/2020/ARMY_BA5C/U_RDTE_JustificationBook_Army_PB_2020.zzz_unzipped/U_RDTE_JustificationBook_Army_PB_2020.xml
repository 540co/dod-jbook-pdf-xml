            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Current ground combat vehicle platforms and tactical wheeled vehicles within Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) lack the ability to effectively detect, track, divert, disrupt, neutralize, or destroy incoming direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  Current solutions to defeat these threats, Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Slat armor, do not provide preemptive or active protection and impose secondary blast hazards to crew, dismounted soldiers, and adjacent vehicles and equipment.  The Suite of Vehicle Protection Systems - EMD Program Element (0604852A) will develop and mature solutions to increase the protection of the Army's ground systems from both current and next generation direct or indirect fired threat munitions.  

The Active Protection System Project (XU9) will install and characterize Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Active Protection Systems on Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker demonstrator vehicles.  The Active Protection System effort will assess the maturity, performance, and integration risk of NDI Active Protection Systems, develop and refine Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker Active Protection System installation kit designs, and build prototypes necessary to conduct performance and safety testing to obtain an Active Protection System Urgent Materiel Release (UMR).  Active Protection System effort will execute installation design refinement and required testing to meet urgent fielding of NDI APS on Abrams, Bradley and Stryker pending Army leadership approval. The Active Protection System NDI effort will also serve to inform the Vehicle Protection Suite Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).

The Vehicle Protection Suite (VPS) Project (FE8) will design, mature, and evaluate combinations of active, reactive, and passive solutions and leverage both Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) principles and the Army's Modular Active protection system Controller (MAC) to develop tailored vehicle Survivability Sets that will mitigate existing protection gaps, allow for future technology insertion to meet evolving threats, and minimize the impact to the current capabilities hosted on Army ground system platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY 2018, the VPS program will initiate characterization of the MAC compliant/NDI capabilities (hardware, software, interfaces, etc.) to inform the VPS Analysis of Alternative (AoA).  The MAC compliant/NDI capabilities characterization efforts will be achieved through bailments, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), and Other Transactional Agreements (OTA) with industry partners.  The VPS AoA, informed by the Trade Study, will assess the cost, maturity, complexity, performance, and physical properties of alternative survivability sets to determine the optimal application of VPS solutions onto the Army's ground platforms.   The VPS Tranche II solutions will have a decision point in FY 2020 with contract awards for platform specific engineering efforts planned for the first quarter of  FY 2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Active Protection System Project (XU9) is a continuation of efforts previously executed under PE 0203735A - Combat Vehicle Improvement Programs.

The Active Protection System (APS) installation and characterization effort will evaluate platform (Abrams, Bradley, Stryker) performance with an Non-Developmental Item (NDI) APS solution installed.  Platform performance evaluation includes APS sensor assessments, minimum live threat characterization, surface danger zone characterization, co-site mitigation (antennas/radiators), electromagnetic interference assessment/characterization, energetic radiation assessment, and a durability assessment.  The NDI APS installation and characterization is being executed through a partnership between the US Army, NDI APS solution vendors, and prime contractors for Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker vehicles.  NDI APS vendor support, to include procurement of demonstration hardware, is contracted on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) basis, while platform prime contractor technical support is provided on a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis.  The results from the installation and characterization effort has resulted in moving forward with installation design refinement and required testing to meet urgent fielding of NDI APS on Abrams, as well as Bradley and Stryker pending Army leadership approval.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for artillery weapons systems.  

Project 509 supports the Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, which is a Joint Service program between the US Marine Corps (USMC) and US Army which provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. The LW155 was first introduced into the USMC in April 2005 and the Marines have fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) commenced in FY2014 and will continue through FY2018. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km.  It is a successful joint service program between the USMC and US Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer.  The howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system, since it has been in the field for more than ten years.   

Current development efforts are focused on extending the range of the LW155 to reduce the threat of being out ranged by potential adversaries and meeting the range key performance parameter objective distance (greater than 40km) as stated in the Joint US Army, USMC Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for Advanced Towed Cannon System, but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule.  The USMC and US Army are leveraging technology being developed as part of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program by the US Army.  The ERCA program is a suite of technologies, cannon, ammunition and fire control, to increase the range of cannon artillery to exceed peer competitors range (greater than 70km).  An operational assessment of the M777 Extended Range (M777ER) howitzer will be conducted at the end of FY2020 to assess the performance of best available projectiles and objective hardware of M777ER howitzer.

Project HB6 is a new start effort for FY2020 which supports the mobile howitzer program.  The Mobile 155mm Howitzer is a Self-Propelled, 155mm Wheeled Howitzer that provides lethal, proactive counter-fire essential for the survivability of the maneuver formations and other close support fires as required.  The Mobile Howitzer improves the Field Artillery Battalion's ability to maintain pace with its supporting maneuver formations and survive against responsive, counter-fire from near-peer threats with rapid displacement and emplacement times.  The mobile howitzer will improve tactical mobility and system survivability compared to existing towed howitzer systems.  Development efforts, prototyping and evaluations will focus on attributes such as improved emplacement and displacement times, driving speed, and crew protection capabilities, all without sacrificing lethality versus existing towed howitzer systems.  Program activities in FY2020 will be focused on assessing current prototype mobile howitzers to increase maneuverability when engaging targets during emergency fire missions and increase Soldier survivability during counter-fire movements.  Systems will be assessed in an operational environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, is a Joint Service program between the US Marine Corps (USMC) and US Army which provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. The LW155 was first introduced into the USMC in April 2005 and the Marines have fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) commenced in FY2014 and will continue through FY2018. The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan, receiving high marks for its performance.  It replaces all howitzers in all USMC missions and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 40km with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms.  It is a successful joint service program between the USMC and US Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer.  The howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system, since it has been in the field for more than ten years.   

Production and fielding of the LW155 concluded and entered into the Sustainment Life Cycle Phase.  Current development efforts are focused on extending the range of the LW155 to reduce the threat of being out ranged by potential adversaries and meeting the range key performance parameter objective distance (greater than 40km) as stated in the Joint US Army, USMC Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for Advanced Towed Cannon System, but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Production and fielding of the M777A2 has concluded and has now entered into the Sustainment Life Cycle Phase.  Current RDTE efforts are focused on extending the range of the M777A2 to reduce the threat of being out ranged by potential adversaries and meeting the range key performance parameter objective distance (>40KM) as stated in the Joint US Army, USMC Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for Advanced Towed Cannon System, but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule.  The USMC and US Army are leveraging technology being developed as part of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program by the US Army.  The ERCA program is a suite of technologies, cannon, ammunition and fire control, to increase the range of cannon artillery to exceed peer competitors range (>70KM).  An operational assessment of the M777 Extended Range howitzer will be conducted at the end of FY20 to support the decision point for procurement in support of an Urgent Materiel Release.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project HB6 is a new start effort for FY2020 which supports the mobile howitzer program.  The Mobile 155mm Howitzer is a Self-Propelled, 155mm Wheeled Howitzer that provides lethal, proactive counter-fire essential for the survivability of the maneuver formations and other close support fires as required.  The Mobile Howitzer improves the Field Artillery Battalion's ability to maintain pace with its supporting maneuver formations and survive against responsive, counter-fire from near-peer threats with rapid displacement and emplacement times.  The mobile howitzer will improve tactical mobility and system survivability compared to existing towed howitzer systems.  Development efforts, prototyping and evaluations will focus on attributes such as improved emplacement and displacement times, driving speed, and crew protection capabilities, all without sacrificing lethality versus existing towed howitzer systems.  Program activities in FY2020 will be focused on assessing current prototype mobile howitzers to increase maneuverability when engaging targets during emergency fire missions and increase Soldier survivability during counter-fire movements.  Systems will be assessed in an operational environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This LOE provides solutions for current issues with stove-piped mission command systems that function well individually, but do not integrate easily with each other nor does it provide an accurate common operating picture.  FY 2019 Base funding in the amount $3.367 million in support of Army Human Resource Systems (AHRS) continues to provide the Warfighter with state of art standardized systems that assist the Combatant Commander sustain, train, equip, deploy and account for personnel in and out of Theater. Systems include GoArmyEd, Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard, Deployed Theater Accountability System, Range Facility Maintenance Support System, and the electronic Military Personnel System.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Line of Effort 2: Common Operating Environment
This project funds the Personnel Transformation - Enterprise Service Bus and GoArmyEd. Personnel Transformation (PT) - Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) - The Army's Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) provides a data integration service in which data can be extracted from the legacy human resource systems and transferred to DIMHRS.  The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between the Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) , the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. 

 GoArmyEd is an Army Continuing Education System (ACES) program that provides the virtual gateway for soldiers to request Tuition Assistance (TA) and Department of the Army (DA) civilians to request training funds online, anytime for classroom, distance learning, and online college courses. GoArmyEd is a dynamic online portal that automates many of the paper-based processes historically conducted in-person at Army Education Centers. GoArmyEd includes automated registration tools that enforce TA policies and procedures.  It is used by authorized customers to pursue their post secondary educational goals; Army Education Counselors to provide educational guidance; CPMS and TMs to manage civilian training and Colleges to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress.

Modernization initiatives address continued improvements related to the integration of new users and decreasing reliance on the help desk. GoArmyEd is the Army's enterprise education solution. GoArmyEd has integrated the Reserve Component (USAR and National Guard) and the Department of the Army Civilians. In addition, GoArmyEd is working to add a new data warehouse for HQ data retrieval and user self help tools. Education benefits are paramount to recruiting and retention of quality Soldiers, Civilians and Families.

Commanders Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD) began with the identification of capability gaps arising out of the 2010 Red Book and 2012 Gold Book, two extensive studies directed by senior army leadership to examine suicide prevention (Red Book) and the Army's health and discipline (Gold Book). The studies illustrated that Commanders faced capability gaps in their ability to identify high risk behavior and risk factors, analyze soldier and unit risk, and identify risk trends and develop intervention strategies. CRRD provides Commanders at echelons Company through Major Army Command the ability to visualize and take preventive action to mitigate risk factors impacting their soldiers and formations by going to one dashboard and seeing data from multiple data sources.

The United States Army Reserve (USAR) utilizes the Regional Level Application Software (RLAS) as an enterprise system for duty attendance, military pay, Soldier records management and training calendar management to access, transact, store and manage Soldier and unit data required to conduct synchronized USAR operations. Unlike the Army Active Component (AC) where Soldier military pay is centrally managed and input at the installation level, the USAR utilizes RLAS to manage and input decentralized Soldier pay transactions at the unit level. RLAS consists of four modules: Pay, Personnel, Training, and Resource Management. Research and Development (R&amp;D) authority and funding will provide RLAS with investment funds for necessary system development and system modifications. R&amp;D funding amounts increase slightly towards the end of RLAS lifecycle (FY 2019 and 2020) in order to fully support the Integrated Pay and Personnel System - Army (IPPS-A) transition.  Annually, USAR will provide sustainment funding.  R&amp;D authority and sustainment funding will meet the  USAR Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and Office of the Secretary of Defense Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) opinions regarding defense information Technology (IT) system for R&amp;D activities. Necessary RLAS system development and system modifications include: 1) IPPS-A interface requirements; 2) implementing Microsoft .net Framework 4.5 standards; 3) implementing new Operating Systems (OS), system utilities and other technology products. Enhanced development and modification to RLAS will improve RLAS system capabilities and bring RLAS into compliance with various Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and audit readiness requirements. RLAS will continue to process duty attendance, military pay, Soldier personnel transactions and training calendars until the system is fully subsumed by IPPS-A.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Installation Support Modules (ISM) consists of four standardized, web based, custom-developed enterprise wide applications that integrate essential installation business practices and processes throughout the Army, to meet Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) Brigade Combat Team readiness and deployment requirements. Three modules support human resources business functions (In/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over $9 billion combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory. The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. 
  
Coalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  

Army Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicide attempts are collected and stored in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.

ISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Funding supports research and development to comply with Department of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.0 million.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) System interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The MC4 System fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed Service members' medical treatment to include its associated medical surveillance.  The MC4 System supports other Soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army Chief Information Office (CIO) Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.

FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $0.056 million will be used for the engineering effort required to evaluate initiatives that improve the performance of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS) Electronic Health Record software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capabilities.  Activities include:
--Monitor research and development activities with Research partners (United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, and United States Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center) to identify emerging technologies for potential insertion into the electronic health record system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MC4 Program supports a number of Army Medical Information Technology/Communications initiatives. The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Defense Healthcare Management Systems Electronic Health Record integrated software application suite, future modernized capability, and other Army requirements.  The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components. Since Electronic Health Record software is a major component of the MC4 System and being developed in increments by the Joint Program, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades.  The MC4 Program works with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities, and forward into the future with a fully modernized system.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, cloud computing capability environment, etc.) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Increment 1 of the new Army Acquisition Domain Data Management (AADDM) capability will focus on programmatic information such as Integrated Master Schedules (IMS), cost and budget, industrial base and contractor information.  Increment II will then begin the connection of live, authoritative Army databases to the Acquisition data warehouse.  Once the business processes and external data sources are providing the data: visualization tools can be utilized to provide key charts/views that support Army Staff (ARSTAFF) processes such as Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Weapon System Review (WSR), Strategic Portfolio Analysis and Review (SPAR), and budget execution drills. Supporting efforts include business process evaluation and definition to maximize efficiency of the Software integration process. Completion of Increment I PM Tools software integration, demonstration and evaluation of the PM Tools in a 6-9 month pilot event within a minimum of one PEO.  Funding also supports further acquisition integration of external data sources as required.  Further focus will concentrate on delivering more common data views and analytical capabilities to support decision making at Product Manager (PdM), Program Manager (PM), Program Executive Officer (PEO), ASA (ALT), and at ARSTAFF levels. Key events include the PM Tool pilot evaluation and a FP Tool deployment decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Accessions Information Environment (AIE): supports the Army's Accessions Enterprise (AIE). The AIE aligns authorities, responsibilities, and resources, for Total Army accessions. It provides the Army's strength through its four missions: (1) enlist Soldiers, (2) commission Officers, (3) fulfill In-Service requirements, and (4) support and sustain. The AIE will replace a majority of the current legacy Accessions IT systems. Successful implementation is of upmost priority for the enterprise. The Accessions Information Environment (AIE) is a COTS-based information technology (IT) software system planned to modernize the Army's Accessions Enterprise. It will be a fully integrated Army-wide enterprise level software system for the accessions workforce to acquire the best-qualified warfighting talent (officer/enlisted/internal recruiting requirements/civilians) to meet all Army manning requirements. The key functions for AIE will include the following core capabilities: lead generation &amp; management, prospecting, interviewing, processing, intelligence, marketing, training &amp; leader development, and pay &amp; incentives. This effort will ultimately ensure the accessions workforce has the information needed to engender commitments, lead future Soldiers, and engage communities in direct contact with young Americans.

HRC Accessioning IT:  In addition, this program supports the development requirements for the Army Human Resources Command (USAHRC) which provides the IT solution necessary to accomplish the Army's Accessioning mission. Supports the ongoing development efforts which provides for the IT solutions necessary to accomplish the Army's Accessioning mission.

Army Suicide Prevention: This Program Element (PE) develops a pre-entry or entry assessment package that enhances the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development). This PE enhances the Army's ability to identify individuals with a higher likelihood of having already experienced, or of potentially experiencing, sub- clinical behavioral issues, as well as to identify character strengths (e.g., resilience, grit), to ensure that the Army can meet mission requirements in the current and future operating environments. Research in this PE will result in more precise determinations of individual potential for future successful service, and more targeted identification of need for individual assistance (e.g., intervention, training, behavioral health) to increase likelihood of future success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Accessions Information Environment (AIE): 
AIE is following the streamlined Acquisition process for Defense Business Systems (DBS) in accordance with DoD 5000.75 and is targeted to be designated as a Business System Category (BSC) II program.  

AIE is pursuing a rapid prototyping approach to acquire innovative COTS technologies to support the Army's Accessions needed capabilities. A competitive prototype contract will be awarded to execute the prototype phase. The prototyping efforts will result in capability to be delivered in waves:
Infrastructure &amp; Application Pilot (Wave 1): Includes foundational operational capabilities such as commercial cloud &amp; network capabilities, initial data migration from legacy systems, critical interfaces, defined data models, and initial lead generation &amp; management process build out.
Wave 1 Application Pilot: Includes key software capabilities to support the Army's Accessions mission. These processes will enable the transition from "civilian to
soldier".
Waves 2-5: Additional automated capability to support optimization of accessions business processes.

At the completion of the Waves, AIE will deliver the lead generation &amp; management, prospecting, interviewing, processing, intelligence, marketing, training &amp; leader development, and pay &amp; incentives capabilities to support the Army's Accessions mission. Capabilities will be delivered using an agile methodology.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

SOLDIER FOR LIFE-TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM XXI (SFL-TAP XXI): The Transition Assistance Program XXI (TAP-XXI) application provides an interactive, multimedia approach to pre-separation counseling and job assistance training. This application uses full motion video, graphics, and sound to train clients; and schedules clients for classroom-type instruction. It integrates a complete range of transition services and benefits for service members, Department of Defense civilian employees, and their family members as they transition from the military. TAP-XXI is a web-based, three-tiered application with a centralized database for all Transition sites. The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers.  The requirements in place today represent a 300 percent increase over the pre-VOW requirements.  A significant modernization effort within TAP XXI is needed.  Justification: ($ in Millions) FY2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.606 million resources the TAP XXI modernization requirements.  Planned Program includes modernize client management module, Soldier module, and increase reporting capabilities.  

Human Resource Command (HRC) Core IT: This program supports efforts to plan, design, develop, and test Information Technology (IT) solutions to fulfill the Army's Warfighter Support Mission, accommodate emerging Army requirements, and fulfill Future Army needs.  Ongoing development efforts support multiple functional areas including logistics, personnel, transportation, training, medical/health protection, and the sustaining base.  The focus of the rationalization effort is to identify value-added applications capable of serving a broader Army enterprise audience and garnering efficiencies through the elimination of outdated, legacy, and duplicative applications.  Applications are upgraded or enhanced to meet compliance with Army Common Operating Environment standards in accordance with Army Application Management Business Office (AAMBO). Additionally, program supports enhancements and modifications to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS) and iPERMS-Secure (iPERMS-S), as well as development of interfaces based upon emerging requirements, Cybersecurity, functionality and compliance with Army standards.

R-Builder is a living application database system that allows the Manning Program Evaluation Group (MM PEG) to update the database to include various cost drivers and factors used for programming, budgeting for all Army Service members pay, allowances, and benefits for the all-volunteer Army. R-Builder is used to develop the annual Program Objective Memorandum -Budget Estimate Submission (POM-BES), and to develop and manage the Army's military and civilian personnel in order to execute the President's National Security Strategy.

The Army Review Board Agency (ARBA) operates under the delegated authority of the Secretary of the Army as the final level of appeal for service members in uniform, veterans, and their family members, adjudicating tens of thousands of claimed errors or injustices annually. ARBA is staffed with 128 military personnel, civilians, and contractors, and additional 350 external Advisors and Boards Members. ARBA struggles with the substantial process and system-related inefficiencies. The Agency currently uses the ARBA Case Tracking System (ACTS) to facilitate case adjudication and the routing of corresponding hard copy case files (a.k.a. "redwelds"). This system was custom built in 1999, strictly for tracking the hand offs of redwelds. At its inception, ACTS was a huge leap forward; however, as the organization and technology evolved, the system has not been able to meet new Agency mission objectives and streamlining initiatives. This antiquated system costs the Agency multi-millions in annual sustainment fees and lacks the agility to address changing business requirements and organizational roles.

Army SHARP Data Management System (DMS) Integrated Case Reporting System (ICRS) enhancements will provide stabilization for sexual harassment (SH) data collection, reporting requirements, and analytic processes; ICRS maintains Army sexual assault (SA) legacy data collected prior to 2014 in the Sexual Assault Data Management System (SADMS) IAW public law.

ARIMS is the Army's policy and enterprise system deployed to meet statutory (36 CFR) and regulatory (AR 25-1, AR 25-400-2) requirements to manage records that document the policies, decisions, and actions of the Army both as a military department and federal institution. ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY18) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army's classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army's records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations.  Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.

Family Advocacy System of Records (FASOR) is the information system used by the Army to manage child and adult based abuse incidents referred by the Family Advocacy Program (FAP).  FASOR  is used to capture/perform  incident case management and allows for standardization of reviews and incident determinations. FASOR  is a key system used in FAP Army Central Registry (ACR) background checks when determining suitability of individuals to be placed into "positions of trust".  Finally, FASOR facilitates reporting and data analysis in support of internal, Army, DoD, FOIA and Congressional requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This funds contractor man-years for technical and analytical expertise in the integration and validation of operational databases used to store and research combat records from combat operations in Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Panama, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other contingency operations. The effort supports over 30 distinct and unique operational databases that directly support research into Veteran claims for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Agent Orange, and other medical conditions developed by Soldiers during combat and non-combat operations. Supports the Army?s Data Center Consolidation by turning data base structure to be more efficient and reduce maintenance support costs.

Increased Congressional inquiries and litigation have raised leadership awareness of the need to improve records management compliance Army-wide. SecArmy directed workgroup, led by the AASA, with participation by the CIO/G-6, NETCOM, OGC, and OCLL is to provide a comprehensive solution for the Army and integrate and standardize management systems for the Army?s business operations. Enhancing and modernizing of existing ARIMS functionality and capability to support the SecArmy initiative includes updating ARIMS to support current technology such as Microsoft SharePoint environment, expanding storage capability, including network storage , and commensurate expansion of backup, security and communications capabilities over CONUS and OCONUS networks.  This effort supports the ADCCP program.

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2020 funding is to modernize and re-engineer the current ARBA Case Tracking System (ACTS) that is in sustainment. ARBA?s leadership has aggressively driven business process reengineering to include end-to-end case digitization. However, ACTS? inflexibility stands in the way of Agency progress on many fronts and negatively affects the timeliness, costs, and quality of ARBA?s work products. Additionally, ARBA has undergone increasing congressional scrutiny, unfavorable media conclusions, and publicized court remands surrounding the quality and timeliness of its 18,000 annual adjudication outcomes. As a result, ARBA leadership has committed to Congress that it will drive fundamental change across the DOTMLPF-P spectrum.

In summary, these significant problems result in greatly extended processing times, bottle-necked and rushed adjudication activities, numerous redundant hand-offs, and at times incorrect or contestable board outcomes. ARBA?s current process requires labor-intensive hard copy printing, collating, transporting, filing, scanning, labeling, inventorying, shipping, shredding, mailing, and tracking of redwelds and their content.
- ARBA ADS Modernization capability requirements can be summarized as follows: 
- Lifecycle Case Management ? End-to-end Structured Process
- Complete Case Digitization (electronic cases, board scheduling/voting, approvals, signatures)
- Improved External Stakeholder Exchange and Case Transit
- Leverage Historical Information/Comprehensive Knowledge Management Capability
- Performance Assessment Framework ? Real-Time, Reliable Metrics
- Modern, Flexible and Reliable IT Platform Supporting Mobility and Information Exchange</r2:Text>

FASOR  is used to capture/perform  incident case management and allows for standardization of reviews and incident determinations. FASOR  is a key system used in FAP Army Central Registry (ACR) background checks when determining suitability of individuals to be placed into "positions of trust".  Finally, FASOR facilitates reporting and data analysis in support of internal, Army, DoD, FOIA and Congressional requirements.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds information technology systems that support Army Training.

The Army Training Information System (ATIS) is designated a Defense Business System (DBS) that will develop, integrate, test, deliver, operate, and maintain an enterprise capability for the army training and education communities. Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of training information systems that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting visualization, understanding, and informed decision making.

ATIS Capabilities include:
-  Training Development.  Provides centralized access to training information anytime, anywhere, including educational and professional instruction.
-  Training Management.  Provides centralized ability to access and manage information, including individual and collective/unit training that supports mission tasks and individual training records.
-  Enterprise Scheduling.  Provides a single integrated set of applications to schedule training resources, including transportation, classrooms, ranges, supplies, and mandated legal/social individual and unit training.
-  Content Management.  Provides centralized access to training information anytime, anywhere, including educational and professional instruction.
-  Resource Management.  Provides ability to manage availability/sustainability of training enablers and resources. 

Enhancement of Army Training Models (ATM) will provide the resources to build and sustain readiness requirements in a standardized process for automated methodology development and resource allocation in support of the Army's training needs.

The Army Career Tracker is leader development tool that leverages Army's prior investments to integrate education, training, assignment, self-development and other systems by linking these valuable technologies and resources into a common user-friendly portal across 1.35 million users consisting of enlisted, officers, and civilians. 
Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership. ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now.  ACT allows users to manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals. ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning. The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and Army's success. Users manage their lifelong learning career objectives, monitor progress towards career development and goals, search multiple Army education and training resources, and receive personalized advice from their supervisor and Army leadership. 
Completed development will modernize the Army Career Tracker (ACT) system to render web pages correctly base on the size of the screen.  Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that renders web pages based on the size of the device's display screen (e.g., computer, tablet, and phone). This allows the site to load quickly and ensures the display appears as if it were made expressly for the device being used. RWD improves user experience by displaying messages, links, and controls in a logical manner regardless of the device.  The actual presentation may not look the same across different devices; rather the rendering will depend on the Operating System (OS), screen size, screen resolution, and other factors. Implementing RWD on ACT would be a step forward toward allowing ACT to render better on tablets and other mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones).  

Universal Course Authoring Tool / The UCAT (Universal Curriculum and Assessment Tool) will serve as the primary curriculum and assessment development tool for curriculum development projects in meeting the directives from higher headquarters to transition into a new, digital learning environment. UCAT will support the delivery of curriculum and assessment products on a variety of different platforms in support of both resident and non-resident programs.

MIT LL Networked Pronunciation Feedback Program (NETProf) expansion will allow for further expansion and further utilization of the existing NetProF products for DLIFLC faculty and students. To reach higher levels of proficiency in foreign languages the planned dialog system would give an advantage to DLIFLC teachers to help students gain advances through practicing speaking using this new dialog system, and the connected NetProF improvement system for pronunciation for longer utterances. This feasibility study will help set new parameters for developing very advanced language teaching systems that otherwise could not be supported.  This is in support of the 2+/2+/2 plan.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Training Information System (ATIS) is a Category II Defense Business System and will follow the Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) in accordance with DoD 5000.75. ATIS will comprise of Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) and/or Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) that will provide a Common Operational Picture (COP) of the training environment. This will enable Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess Army training requirements. ATIS efforts will ultimately reduce the lifecycle costs of training by retiring more than 29 duplicative, stove-piped systems and improve performance with a net centric, standards-based, architecturally compliant system.  The overarching strategy is centered on three distinct acquisition phases. 

Phase I - Program risk mitigation effort. Characterized by competitive selection of three vendors to develop, demonstrate and deliver to the Government three ATIS prototype systems with specified documentation.
Phase II - Each system will be evaluated at the end of the prototyping phase and one vendor will be selected for engineering, development and deployment.
Phase III - Upon full deployment of the system, a Sustainment Contract will be awarded for support and potential disposal of the system at the end of its useful life. ATIS intends to use Interim Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS) for initial sustainment beginning at Limited Deployment and will then transition to a hybrid life-cycle sustainment using a combination of CLS and government entities at Full Deployment (FD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Criminal Investigative Command has one effort for which RDT&amp;E may be applied:

Criminal Investigative Management System (CIMS). CIMS, formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG).  Through CIMS, the USACIDC and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data.  CIMS leverages existing and future Army Law Enforcement (LE) enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  The Consolidated Operations Police Suite (COPS) was previously comprised of five separate applications: two of these applications have been rationalized under ALERTS; the remaining three (related to the Army Corrections discipline) require modernization to ensure continued function and security compliance. RDT&amp;E dollars are required to further enhance &amp; enable CIMS' consolidation/rationalization of LE applications thereby providing the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime while also facilitating the management of those placed in corrections facilities.

                                <r2:Title>Criminal Investigative Management System (CIMS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Criminal Investigative Management System (CIMS). CIMS, formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG).  Through CIMS, the USACIDC and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data.  CIMS leverages existing and future Army Law Enforcement (LE) enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  The Consolidated Operations Police Suite (COPS) was previously comprised of five separate applications: two of these applications have been rationalized under ALERTS; the remaining three (related to the Army Corrections discipline) require modernization to ensure continued function and security compliance. RDT&amp;E dollars are required to further enhance &amp; enable CIMS? consolidation/rationalization of LE applications thereby providing the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime while also facilitating the management of those placed in corrections facilities.  At present, all requested CID RDT&amp;E funding in program element 0605013A will be applied to CIMS initiatives.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The US Military Entrance Processing Command Integrated Resource System (MIRS) provides automation and communications capabilities to support the peacetime, mobilization and wartime military manpower accession mission for the Armed Services. USMEPCOM conducts its work through 65 Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) across the country and 189 Military Entrance Test Sites (METS). MIRS provides automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, enlisting and shipping applicants for the Armed Forces, Reserves, and Coast Guard. This includes support for automated versions of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) tests. MIRS initiates Social Security Administration (SSA) checks for identity verification; interfaces with US Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) to verify citizenship status for military service applicants to screen out individuals that may be security threats; and interfaces with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for background screening, using digital fingerprints to identify/eliminate individuals with criminal records from entering military service. 

MIRS supports recruiting capabilities through electronic interfaces and data sharing, using standard Department of Defense (DoD) data elements with Recruiting Service systems. In the event a military draft is required, MIRS supports mobilization through electronic links with the Selective Service System (SSS) as well as automated support for conducting aptitude tests and medical examinations and administratively processing, inducting and shipping SSS registrants. 

Customers/beneficiaries of this investment: the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI), including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM, and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Personnel &amp; Readiness (P&amp;R)

Stakeholders include: All Uniformed Services, Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Transportation Management Office (DTMO), OSD P&amp;R, Undersecretary of Defense (USD) Intel, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), and Department of Veteran's Affairs.
Requested funding underpins system sustainability and scalability and improves cybersecurity to include protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Funding covers costs to redesign/develop existing MIRS capabilities to operate efficiently in a cloud environment and to integrate with MHS-Genesis. This will allow for the closure of 65 Army data centers, in support of the Army Data Center Consolidation Plan (Army Directive 2016-38) and movement towards the Force of the Future mandate of all digital processing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Force Information Management (GFIM):  GFIM will provide the Army an enterprise, integrated authoritative force management capability for lifecycle management of force/organizational structure data for the entire Army.  In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  

The Army Training Information System (ATIS) will provide a common operational picture (COP) of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities. Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of training information systems that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting visualization, understanding, and informed decision making.  

The Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to preserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.

The Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&amp;E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).

This program supports HRC efforts to plan, design, develop, and test Information Technology (IT) solutions to fulfill the Army's Warfighter Support Mission, accommodate emerging Army requirements, and fulfill Future Army needs.  Ongoing development efforts support multiple functional areas including logistics, personnel, transportation, training, medical/health protection, and the sustaining base.

The HRC focus of the rationalization effort is to identify value-added applications capable of serving a broader Army enterprise audience and garnering efficiencies through the elimination of outdated, legacy, and duplicative applications.  Applications are upgraded or enhanced to meet compliance with Army Common Operating Environment standards in accordance with Army Application Management Business Office (AAMBO). Additionally, program supports enhancements and modifications to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS) and iPERMS-Secure (iPERMS-S), as well as development of interfaces based upon emerging requirements, Cybersecurity, functionality and compliance with Army standards. 

SOLDIER FOR LIFE-TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM XXI (SFL-TAP XXI): The Transition Assistance Program XXI (TAP-XXI) application provides an interactive, multimedia approach to pre-separation counseling and job assistance training. This application uses full motion video, graphics, and sound to train clients; and schedules clients for classroom-type instruction. It integrates a complete range of transition services and benefits for service members, Department of Defense civilian employees, and their family members as they transition from the military. TAP-XXI is a web-based, three-tiered application with a centralized database for all Transition sites. The user interface is browser-based, the application is based on a storefront intranet model to provide access from within Transition centers.  The requirements in place today represent a 300 percent increase over the pre-VOW requirements.  A significant modernization effort within TAP XXI is needed.  Justification: FY2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $606,000 resources the TAP XXI modernization requirements.

The Defense Language Software Upgrade will perform a major modification to the Universal Course Authoring Tool (UCAT).  The modification will enable the tool to allow the curriculum development department to author new curricula without having to know a programming language, such as HTML. Currently, the tool has limited authoring templets and doesn't support the higher language levels or contain testing templets.  The tool will do the programming automatically in the proper format for online viewing regardless of the mobile device used to view the material.  This will enable the author to input the content in a predetermined way and the program will convert it into the proper online format. There will also be programming support to develop and convert existing online material into the current formats for use with all mobile devices regardless of the operating system used. Our current online material does not support all mobile devices and it needs to be reprogrammed to support all current mobile devices regardless of the Operating System (OS) used (Android, Apple, Microsoft).  The Defense Language Institute (DLI) doesn't have the capability to do any programming modifications to existing programs. The programs are in need of modifications to meet DLI's new graduation standards of 2+/2+.
      
The Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY 2014, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS).

Army Career Tracker (ACT) is a leader development tool created to change significantly the way training, education, and experiential learning support is provided to Army enlisted, officers, civilians, and their leaders/supervisors.  Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership.  ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now.  ACT allows users to manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals.  ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning.  The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and the Army's success.  ACT comprises over 780,000 users with an adoption rate of 4,000 users per week.  HQDA EXORD 054-12 ISO Army Transition mandates that leaders utilize roles in ACT to promote life-long learning and development opportunities throughout the Soldier's lifecycle of service (hire to retire).

Criminal Information Management System (CIMS): CIMS, formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG).  Through CIMS, the USACIDC and the OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that houses both classified and unclassified Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data.  CIMS leverages existing and future Army Law Enforcement (LE) enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) providing Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence functions as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  The Consolidated Operations Police Suite (COPS) was previously comprised of five separate applications: two of these applications have been rationalized under ALERTS; the remaining three (related to the Army Corrections discipline) require modernization to ensure continued function and security compliance. RDT&amp;E dollars are required to further enhance &amp; enable CIMS' consolidation/rationalization of LE applications thereby providing the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime while also facilitating the management of those placed in corrections facilities.  At present, all requested CID RDT&amp;E funding will be applied to CIMS initiatives.

Educational Outreach Initiative:  The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC), a subordinate element of USACIDC, requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. The DFSC was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011). This memorandum states that the DFSC will establish a forensic RDT&amp;E program that provides the integration of joint operational research, including procedures for establishing customer requirements, and identifying gaps and needs that lead to RDT&amp;E priorities. The program includes developing a scholarly environment across the Defense Forensic Enterprise through the use of educational partnerships, internships and fellowships to facilitate participation in RDT&amp;E projects.  The Educational Outreach program provides an opportunity for students to contribute to forensic science research and influence shared research priorities across forensic science communities, while simultaneously supporting DFSC laboratory operations. Through the internship program, innovative research is conducted that supports research capabilities across the entire range of defense forensic operations (traditional laboratory, expeditionary (forward-deployed) laboratories, and reach-back functions).  

Research &amp; Development Identified through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Initiative:  The DFSC requires funds to coordinate the execution of forensic research projects that will enhance the capability of forensic science applications for DoD customers both in traditional law enforcement/criminal justice settings as well as in expeditionary environments.  The DFSC staff manage federally-funded research &amp; development contracts identified through a two-year, rolling BAA procedure.  The BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Submitted BAA research proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984" (and subsequent applicable amendments).

                                <r2:Title>ARIMS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>ARIMS is the Army?s policy and enterprise system deployed to meet statutory (36 CFR) and regulatory (AR 25-1, AR 25-400-2) requirements to manage records that document the policies, decisions, and actions of the Army both as a military department and federal institution. ARIMS provides approximately 64,000 (FY 2018) users with tools and capabilities to collect and preserve Army records, serves as the records management component of Army Knowledge On-Line, and the Secretary of the Army has mandated its use to collect and preserve Army records. ARIMS is replicated on the SIPRNet with ARIMS-Classified (ARIMS-C) to provide similar capabilities for the collection and preservation of the Army?s classified records. ARIMS is an integrated system that supports the SecArmy objective to integrate management systems for the Army?s records management programs and business operations. This line item funds for system, network, and application management for the ARIMS and ARIMS-C infrastructure. Technology changes, integration, and systems migration require contractor support to ensure Army Electronic Archives continues to preserve essential electronic records. These activities support the ARIMS applications and comply with the SecArmy and senior Army leadership to integrate and standardize management systems for business operations. Failure to fund will result in the loss of expertise and in extensive down time in the event of any hardware or software failure in the ARIMS infrastructure. ARIMS downtime precludes the collection and preservation of the Army long-term important records (such as CONOPS records). As a web-based GOTS system, ARIMS is dependent on private industry expertise to conduct troubleshooting and correction of any application or operating system component that is the foundation of the ARIMS and ARIMS-C systems. These skill sets are not maintained by government staff and must, by DoD directive (C3I), be acquired from the private sector.

This funds contractor man-years for technical and analytical expertise in the integration and validation of operational databases used to store and research combat records from combat operations in Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Panama, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other contingency operations. The effort supports over 30 distinct and unique operational databases that directly support research into Veteran claims for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Agent Orange, and other medical conditions developed by Soldiers during combat and non-combat operations. Supports the Army?s Data Center Consolidation by turning data base structure to be more efficient and reduce maintenance support costs.

This line item funds contractor man-year for Middleware Software Engineering for the programming and integration of linkages between ARIMS, Army Information Systems and NARA?s Gateway, that generate or store long-term important records as part of functional business processes. Failure to fund at the requested level will preclude the efficient, effective, and transparent capture and preservation of important Army records generated by Army Information Systems. Without this capability, Army Information System managers will be required to manually extract and index records for submission and preservation in the ARIMS system. This effort supports the ADCCP program to ensure efficient use of Army resources and fulfill RMDA?s mission.

Increased Congressional inquiries and litigation have raised leadership awareness of the need to improve records management compliance Army-wide. SecArmy directed workgroup, led by the AASA, with participation by the CIO/G-6, NETCOM, OGC, and OCLL is to provide a comprehensive solution for the Army and integrate and standardize management systems for the Army?s business operations. Enhancing and modernizing of existing ARIMS functionality and capability to support the SecArmy initiative includes updating ARIMS to support current technology such as Microsoft SharePoint environment, expanding storage capability, including network storage, and commensurate expansion of backup, security and communications capabilities over CONUS and OCONUS networks. This effort supports the ADCCP program.

                                <r2:Title>Army Business System Modernization Initiatives</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Modernization requirements will add new capabilities to legacy IT systems that support human resource functions such as organization and position management, training, and employment.  The PPB BOS system standardize and integrate the transactional information systems used in the Headquarters Department of Army (HQDA)  Programming and Budgeting processes.   The program is streamlining programming and budgeting business processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The PPB BOS architecture reengineers, streamlines, and consolidates HQDA systems and financial feeder systems; aligns to the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA); implements powerful business intelligence analytical tools to support strategic planning, programming, and budgeting within HQDA; and provides access to GFEBS funds management and execution data through system interfaces with required SFIS compliancy integral to the PPB BOS data model.  The LEAP program will provide criminal intelligence querying and reporting capabilities in compliance with regulatory and policy standards for Army Law Enforcement regarding investigation of felony crimes.  LEAP captures criminal case investigative information regarding incidents, location descriptors, entities (name, social security number, rank, title, physical characteristics, sex, birth place, and date), agent assignment, crime description and identifiers, statements, property data, laboratory tests; verifies and stores this data for criminal intelligence purposes: and reports this information to the proper authorities from the Division Commanding Officer to the United States Grand Jury.  The system will extract necessary data for consolidation and input to Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) monthly reports, National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) monthly reports and the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII) daily updates.  The LIMS system will automate business processes that support the forensic examiners. These processes include, but are not limited to, analytics, materials management, management reporting, Freedom of Information Act requests (FOIA), legal discovery request, court preparation and outsource processing.

Civilian Personnel Online - Portal (CPOL-Portal) is a one stop secure site which provides Army civilian employees and HR specialists access to a private portal with a complete set of employment related resources, links and web based applications that require single sign-on access - Army Regional Tools (ART). CPOL-Portal will provide an Integrated Management System (IMS) in support of Civilian Workforce Transformation (CWT). It will support Civilian human capital decision making and allow leaders and
employees to perform their roles more efficiently in support of Army goals and missions. CPOL Portal will provide the full spectrum of IT application support and access to Acquire, Develop, Distribute and Sustain components of the Army Civilian HCM Life-Cycle and link to G3 'Structure' IT Enterprise Applications.

The Fully Automated System for Classification (FASCLASS) is a centralized, web-based system that maintains civilian position descriptions and position related information across Department of the Army.  It provides classifiers and managers capability to create, edit, and verify position descriptions.  Also it offers robust search, report generation, and lookup &amp; support capabilities.

The Overseas Entitlement Tracker (OET) provides the capability to accurately track Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). LQA is provided to reimburse employees for suitable, adequate living quarters at posts where the U.S. Government does not provide quarters. OET also tracks these other overseas entitlements for employees: Advance Pay, Danger Pay, Imminent Danger Pay, Foreign Differential, Home Leave, Post Allowance, Separation Maintenance Allowance, and Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Modernize IT legacy systems across Army IT domains by adapting/improving government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and new software development to perform various tasks in a networked environment. These efforts include Army Contract Writing System (ACWS), Army Training Information System (ATIS), Soldier Management System (SMS), Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD), the Army Strategic Readiness Update (ASRU), Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP),Educational Outreach Program, R&amp;D Broad Agency Program, Program Planning Budget Execution (PPBE) - Business Operating System (BOS), Automated Orders and Resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base -Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), KEYSTONE Retain System, Army Contract Writing System (ACWS), Army Mapper, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).

ACWS strategy is to perform all requisite activities to concurrently develop pre-milestone A/B documentation and perform pre-solicitation/source selection activities to meet the USD AT&amp;L timelines for building a contract writing system to replace legacy contract systems to include the Standard Procurement System (SPS).

ASMIS-R is comprised of legacy modules (applications) that require modernization to maintain their relevancy to the Army in support of mishap reduction. As stated above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.

Additionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state, does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above. The Command has utilized a FFP contract to execute specific Task Orders to develop the tools and products through mid-year FY 2015. The CRC will be competing a new contract vehicle to support the development of products and tools from midyear FY 2015 through FY 2019.

HQDA AG-1 Civilian Personnel (CP) Systems' Acquisition Strategy - The HQDA AG-1 Civilian Personnel (CP) office, Civilian Information Services Division (CISD) Chief and Program Managers will manage these modernization efforts and will utilize the HQDA AG-1 CP's Configuration Control Committee (CCC), Configuration Control Board (CCB), and Integrated Product Teams (IPT) to ensure the appropriate functionality is implemented into OET, CPOL Portal, and FASCLASS.  Development tasks will be performed by AG-1 CP's contractor staff, whose performance is monitored according to the Quality Assurance Surveillance Program. In addition, unit testing and operational testing will be implemented to ensure the new functionality performs as required.  This work will be performed on a firm- fixed- price contract vehicle.

GFIM will leverage existing Force Management System Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract to execute development efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Remarks>Global Force Information Management (GFIM):  GFIM will provide the Army an enterprise, integrated authoritative force management capability for lifecycle management of force/organizational structure data for the entire Army.  In addition, it will establish a common data standard for force structure data by implementing the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI).  

Army Training Information System (ATIS) is an enterprise system that will provide a common operational picture of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities.  These capabilities will enable commanders, leaders, soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess training requirements so they can more effectively plan, prepare, execute, and assess training. End result is an ATIS that enables soldiers to train as they fight so they can effectively fight as they have trained. 

Adapt/improve/install/field government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and new software to perform various tasks in a networked environment such as data warehousing, force management, personnel, installation and environmental databases and applications to support Business System Transformation and Installation Management, to include Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard.

The Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&amp;E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).

 HRC Core IT: Award date shown reflects iPERMS IT Integration Contract.  SMS-WEB and ASBS 2.0 are on the Digital Application Support Task Order (DASTO) with an award date of  6 Feb 18. 

Criminal Information Management System (CIMS): CIMS formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the Criminal Investigation Command (CIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG). Thru the CIMS, USACIDC and OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program / system that  houses Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data, leveraging existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system, known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS), provides US Army Law Enforcement stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of Law Enforcement and criminal intelligence (CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements. RDT&amp;E dollars are required to further enhance ALERTS and other CIMS systems to continue the consolidation/rationalization of LE applications, and to give the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime.

Educational Outreach Initiative:  The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC), a subordinate element of USACIDC, requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. The DFSC was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011). This memorandum states that the DFSC will establish a forensic RDT&amp;E program that provides the integration of joint operational research, including procedures for establishing customer requirements, and identifying gaps and needs that lead to RDT&amp;E priorities.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to reserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System - Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps.  Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ASMIS-R is comprised of legacy modules (applications) that require modernization to maintain their relevancy to the Army in support of mishap reduction. As stated
above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and
resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.

Additionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state,
does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above. The Command has utilized a FFP contract to execute specific Task Orders
to develop the tools and products through mid-year FY 2015. The CRC will be competing a new contract vehicle to support the development of products and tools from
midyear FY 2015 through FY 2024.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In Section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY16, Public Law 114-92, Congress amended DoD's authority to carry out prototype projects using Other Transaction (OT) agreements. OT agreements are now permanently codified in 10 U.S.C. Section 2371b, titled "Authority of the Department of Defense to Carry out Certain Prototype Projects" and offer a streamlined method for selecting and conducting prototype projects. The ALD Team is taking advantage of this useful acquisition tool to procure ALD prototypes rapidly. Section 2371b requires that competitive procedures be used "to the maximum extent practicable," and the ALD is using a "full and open" Prototype Proposal Opportunity Notice (PPON) to achieve maximum competition.

In addition to the system functional requirements, a directed needs statement directs the program to:
*	Procure no less than two, and not more than four, prototypes for user assessment, development of application protocol interfaces, and development of selected software interfaces with designated Authoritative Data Sources.
*	Phase the program to deliver an initial capability of two to four prototypes no later than 30 days (from award announcement) that allows assessment of the awarded two to four prototypes and a final comparison tradeoff. The results will lead to a follow-on award of one to two prototypes for an additional assessment phase upon execution of a Decision Point.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A) provides an integrated, multi-Component, personnel and pay system, which streamlines the existing Human Resources (HR) systems and processes enhancing efficiency and accuracy of personnel and pay procedures in support of 1.1 million Soldiers and their families.  IPPS-A will subsume approximately 40 legacy systems (full and partial) across the Active, Reserve and National Guard into a single integrated system.  IPPS-A will be a web-based tool, available 24-hours a day, accessible to HR professionals, combatant commanders, pay managers and other authorized users throughout the Army.  IPPS-A addresses major deficiencies in the delivery of military personnel and pay services by providing the necessary internal control and audit procedures as well as preventing erroneous payments and loss of funds. This program is an essential building block to reform the Department towards achieving greater performance and affordability in support of the National Defense Strategy as well as Congressional auditability mandate.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>B66706000 (OPA) Funding will be used for initial system implementation and fielding of IPPS-A to include new equipment training (NET). Training delivery methods include Instructor-led Training, Distance Learning, and Computer Based Training of 66,000 personnel for Increment II.  Training products will be developed using the Oracle Usability Productivity Kit to include instructor manuals and lessons plans, as well as, Electronic Performance Support System and job aids.  The deployment approach will implement pre-deployment activities at each location beginning 360 days in advance of deployment start date.  Deployment will include on-site data conversion, workflow verification, and "over-the-shoulder" support.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>IPPS-A Increment II (Project ED9), formerly designated  as an Acquisition Category IA Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program under the authority of DoDI 5000.02, will transition under the acquisition authority of DoDI 5000.75 as a Business System Category I (BSC 1) program.  The program will be officially designated as a BSC I at the next major Milestone decision, which is Release 2 Limited Deployment Authority to Proceed.  IPPS-A will deliver fully integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components (Active, National Guard, and Reserve) building on the trusted database delivered by the IPPS-A Increment I program.  Increment II revised schedule will consists of three releases (2.0-4.0).  Each release will build upon the previous release, providing pre-defined personnel and/or pay capabilities.  IPPS-A is post Milestone (MS) B (14 December 2014) and have achieved Authorization To Proceed (ATP) for Releases 2 and 3 and working towards ATP for Release 4.  Each release will hold separate Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews prior to the start of development and test activities.  Increment II Full Deployment Decision is anticipated at the conclusion of Release 4.0 when the system will provide integrated personnel and pay capabilities.

Release 2.0-Standard Installation/Division Personnel System (SIDPERS): Began in FY 2015 and delivers capability in FY 2019 building upon Increment I capabilities.  Provides the functionality from PeopleSoft necessary to subsume the SIDPERS system for all ARNG locations.  End-to-end Business Process development considerations will be evaluated to support various activities to include, but not limited to, promotions/demotions, training requirements, member benefits, duty status, and unit level manning. 

Release 3.0-Accountability and Essential Personnel Services: Began in FY 2017 and delivers capability in FY 2020 supporting accountability and essential personnel services necessary to subsume numerous legacy field systems including Electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO) and Total Army Personnel Database-Reserve (TAPDB-R).  IPPS-A will establish a consolidated system that provides accountability and tracking of all personnel to include deployed Soldiers.  It will allow Commanders in the field to access timely, accurate, and standardized personnel data for Soldiers in all components and provide the necessary means to identify Soldiers who should be on a payroll.  In addition to delivering most of the functions required to establish an Army-wide HR system, Release 3.0 will bring HR payroll drivers on board to enhance accuracy of pay, credit for service, and benefits. IPPS-A will serve as the authoritative data source for all personnel within the system. 

Release 4.0-Pay Services: Will begin in FY 2018 and delivers capability in FY 2020 focusing on pay services and building upon Release 2.0 and 3.0 to provide the basis for the fully integrated personnel and pay system.  IPPS-A will incorporate pay functionality to include, but not limited to, base pay, taxes, allowances, bonuses, allotments and leave.  At deployment, Release 4.0 will serve as the authoritative data source for all personnel and pay transactions within IPPS-A and will be able to produce initial data in support of Army audit goals.  As a part of the on-going efforts to revise the Increment II schedule, the former Release 5.0 capabilities have been reorganized under various Pre-Planned Product Improvements post Full Deployment as "dot-release."  These dot-releases will occur post FY 2021.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the materiel solution for replacement of the Army's Armored Personnel Carrier (M113) Family of Vehicles (FoV) within the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). It will mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability across the Spectrum of Conflict. The AMPV will replace five mission roles currently performed by the M113 FoV by transferring the current M113 Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) to a new Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD) platform. In total, the AMPV FoV will account for approximately 30% of the ABCT's tracked fleet and consists of the following five variants:
1. Mission Command (MCmd) Vehicle: This platform enables effective mission command planning and execution for both the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and Tactical Command (TAC) Vehicle versions of the MCmd. It will host current Battle Command Systems, future replacements, and upgrades of hardware and software.
2. Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.
3. Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litters or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.
4. General Purpose (GP) Vehicle: This platform will operate throughout the battle space by conducting re-supply, maintenance, casualty evacuation, and other tasks within the formation.
5. Mortar Carrier (MC) Vehicle: This platform will provide immediate responsive fire support to conduct fast-paced offensive operations.

The AMPV program was initiated with a Capability Development Document (CDD) that was approved on 21 June 2013 and subsequently revised on 24 October 2016.
The CDD reflects a set of stable, technologically achievable requirements. A Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was held on 9 December 2014
and it was followed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) that was signed on 22 December 2014. The ADM approved MS B for the AMPV program and
entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. In addition, the ADM authorized the Army to proceed with award of the EMD prime contract,
which occurred on 23 December 2014 to BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments, L.P. (BAE). A subsequent ADM was issued on 26 September 2017 and it approved: a
revised acquisition documentation tailoring plan, revised Milestone C entrance criteria, and an increase in the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity to 551 vehicles
(to recognize the Army's desire for early fielding of AMPVs for the European Deterrence Initiative). An ADM was then issued on 1 November 2017 and it delegated
Milestone Decision Authority to the Secretary of the Army and re-designated AMPV as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program. The FY2020 planned program
primarily consists of initiation of Production Qualification Testing (PQT), Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOTE) planning, and the initiation of the Production
and Deployment phase Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). Prime contractor support will be required for testing and engineering and ensure adequate system
support packages will be available during the tests. Government test locations will be used for the tests and government personnel will be responsible for the overall
management of the efforts. An Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) took place on December 20, 2018 with the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) and
the Vice Chief Staff of the Army (VCSA). The meeting resulted in the approval of the AMPV to enter MS C and LRIP.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Prime contractor activities in FY2018 will consist of efforts that support the conduct of system level tests and efforts that are necessary as a result of the tests. In addition, the contractor will continue work related to Logistics/Product Support. All 29 prototypes will undergo testing in FY2018, with tests often occurring simultaneously at multiple locations. The contractor will support these tests by providing Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to assist in repairing and maintaining the prototypes and by providing Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to troubleshoot any issues that might arise during testing. As required, the contractor will update the AMPV designs to address any shortcomings that are uncovered during testing or to incorporate any updates to government performance requirements. A Corrective Action Period (CAP) is planned for late 1QFY2018 through late 2QFY2018. During the CAP, the contractor will incorporate any design changes that are deemed necessary. An Interim Design Review (IDR) will be conducted at the conclusion of the CAP. The IDR will demonstrate that design changes made after the CDR are baselined and the system design is ready for manufacturing. A minimum of seventeen (17) artifacts will be generated by the contractor in support of IDR. Additional system level testing will take place following the CAP. At least 9,950 miles (not including contractor shakedown testing) will accrue during formal government testing prior to the CAP and at least an additional 9,500 miles will accrue following the CAP. Following completion of the post-CAP system level tests, a Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) will occur 4QFY2018. During the FCA, the contractor will demonstrate that the as-tested performance of the vehicles complies with design and interface requirements. Immediately following the FCA, the contractor will support the Limited User Test (LUT) in 4QFY2018. Eighteen (18) of the prototypes will be used during the LUT and the contractor will support the test by having FSRs and Test Engineers (TEs) on site and SMEs on call. Besides ensuring that the prototypes are adequately supported before and during testing, the contractor will provide all facilities, parts, tools, and other support items necessary to conduct a Logistics Demonstration (Log Demo) 2-4QFY2018. The contractor will validate the logistics support package prior to the Log Demo and will ensure that the nine (9) primary objectives of the Log Demo are achieved. The first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract option covers 52 vehicles, 10 of which (2 of each variant type) will support Full-Up System Level (FUSL) live fire testing. The recurring manufacturing cost associated with these 10 live fire assets will be Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funded, while the remaining 42 vehicles will be Procurement funded. Further, the live fire testing is scheduled to begin 2QFY2020 and the lead times associated with select hardware, such as electronic components, is expected to be such that some items must be procured as early as 3QFY2018. In accordance with the Full Funding Policy, the entire procurement cost of the live fire test assets is being budgeted in the fiscal year in which select items are initially procured. Accordingly, the FY2018 cost in this element includes the full recurring manufacturing cost necessary to procure 10 FUSL live fire test assets.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Prime contractor activities in FY2019 consisted of efforts that supported the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract. The contractor provided support of EMD testing activities at government test locations; including Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) testing at the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), system live fire testing of prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), and Limited User Testing (LUT) at a location to be determined. All testing activities were completed by the end of 1QFY2019. As required, the contractor analyzed the results of the testing program and incorporated any necessary design changes into selected prototypes. In addition to test support, the contractor completed a System Verification Review / Production Readiness Review (SVR/PRR) 1QFY2019. The SVR/PRR is a formal examination of the program to ensure that the AMPV design is ready for production and that the contractor has accomplished adequate production planning. As part of the AMPV design assessment, the contractor may also evaluate the capabilities of the AMPV design to satisfy other emerging Army requirements. Based on all engineering design work completed under the EMD contract, the contractor will also complete and deliver a final Technical Data Package (TDP). A final significant area of effort for the prime contractor during the EMD contract is continued work related to Logistics Support. This includes completion of the Logistics Demonstration, completion of the entire Technical Manual validation, and the start of Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) verification. In addition, and in support of Milestone C, the contractor will support an update to the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), completion of the Product Support Business Case Analysis, completion of the Depots Source of Repair (DSOR) Analysis, completion of the Core Depot Assessment (CDA), and completion of the Item Unique Identification (IUID) Plan. Following completion of Milestone C (completed 1QFY2019), the program will exercise the existing option for the first year of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP-1). Under the LRIP-1 contract option, the prime contractor will provide support to planned Production Qualification Testing (PQT) and, therefore, this element also includes costs related to PQT support. FY2019 prime contractor efforts will include support to PQT planning and the identification/procurement of System Support Packages (SSPs) that will be required for PQT. Also in support of PQT, the Government will procure selected mission equipment for the PQT test articles.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Prime contractor activities in FY2020 consist of efforts that support Production Qualification Testing (PQT), the Production and Deployment phase Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E), Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) planning, and potential design efforts to address changes stemming from the tests and/or to satisfy other emerging Army requirements. PQT is scheduled to begin 2QFY2020 and is planned to conclude 3QFY2021. Prior to the start of testing, the contractor will conduct a system level 250 mile shakedown test of each of the Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) vehicles. During the PQT, the contractor will provide test/engineering support and field service representatives at the Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), the Yuma Test Center (YTC), and at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) as well as Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC), and Dugway Proving Grounds (DPG).  In addition, the contractor will conduct Operator New Equipment Training (OPNET) and Field Level Maintenance New Equipment Training (FLMNET) prior to the start of PQT. This includes all necessary equipment and materials to conduct the training. Finally, as required, the contractor will maintain and replenish the System Support Packages (SSPs) needed to complete testing. The LFT&amp;E effort is intended to satisfy the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2366 (Major systems and munitions programs: survivability testing and lethality testing required before full-scale production). Two of each variant will be subject to the LFT&amp;E and costs included in this element are the support costs provided by the AMPV prime contractor. As is the case for the PQT, the contractor will provide support personnel at the primary test location (Aberdeen Test Center). The goal is to return each vehicle to a near operational condition after each live fire shot. The contractor must ensure that system support packages include adequate spare and repair parts. As required, the contractor will support government personnel in repairing each vehicle prior to the subsequent shot. Costs in this element also include those contractor program management efforts necessary to oversee the above described activities.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Government test costs in FY2020 are primarily related to Production Qualification Testing (PQT) and the Production and Deployment phase Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). Both PQT and the LFT&amp;E are scheduled to begin 3QFY2020 and will conclude 4QFY2021. Currently, a total of 25 vehicles will undergo Production Qualification Testing. As part of PQT, and in support of Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) assessments, six vehicles will run a total of 14,000 miles. The miles will be equally split between the Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) and the Yuma Test Center (YTC). An additional 19 vehicles will undergo performance testing as part of PQT. This testing will be performed at ATC, YTC, White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC), and Dugway Proving Grounds (DPG). PQT is conducted with production-representative vehicles from LRIP. The objectives include verification that the production-representative systems meet performance requirements, generation of data to support the system evaluation in support of the Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision, and determination of system readiness to enter Initial Operational Testing (IOT). Government costs include all costs incurred at the test sites and costs associated with Government personnel that will be collecting/analyzing test data, as well as personnel associated with providing oversight of the test activities. The LFT&amp;E will yield information to complement earlier vulnerability tests and modeling and analysis efforts, and will be used to fill data voids from prior testing. It will validate ballistic and blast performance at the system level to completely evaluate vehicle, crew, and occupant survivability. Ten vehicles will undergo testing at ATC and there are three elements to the testing: Controlled Damage Experimentation (CDE), Fire Survivability Testing, and Full-up System Level (FUSL) testing. CDE will be conducted on selected subsystems integrated into the AMPV to determine the consequences of various types of damage. This information will be used to confirm the impact of subsystem damage on platform functionality. Fire Survivability Testing will generate the data required to evaluate the effectiveness of the Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) to protect crews and internal and stowed equipment from fires expected to be initiated by ballistic impacts. FUSL testing will demonstrate the ballistic resiliency and crew survivability of fully functional, production-representative, combat-loaded AMPV variants and investigate the synergistic effects of various damage mechanisms and failure modes. Government costs include all costs incurred at ATC and costs associated with Government personnel that will be collecting/analyzing test data, as well as personnel associated with providing oversight of the test activities. Finally, as required, vehicle design updates incorporated as corrective actions may be proven out on modified prototype vehicles at select Government test locations. All Government costs incurred as a result of these tests are included in this element.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE).

This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>IGSSR-C provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts.

The IGSSR-C program received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015, and achieved a Milestone B decision on 29 Sep 2017.

The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was approved on 5 December 2016 by the MDA, which approved plans to leverage a contract through the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to develop, integrate and test the software solution to meet the IGSSR-C requirements.

Milestone C is planned for 2QFY21</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Joint Tactical Networking Center is funded by all the Services. The Joint Funding Strategy requires each of the three Service Military Departments (MILDEPs) to budget for one-third of the total program approved requirement.  Army funding in FY 2021 and beyond reflects only approximately one-third of total funding.  Other funding is as follows (PB20 locked positions):

Navy RDTE: 0605030N, 3077.                FY 2021 = 4,644 // FY 2022 = 4,741 // FY 2023 = 4,835 // FY 2024 = 4,932
Air Force RDTE:  0605030F, 655068.     FY 2021 = 5,737 // FY 2022 = 5,852 // FY 2023 = 5,969 // FY 2024 = 6,088

Due to Joint Funding Strategy, there is no prior year funding for JTNC in the other Service lines. Prior to the year of execution, the JTNC funding is consolidated in Army
PE 0605030A for execution. In accordance with the Joint Tactical Networking Center Charter updated and re-validated on 29 March 2016, the JTNC will remain under a Joint Budget Strategy funded by the three MILDEPs.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Tactical Networking Center is classified as a Joint Support Program to Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (AT&amp;L), DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), and the Services. JTNC core functions as defined in the JTNC Acquisition Decision Memorandum and Charter signed on 20 January 2014 and revalidated on 29 March 2016 include: Department of Defense (DoD) Waveform Information Repository (IR) management and configuration control, DoD Waveform Standards and Software Communications Architecture (SCA), technical analyses of Government Program of Record (POR) and Industry COTS and NDI Waveform products. The services derived from these core functions reinforce an acquisition environment which ensures that interoperable, secure, and affordable joint tactical waveforms and wireless communications applications can operate in a variety of hardware transport solutions.

The FY2020 Budget supports continued development/maturation of the DoD Waveform IR, analysis of directed software and artifacts, support of the National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial Communications Security (COMSEC) Evaluation Program (CCEP), JTNC Standards Interface Control Working Group (ICWG), and continue development of the Capabilities Characterization and Tactical Communications Marketplace (CC &amp; TCM).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>As part of the joint program budget strategy for Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM), each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&amp;E funds for joint efforts. Joint funding is programmed in the Navy PE 0605030N and Air Force PE 0605030F. Prior to submission of the President's Budget, the funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) for execution.

NOTE:
The Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) of 20 Jan 2014 officially chartered the JTNC, assigned responsibility for the development and sustainment of JENM to the PM Joint Tactical Networks (JTN), and transitioned waveform development and sustainment to the Services. The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Command Control Communications Tactical (C3T) Memos of 25 Jun 2015 transferred all program, development, and configuration control of JENM from Product Manager (PdM) JENM under PM JTN to the Army as Lead service under PdM Tactical Cyber Network Operations (TCNO) under PM Tactical Network (formally PM WIN-T). Waveform development transferred to PM Tactical Radios, who is responsible for program of record development.

JENM, funded in project EF5, is a software only program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>EF5 project: In support of Line of Effort (LOE) 1B, Network Enabling Functions, JENM software provides a single network management tool for the Warfighter to plan, configure, load, and manage the Joint Services' Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and networks in the field, a capability not available in legacy planning systems. JENM configures numerous Tactical radios such as the ManPack and Rifleman, enabling them to utilize the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) waveforms such as the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA), Integrated Waveform (IW), and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveforms. Furthermore, JENM provides the Commander the ability to quickly reconfigure critical networks using its Over the Air Management (OTAM) functionality. JENM enhances the S6's ability to conduct Course of Action (COA) Analysis and the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) providing commanders critical information regarding their ability to effectively communicate.  JENM is deployed on the Joint Tactical Networking Environment NetOps Toolkit (J-TNT) from Division to the Company level based upon the Basis of Issue Plan.

EX6 project: Beginning in FY 2018, based on the results of the FY 2017 Army Network Analysis, the EX6 project refocused efforts to improve waveforms for lower and mid-tier networks.  The effort focuses on development to achieve improved performance, network simplification, improved spectrum efficiency and improved Electronic Warfare (EW)/Cyber resistance.  The planned waveforms may include changes to a mid-tier waveform, SRW 2.0/Narrow Band, and SINCGARS upgrades.  This new capability must be completed by FY20-21 to support future tactical radio procurements.  

FY 2020 Base RDTE dollars in the amount of $40.808 million supports the continued development of the Waveforms and JENM, testing support and the program management office.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

For FY 2018 and out, the continuing JTN efforts are funded in Army PE 0605031A (JTN), Navy PE 0605031N (shared), Air Force PE 0605031F (shared) and USMC (Marine Corps Communications Systems - MCPC: 112107).  As part of the JENM joint program budget strategy, the Air Force and Army budget for approximately one-third each of the total program funds for JENM efforts.  The Navy and USMC funding combined equal the other third of the JENM program funding.  Prior to the year of execution, Navy and Air Force funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) and software sustainment funds are realigned from RDT&amp;E to O&amp;M,A PE (4326750A) to support the joint program acquisition strategy.  USMC funding will be provided on an annual basis via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).  USMC funding projections are as follows: FY20 - $1.121M; FY21 - $1.139M and FY22 - $0.927M.

JENM is a software only program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>EF5 project: The Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) software provides a single network management tool for the Warfighter to plan, configure, load, and manage the Joint Services' Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and networks in the field, a capability not available in legacy planning systems. JENM configures numerous Tactical radios such as the ManPack and Rifleman, enabling them to utilize the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) waveforms such as the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA), Integrated Waveform (IW), and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveforms. Furthermore, JENM provides the Commander the ability to quickly reconfigure critical networks using its' Over the Air Management (OTAM) functionality. JENM enhances the S6's ability to conduct Course of Action (COA) Analysis and the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) providing commanders critical information regarding their ability to effectively communicate.  JENM is deployed on the Joint Tactical Networking Environment NetOps Toolkit (J-TNT) from Division to the Company level based upon the Basis of Issue Plan. 

The Army will pivot away from JENM to new prototyping activities for emerging Tactical Radio and planning requirements for a simplified workflow based planning solution that leverages COTS capabilities to rapidly meet emerging needs from the Network CFT &amp; ITN.

FY 2020 Base RDTE dollars supports the continued development of the JENM software, testing support, and the program management office.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Waveforms program supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 1, Unified Network

In order to support the overall connectivity for the Unified Network, PdM Waveforms mission execution provides the transport technologies allowing soldiers to better communicate between echelons. PdM Waveforms' technology assessments, integration, and configuration management enable more fluid and swift updates to the Unified Network capabilities by focusing on the Soldier's mission and safety.

PdM Waveforms delivers, maintains, and upgrades portable, interoperable, mobile ad hoc networking waveforms (MANET), advance networking waveforms, and network enterprise services to enhance tactical warfighting capabilities. PdM Waveforms provides the Lower Tactical Internet with a suite of waveforms and network services that are: (1) Interoperable - used by all Services; (2) Capable of operating on a variety of hardware platforms, both Program of Record and non-developmental commercial radios; (3) Secure - meet all Department of Defense and US Government information assurance requirements; (4) Operationally relevant - quickly and effectively meet evolving network mission requirements of Combatant Commanders and the Services; and (5) Affordable - drive down procurement and support costs via a robust, competitive market which adheres to open government standards.  

PdM Waveforms will remain agile to accommodate emerging warfighter needs by refocusing effort strategies to address the following:

  - Work with Industry Partners to assess, analyze, and vet Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) waveforms in support of the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN)  
  - Pursue alternative waveforms to reduce the complexity of MANET
  - Improve spectral efficiency
  - Seek Electronic Counter-Counter Measure (ECCM) improvements for operations in contested environment
  - Implement improvements that allow the tactical radios to be operated in a radio silence mode.

FY 2020 Base RDTE dollars in the amount of $25.484 million supports the continued development of the waveforms, testing support, and the program management office.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Software Development efforts within PdM Waveforms are focused on the following:

1.	Cyber Electro-magnetic Activities (CEMA)
CEMA activities focus on impact the adversary?s ability to communicate through voice and data communications.  This also includes protecting and hardening Army capabilities and systems to prevent the adversary from doing the same.  CEMA is not limited to voice and data communications, but also includes tactics such as deception and adversary communication extraction.
CEMA consist of:
     - Cyberspace and Cybersecurity Operations
          * Focused on IP traffic (data)
          * Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention of Army networks within Tactical Radio platforms
     - Electronic Warfare (EW) 
          * Focused on Radio Frequency (RF/voice)
          * Electronic Attack (EA)
          * Electronic Protection (EP)
          * Electronic Survivability (ES)
          * Includes Anti-jam protection and deployment
     - Spectrum Management Operations (SMO).
          * Development of capabilities for the warfighter to maintain communication in spectrum denied environments.

2.	SINCGARS
Development of a Frequency Hopping (FH3) mode, which will address the adversary's EA capabilities.
Development of transmission security protocols.

3.	Warrior Robust Enhanced Network (WREN) (formerly know as Soldier Radio Waveforms (SRW) Narrowband) Integration
Development of WREN and the integration of Narrowband Code into the SRW baseline support the following warfighter capability gaps:
     - Availability of adequate spectrum to deploy a full Brigade Combat Team of subnets is increasingly becoming a problem in combat environments.
     - Enhance Scalability and longer distances between communication nodes. 
     - Maintaining communication capabilities in foliage-heavy environments.
     - Operation in VHF and UHF bands with narrower bandwidths.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PdM Waveforms is responsible for common core activities including developing and updating legacy and analyzing advance network waveforms that operate on multiple radios sets and in all operational environments that support network-centric operational warfare.  Waveform developments (upgrading, developing, and maintaining) will generally be procured through full and open contract competitions.

Beginning in FY19, while maintaining legacy networking waveforms, PdM Waveforms implemented a pivoting strategy which focuses on vetting and analyzing commercial/ NDI waveforms. The Product Office has established great working relationships with Industry Partners within the waveform market. The strategy consist of conducting upfront analysis on commercial waveforms to inform Senior Leaders before a porting decision is made.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The GBOSS-E Capability Design Document (CDD) was AROC approved May 2014. In FY 2013, FY 2014 &amp; FY 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities.

GBOSS-E received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  Milestone B decision accomplished 29 Sep 2017, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's GBOSS-E program requirements.

The acquisition strategy for GBOSS-E was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 11 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Security System (TSS) is a modular, scalable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground based security and surveillance Family of Systems (FoS). The design of TSS allows for hasty emplacement and is tailorable to support short and long term security, surveillance and detection missions. The TSS and its components are designed to be employed as a stand-alone system, in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection (FP) systems. Integration with additional sensors will be obtained through network communications and software in line with Net-Ready requirements. TSS will address four of the five base camp core protection/security capabilities identified in the Integrated Base Defense (IBD) Concept of Operations (CONOPS) which are perimeter security, entry control, persistent surveillance, warning and alerting. The TSS will be compliant with the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture and Implementation Plan. TSS is designed to be employed as a stand-alone system in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection systems including motion, acoustic, seismic, surface, and detection technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The TSS is a modular, scalable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground based security and surveillance Family of Systems (FoS). The design of TSS allows for hasty emplacement and is tailorable to support short and long term security, surveillance and detection missions. The TSS and its components are designed to be employed as a stand-alone system, in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection (FP) systems. Integration with additional sensors will be obtained through network communications and software in line with Net-Ready requirements. TSS will address four of the five base camp core protection/security capabilities identified in the Integrated Base Defense (IBD) Concept of Operations (CONOPS) which are perimeter security, entry control, persistent surveillance, warning and alerting. The TSS will be compliant with the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture and Implementation Plan. TSS is designed to be employed as a stand-alone system in a layered effort or integrated with additional force protection systems including motion, acoustic, seismic, surface, and detection technologies.

FY 2020 Base Funding in the amount of $6.928 million supports the procurement of three Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Articles and conduct of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSS will eliminate the Non-Standard Equipment (NSE) currently used in the Force Protection Suite (FPS) under the Base Expeditionary Targeting and Surveillance System - Combined (BETSS-C) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with improved surveillance capabilities in modular configurations along with enhanced network integration across the command and control system and Common Operating Environment (COE). 

Tactical Security System (TSS) received Materiel Development Decision (MDD) approval on 6 January 2017.  The acquisition concept and contracting strategy for TSS was approved on 30 April 2018 by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to leverage an existing task order through Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide engineering and developmental support for the TSS design, development, and integration of an EDM and to support Operational Assessments (OA). Key efforts include the development of the EDM, testing and evaluation for TSS Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)/Key System Attributes (KSAs)/Additional Performance Parameters (APAs), and Developmental and Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E).  MS B was achieved on 29 October 2018.

Milestone C is planned for FY 2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) budget line includes CIRCM (EB4), and funding to counter emerging technology as identified in Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) SO-0010 Phase 2a and the Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Directed Requirement for the Common Infrared Countermeasures Quick Reaction Capability (CIRCM QRC) approved Nov 2018.  

CIRCM (EB4)
The CIRCM is the next generation lightweight, laser-based Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) component that will interface with both the Army's Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and future Missile Warning Systems (MWS) to defeat current and emerging missile threats that use multispectral technology for rotary-wing, tilt-rotor and small fixed-wing aircraft across the DoD.  CIRCM receives an angular bearing hand-off from the MWS, employs a pointing and tracking system which acquires the handed-over threat and tracks the incoming missile during and after motor burnout. CIRCM jams the missile by using modulated laser energy in the missile seeker band, thus degrading the tracking capability of the missile and causing it to miss the aircraft.  CIRCM is utilizing Open Systems Architecture which allows flexibility with software and hardware refreshes to keep pace with future threats.  

The CIRCM A-Kit includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.  The A-Kit
ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.  The CIRCM B-Kit is the mission kit (laser, pointer tracker, and
controller) required to achieve near spherical coverage for an aircraft.

JUONS SO-0010 and CIRCM QRC
As a part of Phase 2a of the JUONS (SO-0010) program, the Army has now integrated the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system onto the Apache, Blackhawk, and Chinook platforms.  Due to a number of challenges, circumstances, and variables, the Army updated the ATW/CIRCM QRC and LIMWS Directed Requirements (dated 16 November 2018).  The updated requirements extend the utilization of ATW DoN LAIRCM on conventional Army aircraft and cancel the need for the ATW/CIRCM QRC system for the conventional Army.  (It should be noted that the updated requirement maintains the need for ATW/CIRCM on the Special Operations aircraft.)  As a result, the Army will no longer acquire the ATW sensors for use in Phase 3 of the JUONS effort.  Instead, the Army will accelerate the procurement of the CIRCM QRC systems for use with the currently fielded Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) in preparation for transition to the Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) system when available.

FY 2020 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding in the amount of 34.488 million will fund development, integration and test activities.

FY 2020 RDT&amp;E Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the amount of $11.770 million will fund development, integration and test activities for JUONS QRC in support of Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO) and CMWS/CIRCM in support of conventional Army.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) budget line includes CIRCM (EB4), and funding to counter emerging technology as identified in Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) SO-0010 Phase 2a and the Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Directed Requirement for the Common Infrared Countermeasures Quick Reaction Capability (CIRCM QRC) approved in Nov 2018.  

CIRCM (EB4)
The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) is the next generation lightweight, laser-based Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) component that will interface with
both the Army's Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and future missile warning systems (MWS) to defeat current and emerging missile threats that use multispectral technology for rotary-wing, tilt-rotor and small fixed-wing aircraft across the DoD.  CIRCM receives an angular bearing hand-off from the MWS, employs a pointing and tracking system which acquires the handed-over threat and tracks the incoming missile during and after motor burnout. CIRCM jams the missile by using modulated laser energy in the missile seeker band, thus degrading the tracking capability of the missile and causing it to miss the aircraft.  CIRCM is utilizing Open Systems Architecture which allows flexibility with software and hardware refreshes to keep pace with future threats.  

The CIRCM A-Kit includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.  The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.  The CIRCM B-Kit is the mission kit (laser, pointer tracker, and controller) required to achieve near spherical coverage for an aircraft.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The December 28, 2011, Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) authorized entry into the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, designated the program a pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), and approved the updated exit criteria.  The August 25, 2015, DAE ADM authorized entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and designated the program as a MDAP.  The EMD contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) on August 28, 2015.  The EMD contract includes priced options for Other Platform A-Kit Development, A-Kit Engineering Support, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 and 2 Prototypes (Hardware and Installs), LRIP 1 and 2 Engineering and Test Support, Software Technical Data Package (TDP), Navy funded requirements, and Defense Exportability Features (DEF).  CIRCM MS C was approved September 14, 2018, the LRIP and Engineering Support options were exercised and the program entered the Production &amp; Deployment phase with First Unit Equipped (FUE) planned for third quarter of FY 2020, and a Full Rate Production Decision Review (FRPDR) planned for the third quarter of FY 2020.

Due to the urgency of addressing the Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) issues related to the Phase 2a JUONS SO-0010 DoN LAIRCM initial materiel solution, the Army approved a Directed Requirement for the Phase 3 ATW/CIRCM QRC (requirement updated in November 2018) which will be a sole source QRC effort with Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman has the required technical capabilities, knowledge and special equipment to meet the urgent and compelling need for the Phase 3 CIRCM QRC effort.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Man-Portable Radiological Detection System (MRDS) capability will provide increased radiological and nuclear (RN) detection, localization, presumptive identification and field-confirmatory identification capabilities that are networked to provide situational awareness at the tactical level. The MRDS will support Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Interdiction and Elimination operations, specifically RN Sensitive Site Assessments and Sensitive Site Exploitation. The MRDS program will replace low density legacy COTS equipment while providing new equipment to much of the Chemical Biological RN (CBRN) force.  The Joint Personal Dosimeter (JPD-I) is intended to replace Army's legacy dosimeters (Army's PDR-75A reader with the DT-236 watch). The JPD-I will provide a sensor to record and retrieve a Service member's radiation exposure from occupational to tactical levels. Future capability may also support Reconnaissance and Surveillance across the full range of CWMD operations. This capability supports Radiological and Nuclear Interdiction (RNI) and Weapons of Mass Destruction - Elimination (WMD-E) operations to: systematically locate, secure, characterize, and disable WMD programs and related capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Man-portable Radiological Detection System is a single step acquisition strategy starting at Milestone C to acquire Commercial-Off-The-Shelf equipment sets consisting of a Hands-Free search device, a Hand-Held Radioisotope Identification Device, an integrated tactical radio network, and a Situational Awareness tool in order to provide specialized Army units with a net-ready, rugged, and reliable system that can detect, identify, and characterize designated radionuclides and transmit that information securely to tactical, operational, and strategic command levels in near-real time. The contract approach will be a full and open fixed price contract for LRIP systems to support post Milestone C testing, and an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity fixed price contract for the full rate production task order.  The level of technological maturity is such that MRDS entered the acquisition cycle from MDD at MS C (FY18). The program is working toward a Full Rate Production Decision in 4th Qtr FY20 concurrent with a Full Rate Production Contract Award.

The Joint Personal Dosimeter - Individual (JPD-I) Program Office (PO) will leverage the Navy's market research, testing and down select to meet the Army's requirements.  The level of technological maturity is such that JPD-I entered the acquisition cycle from MDD at MS C (FY18).  A Full Rate Production Decision in 1st Qtr FY19 was made concurrent with a Full Rate Production Contract Award.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicles (NBCRV) Sensor Suite Upgrade (SSU) provides maneuver formations the ability to conduct mounted reconnaissance and surveillance missions of CBRN named areas of interest (NAIs).  The NBCRV SSU will answer the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIR), and facilitate proactive risk-based decisions to ensure freedom of action and survivability.  A modern and capable NBCRV SSU is a critical component for Joint Force success when operating in the complex CBRN environment.  Operating with combat vehicles fighting against increasingly capable and determined enemies requires like capability with regard to protection, mobility, and lethality.  The NBCRV SSU will accomplish this by integrating the capability for command and control of unmanned systems with CBRN payload.  The NBCRV SSU will provide a CBRN detection, tipping and queueing to accomplish desired standoff distances to keep the warfighter out of harm's way and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.  A Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuver speed when conducting NBC missions and increase reliability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite Upgrade (NBCRV SSU) is an upgrade for the Stryker NBCRV.  The acquisition strategy for the Stryker NBCRV SSU is to integrate mature sensors into the Stryker NBCRV in FY19 for demonstration in Joint Warfighting Assessment (JWA) 19 and system level testing FY 2019.  Following the testing and demonstration, the hardware and software will be fixed and updated for demonstration in JWA 20 and test in FY 2020.  An In Progress Review will be held in late FY 2020 to execute a Modification Work Order for fielding in FY 2021.  This schedule was accelerated from the previous schedule based on the maturity of the sensor and guidance from the Chief of Staff of the Army.  The NBCRV SSU program will conduct system level testing in FY 2021 using Defense Wide funding after the Modification Work Order In Process Review to ensure system performance.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defensive Cyber Tool Development (DCTD) and Cyber Situational Understanding (SU) fall within Line of Effort (LOE) 1 of the Network Modernization Strategy framework, which incorporates cyber capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.

Overall, Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and Cyber SU provide the tools and insight to proactively protect and defend the network at the tactical and strategic levels, thereby enabling the network to operate unfettered from the threat of cyberattacks.

CY5 Cyber SU:

Cyber SU supports Cyber Electromagnetic Activity (CEMA) operations by providing visualization of CEMA information to improve planning, coordination, integration and synchronization of cyberspace operations and unified land operations. 

Cyber SU provides the Brigade to Corps commanders the visualization of physical (geographically), logical (at a specific network internet protocol), and cyber persona layers (bad actors, from individuals to nation states) of cyberspace based on data/information from multiple sources and sensors to produce a CEMA overlay on the commander's Common Operational Picture (COP) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE). Supporting CEMA, Cyber SU synchronizes and integrates red (enemy), grey (commercial/private sector) and blue (friendly) cyberspace data, and enables collaboration at the tactical echelon. Further, in support of the Military Decision Making Process (planning and decision cycles), Cyber SU provides tactical commanders with a broad understanding of CEMA threats by informing the commander of any cyber related impacts to physical domains, unified land operations, and the overall mission. 

EV5 DCO:

The DCO group of programs develops, assesses, deploys, learns, and iterates essential cyberspace warfighting capabilities consisting of solutions based upon an infrastructure, platform, and tool/payload approach. DCO capabilities are required in order to actively predict and conduct reconnaissance (search and discover) against advanced cyberspace threats (to include insider threats) and vulnerabilities that do not trigger or generate warnings using routine security measures. Additionally, DCO capabilities allow the Army to outmaneuver adversaries by performing preapproved, automated, agile, internal countermeasures that stop or mitigate cyberspace attacks. Moreover, DCO capabilities enable the Army to conduct cyberspace defense mission planning and protection that identifies and assures the availability of tasked critical assets and infrastructure supporting Army, DOD, host nation, and civil authority actions or missions. The overall objective is to achieve survivability of networks, IT platforms, and data through counter-mobility actions, dynamic movement of tasked critical assets, and security enhancement measures. This assures commanders from U.S. Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and other Army Service Component Commands Brigade through Corp down to the tactical level can execute national, joint, and/or Army operational and tactical missions. These capabilities enable ARCYBER to support U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and defend all Army networks as part of its Service-retained responsibilities. DCO capabilities also enable Army National Guard and Reserve forces to support USC Title 10 missions under the auspices of ARCYBER or other major commands. 

DCO supports material solutions aligned to requirements outlined in the 26 October 2016 Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Defensive Cyberspace Operations Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD). DCO related infrastructure, platforms, and tools/payloads enable the Army to maneuver, conduct reconnaissance, execute counter-mobility actions, and command and control DCO people, processes, and technologies within friendly cyberspace. DCO programs will allow near real-time employment of passive and active measures to preserve the ability to utilize friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems. These programs directly support USCYBERCOM Integrated Priority List #2 Produce Advanced Cyberspace Infrastructure and #5 Defensive Forces to execute passive and active defense operations at net-speed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyber SU falls within Line of Effort (LOE) 1 (Unified Network) of the Network Modernization Strategy framework, which incorporates cyber capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.

CY5 Cyber SU:

Cyber SU supports Cyber Electromagnetic Activity (CEMA) operations by providing visualization of CEMA information to improve planning, coordination, integration and synchronization of cyberspace operations and unified land operations. 

Cyber SU provides the Brigade to Corps commanders the visualization of physical (geographically), logical (at a specific network internet protocol), and cyber persona layers (bad actors, from individuals to nation states) of cyberspace based on data/information from multiple sources and sensors to produce a CEMA overlay on the commander's Common Operational Picture (COP) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE). Supporting CEMA, Cyber SU synchronizes and integrates red (enemy), grey (commercial/private sector) and blue (friendly) cyberspace data, and enables collaboration at the tactical edge. Further, in support of the Military Decision Making Process (planning and decision cycles), Cyber SU provides tactical commanders with a thorough understanding of CEMA threats by informing the commander of any cyber related impacts to physical domains, unified land operations, and the overall mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Cyber SU is an Information Technology (IT) Box program as outlined in the Cyberspace Situational Understanding (Cyber SU) Supporting Army Cyberspace Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS-ICD), which was approved 9 March 2018 (Army Requirements Oversight Council [AROC] Memorandum 18-13).  TCM Cyber is preparing Core Functionality and Understanding Cyberspace Requirement Definition Package (RDP) in support of Cyber SU. The RDP and subsequent Capability Drops (CDs) are to be approved by the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence in collaboration with U.S. Army Forces Command. Projected RDP approval is 29 January 2019 at the AROC Requirements Board. 

Cyber SU will field increasing capability to meet the RDPs and CDs over the program's life cycle. Development of the capability will be depend on several factors, including (but not limited to) availability of commercial and/or government-developed products and how easily the product(s) can be integrated. To that end, the program office intends to evaluate and leverage GOTS/COTS products to the greatest extent and potentially leverage cyber solutions developed by related programs and science and technology efforts (e.g., Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) and Tactical DCO Infrastructure) to satisfy the requirements detailed in the Cyber SU RDPs/CDs. The results of this analysis will inform the final decision on the acquisition strategy, which could include agile developer/operator (DEVOPS) and Section 804. Coordination and integration with complimentary programs and systems-the sources of cyber data feeds-will be an integral part of the program to ensure the data is made available to be consumed by the Cyber SU solution.

Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), approved the Materiel Development Decision on 20 June 2018. The entry point into the acquisition life cycle and projected timeline to a milestone decision will be proposed to the MDA upon receipt and review of the validated RDPs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) falls within Line of Effort (LOE) 1 of the Network Modernization Strategy framework, which incorporates cyber capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.

FY 2020 RDTE DCO efforts consists of the following critical capabilities:

-Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI): System (automated on boot infrastructure to deploy DCO Tools on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI)) which resides within the Command Post, at Brigade through Corps, for both organic Cyber Network Defenders as well as remote access by CPT to support defense of the tactical network (PEO C3T)
-Cyberspace Analytics (CA): Identification of threat trends, behavior patterns, and Techniques Tactics and Procedures (TTPs) relative to associated portions of the information environment. The cyberspace analytics capability offers an integrated platform that can be leveraged across all security enclaves (NIPRNET, SIPRNET, and JWICS) to enhance both DCO and Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) operations (PEO EIS)
-Mission Planning (MP): An application-based, scalable warfighting capability for Army DCO mission command and planning at the global, regional, and local levels. DCO MP enables integration, coordination, and synchronization of supported and supporting cyberspace defenders (PEO EIS)
-Tools Suite: Flexible and dynamic suite of warfighting capabilities that enable Cyber Mission Forces and other cyberspace defenders to perform functional categories consisting of site survey; risk assessment; observation; intel support; counter-mobility; developer/operator (DEVOPS), event correlation, and command and control (PEO EIS)
-Garrison DCO Platform (GDP): Prepositioned, dedicated compute and storage resources residing at high/extremely high risk installations. Provides cyberspace defenders a remote maneuver capability in order to augment and/or support cyberspace defenders existing at designated bases, posts, camps, or stations by preserving an organization's ability to utilize mission critical data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems (PEO EIS)
-Deployable DCO System (DDS): A deployable kit, with dedicated compute and storage for austere environments that do not have prepositioned infrastructure or locations for which prepositioned DCO resources do not provide adequate capacity. The DDS allows global cyberspace defenders (e.g. CPTs) the ability to jump into a network, physically, onsite and gain a position of advantage to augmenting organic local and/or regional cyberspace defenders (PEO EIS)
-User Activity Monitoring (UAM): The primary capability within the Army's overall insider threat detection (InT) program. UAM is a software-based, scalable solution that proactively identifies and mitigates internal risks associated with the theft and misuse of critical, mission essential data. UAM utilizes full-spectrum solutions to assess, deter, deny, defend, defeat, and evolve against the insider threat hub (PEO EIS)
-Forensics and Malware Analysis (F&amp;MA): Warfighting capability adheres to the global standard in digital investigation technology for global or regional cyberspace defenders who need to conduct efficient, forensically-sound, data collection and examination either remotely or locally using a repeatable and defensible process. Forensics gives cyberspace defenders the ability to  triage by quickly viewing and searching potential evidence in order to determine whether further examination is warranted (PEO EIS)
-Advanced Sensors: Real-time discovery of specific advanced or sophisticated cyber threats and vulnerabilities on a critical system or segment of the network. Advanced sensors provides an automated monitoring and incident handling capability lower in the network architecture (access layer) to conduct over-watch for high-risk units or systems that normally operate out of view ("last mile") from traditional security or DCO measures (PEO EIS)
-Threat Emulation: Software and hardware based suite of tools used by a Cyber OPFOR to gain access to evaluated networks and systems using multi-vectors of unknown ("blackbox"), partially known ("graybox"), or known ("whitebox") access methods. Enables the implementation of real world threat tactics, techniques, and procedures against risk areas in order to reveal extremely high-risk security exposures and demonstrate the operational impact of a potential attack (PEO EIS)
-Counter Infiltration: Software/hardware array of components that retrogrades mission critical assets from virtual areas under a cyber threat actor's control using stealth, deception, surprise, or clandestine movements. The capability allows commanders and leaders to trade space for time by slowing down the advanced persistent threat's without becoming decisively engaged (PEO EIS)
-Forge: Provides integration and assessment capabilities during the development and integration phases of operations. DCO program will leverage non-FAR based Other Transaction Authorities (OTA) to solicit prototype/new technologies for consideration of procurement decisions.
-Rapid Cyber Prototyping: Rapidly develops cyber capabilities identified by the Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) in order to counter advanced, persistent, and sophisticated cyber threats (ARCYBER)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Improvements will also include provisioning of graphical techniques to see patterns in data that might not otherwise be obvious. The Army will additionally increase the use of embedded capabilities consisting of tools that are integrated with other applications, operating as a component of the application rather than a separate platform. Critical to success is the maturation of DEVOPS and DEVOPS tools to support rapid cyberspace analytical development. Moreover, the Army will continue to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data residing on the platform by improving or adding identify and access management, as well as cross domain data transfer solutions.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>DCO Mission Planning (DCOMP) integrates network security requirements, intelligence, and vulnerability analyses, with a commander?s operation order (e.g. mission statement, commander?s intent, planning guidance, initial commander critical information requirements/essential elements of friendly information, and assumptions), and other military decision-making process outputs, and actions to identify key terrain in cyberspace and mission critical assets; determine probable attack vectors; and produce a set of relevant internal defense measures, triggers, and decision points. The result is the automated production of the appropriate operations order (OPORD) appendix, which is then war-gamed in a simulation engine for evaluation and improvement. DCOMP utilizes the final OPORD to rapidly provision necessary platforms so cyberspace defenders can execute mission in near real-time.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Continued improvements to DCOMP will include the ability to map a network with a commander's military or business operation in order to automate the identification of mission relevant terrain in cyberspace. This will support the insertion of a battle tracking capability that monitors mission execution and provides a status on mission performance and effectiveness. Additionally, the Army will seek to integrate a cross domain solution and develop a wargaming module (to include Persistent Cyber Training Range integration). Finally, development efforts will focus on the creation of a controller module that can take the output of the military decision making process and automatically array corresponding infrastructure, platforms, and tools against the mission in a way that readies the capabilities before the virtual or on-site arrival of cyberspace defenders. The Army will ensure the capability maintains access to applicable cyber symbology and geospatial information Infrastructure Controller.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The Army employs its tools within a prepositioned or deployable environment and organizes them by function. DCO tools are functionality aligned to identified performance characteristics. Functional categories consist of site survey; risk assessment; observation; intel support; counter-mobility; DEVOPS, event correlation, and command and control. Tools are encapsulated into purpose-built platforms: Publicly available security distributions (managed by open source teams outside of the Army?s direct control), virtual machines (VM) containing licensed tools (containerized with an operating system (OS) and vendor-licensed software installed), and Orchestrated VMs (VMs exist with just enough OS to be able to receive instructions from a host cloud computing OS). Facilitates evaluations and assessments in a closed, controlled repeatable environment on virtualized infrastructure of common services, toolsets, and/or platforms for simplifying and standardizing designs and processes, as well as codifying functions and services into an ontology.</r2:Description>

The initial capability will provide an automated surveillance and counter-mobility solution lower in the network architecture (access layer) to conduct over-watch for high-risk units or systems that normally operate out of view (?last mile?) from traditional, routine security or DCO measures. The primary measure of effectiveness for an advanced cyber sensor is real-time discovery of specific advanced or sophisticated cyber threats and vulnerabilities on a critical system or segment of the network. When a TTP is detected, advanced sensors can execute a myriad of tailored response actions (block, neutralize, deceive, redirect, etc.) on the associated payload. The result is an increased ability to interrupt the adversary at the beginning of the cyber kill chain by employing counter-measures during the reconnaissance and weaponization phases; and neutralizing and/or deceiving the adversary during the delivery, exploitation, and installation phases. To enable this approach, advanced cyber sensors incorporate indications and warnings (I&amp;W) algorithmically to provide identification and reporting of time-sensitive information on developments that could involve a threat to the network.</r2:Text>

The capability will change the identity of assets between relatively small time periods based on mathematical algorithms. Mission critical assets within the same virtual area of operations will share certain, common information, which results in an asset not only knowing it's next identity and location, but it is additionally aware of the next identity and location of all other mission critical systems. As time progresses, systems within the same Area of Operations retrograde in unison. Characteristics of a system that can change consist of Internet Protocol address, media access control address, ports, protocol, services, computer name, etc. The capability will allow commanders and leaders to trade space for time by slowing down the advanced persistent threat?s without becoming decisively engaged.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) will support multiple programs. The Army conducted Materiel Development Decisions (MDD) in FY18 based upon the DCO Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD). DCO will develop and integrate the DCO Suite of Complimentary Systems (DSCS) using an incremental evolutionary acquisition approach that employs iterative development and acquisition reform principals, complying with the 1996 Clinger-Cohen Act. The approach leverages prototyping using the Operational Needs Statement (ONS) high-level objectives as a bridging strategy to establish the acquisition programs. The DSCS was initiated via four (4) ONSs, which have transitioned into Program of Records (PORs).

System designs focus on open architecture and open source capabilities. Department will utilize Evolutionary Acquisition (Delivery, Assess, Deploy, Learn and Iterate). Implementation of a modular design to maximize innovation through continuous releases. Modules will be refined by industry as a component through adoption of prototypes. Each program will have a prime integrator (single contractor) that integrates the new modules. The Government will assess and create prototypes employing a combination of Government entities and commercial vendors via Other Transaction Authority contract vehicle.

The Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) program's MDD was conducted in 2QFY18. Based on the validated DCO IS ICD and the TDI Requirements Definition Package (RDP), the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) delegating TDI as an ACAT III program. TDI will leverage the Simplified Acquisition Plan (SAMP) approach and will use acquisition tailoring in preparing for MSB, scheduled for 3QFY19. To support the Department's evolutionary acquisition approach, the TDI program office will develop the software infrastructure and deployment scripts that provide a technological solution that is converged with the Tactical Server Infrastructure in a series of incremental builds to deliver capabilities that align with DCO priorities. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of government entities and commercial vendors.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Network Radio Systems (Low-Tier) supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 1, Unified Network

The HMS radios are a key component of the Integrated Tactical Network which supports a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide in any environment.  These radios will perform under a standards-based network architecture that unifies enterprise and deployed network capabilities.  The near-term goal of the HMS radios is to provide 'secure but unclassified' networking capabilities utilizing next generation tactical radios.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan.

The Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program is a materiel solution providing software-defined radio systems that are tailorable and scalable to support the Chief of Staff of the Army's "fight tonight" strategy. HMS is an Acquisition Category IC program that encompasses specific requirements to support the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs. 

HMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge/most disadvantaged warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight / Beyond Line of Sight capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radio systems are software reprogrammable, networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communications. 

HMS encompasses the Handheld Radios (one-channel Rifleman Radio and two-channel Leader Radio), Manpack Radio (MP), and Small Form Fit radios. HMS radios will provide voice and support for data services such as text, control graphics, imagery, video, and telemetry to Warfighters and tactical end user devices including handheld, embedded, and larger computing devices, as well as unmanned systems. The program office will continue with the ongoing competition to procure the newest generation of software defined radios capable of running the threshold waveforms, to include MUOS for MP, and will pursue alternative waveforms to reduce the complexity of Mobile AdHoc Networking waveforms, improve spectral efficiency, and seek Electronic Counter-Countermeasures improvements for operations in a contested environment.

The Army intends to test and integrate 2-channel communications technologies, utilizing existing Army 2-channel radio variants (HMS Radios), in support of Air to Ground experimentation. Experimentation includes, but not limited to: concept refinement, characterization, data collection, demos, new kit prototyping, and operational assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Network Radio Systems (Low-Tier) supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 1, Unified Network

The HMS radios are a key component of the Integrated Tactical Network which supports a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide in any environment.  These radios will perform under a standards-based network architecture that unifies enterprise and deployed network capabilities.  The near-term goal of the HMS radios is to provide 'secure but unclassified' networking capabilities utilizing next generation tactical radios.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan.

HMS is structured as a single program of record consisting of several products. The Manpack (MP) radio is a NSA certified Type 1 radio used for transmission of up to SECRET information. The MP is capable of providing two simultaneous channels of secure voice and data communications using SINCGARS, Demand Assigned Multiple Access Satellite Communication, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), and other advanced networking waveforms. The MP provides range extension and connects soldiers in the lower tier network to the mid-tier network. It is interoperable with legacy waveforms and capable of route and retransmission and cross-banding. The MP provides networking waveforms connectivity, Networked Line of Sight (LOS) / Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) voice and data communications. The MP will serve as the vehicular and man-packable tactical LOS / BLOS radio.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Manpack's Test and Evaluation focuses on the key technical and operational characteristics of the system: Radio Frequency performance, security, Reliability, Availability &amp; Maintainability, suitability and survivability requirements, in addition to operational environmental performance requirements as per the Capability Production Document. All radios awarded a contract were required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for a Customer Test (CT). Following CT there will be a Sandbox and Soldier Feedback Study and Field / Lab Based Risk Reduction Test (FBRR/LBRR) that will serve as risk reduction events prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers. The QT and CT are complete and were executed by Electronic Proving Ground. 

The QT validated the manufacturers' ability to meet the minimum functional requirements identified in the Performance Requirements Document. All vendors successfully demonstrated key capabilities during QT and proceeded to the CT. The Sandbox, Soldier Feedback Study and FBRR/LBRR will serve as risk reduction events for delayed thresholds and OT. The OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary / Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that HMS products meet warfighter needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from OT will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Network Radio Systems (Low-Tier) supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort 1, Unified Network

The HMS radios are a key component of the Integrated Tactical Network which supports a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide in any environment.  These radios will perform under a standards-based network architecture that unifies enterprise and deployed network capabilities.  The near-term goal of the HMS radios is to provide 'secure but unclassified' networking capabilities utilizing next generation tactical radios.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan.

HMS is structured as a single program of record consisting of several products. The HMS Handheld products encompass the one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR) and two-channel Leader Radio (LR). The RR is a handheld radio that connects soldiers at the lowest echelon of the Army network. It is a National Security Agency certified Type 1 radio used for transmission of up to SECRET information. The RR provides one-channel secure voice and data communications. It is the primary squad level communication system. The LR is a Multiband two-channel handheld radio to be used at the Team, Squad, and Platoon level. The LR will simultaneously support Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice interoperability and other advanced networking waveform communications, in one radio with both handheld and mounted configurations, for fixed and mobile sites.

On 13 September 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive approved a decreased Basis of Issue (BOI) for the single channel RR, an increase to the BOI for the two channel LR and moving forward with acquisition activities for the two channel LR. Single channel RR procurement is being deferred.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Handheld's Test and Evaluation focuses on the evaluation of key technical and operational characteristics of the system: Radio Frequency performance, security, Reliability, Availability &amp; Maintainability, and survivability requirements, in addition to operational environmental performance requirements as per the Capability Production Document. All radios awarded a contract will be required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for Field / Lab Based Risk Reduction (FBRR/LBRR) that will serve as risk reduction events prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers.

The QT will validate the manufacturers' ability to meet the minimum functional requirements identified in the Performance Requirements Document. Radios that successfully demonstrate key capabilities during QT will proceed to FBRR/LBRR. The OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary / Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that the HMS products meet warfighter needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from the OT will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 13 September 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive determined to decrease the Basis of Issue (BOI) for the single channel RR, increase the BOI for the two channel LR and move forward with acquisition activities for the two channel LR. Single channel RR procurement is being deferred. An acquisition strategy addendum adding LR was approved in March 2017. The addendum continues the multi-vendor approach utilizing the existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) RR base contract (awarded 29 April 2015) to on-ramp LR capabilities (18 September 2018). The LR effort is a separate competition under the Handheld radio suite. 

The LR will simultaneously run Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) and other advanced networking waveforms, in one radio with both handheld and mounted configurations, for fixed and mobile sites.

The Army will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:
a. Awarded FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (18 September 2018)
b. Awarded LRIP delivery orders to support SFAB and ITN fieldings/evaluations (18 September 2018)
c. Award LRIP delivery orders based on results the best value trade-off construct (3QFY19 &amp; 3QFY20)</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective February 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) for Defense Business Systems, applying to Army Contract Writing System (ACWS).  This DoDI supersedes DoDI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across DoD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), as outlined in DoDI  5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed" and replace DoDI 5000.02 "Milestones."  ACWS official MDA delegation to Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems was on 19 March 2018.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Contract Writing System (ACWS) will be the Army's single, next-generation, enterprise-wide contract writing, management, execution, and close-out software system. ACWS will facilitate the standardization of Army Procurement business processes and streamline the integration with Army Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. As a financial feeder system, ACWS will meet the compliance requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996. The system will meet the full scope of Army contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. This is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, the Army received an Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 29 October 2014. On 24 March 2016, the USD(AT&amp;L) signed the program's Request For Proposal (RFP) Release Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which designated ACWS as an unbaselined, Major Automated Information System Acquisition Category IAM program, and approved the Army's request to release an request for proposal to industry to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system. Since awarding a contract to CGI Federal Inc. on 22 May 2017, the program recently completed a robust risk reduction effort that aligned Army's business processes to the selected commercial-off-the-shelf product, and reduced unnecessary requirements and interfaces. In August 2018, program conducted a successful Baseline Authority to Proceed decision and obtained the Army Acquisition Executive's approval to award initial development task order. ACWS is on track to deploy a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS) to two pilot units in late FY 2019 / early FY 2020, and achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) NLT 3Q FY 2020.

ACWS was approved by The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) as one of the pilot programs supporting the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 873 Agile Pilots.  The duration of the ACWS 873 Pilot Program is planned through Full Development. As part of the Sec 873 activities ACWS is realigning and restructuring during the IOC development which will include a contract structure that enables Agile best practices and incremental capability delivery to the field.  ACWS, as Sec 873 Agile Pilot Program, will support OSD need to quickly identify lessons learned, reduce procedural delays, improve policy, and enhance workforce training.  Sec 873 Pilot Programs, such as ACWS, are intended to deliver greater capability to the Army rapidly and at lowered costs.  Sec 873 Pilot provides programs the opportunity to restructure in order to streamline contract and acquisition approaches and tear down barriers to agile development without penalty.  Lessons learned will be used to help shape agile policy, processes and tools for DoD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Contract Writing System (ACWS) will be the Army's single, next-generation, enterprise-wide contract writing, management, execution, and close-out software system. ACWS will facilitate the standardization of Army Procurement business processes and streamline the integration with Army ERP systems. As a financial feeder system, ACWS will meet the compliance requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996. The system will meet the full scope of Army contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. This is consistent with USD(AT&amp;L) memorandum; DoD Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, the Army received an OSD DCMO validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS MDD on 29 October 2014. On 24 March 2016, the USD(AT&amp;L) signed the program's RFP Release ADM which designated ACWS as an unbaselined, Major Automated Information System Acquisition Category IAM program, and approved the Army's request to release an request for proposal to industry to procure a COTS system. Since awarding a contract to CGI Federal Inc. on 22 May 2017, the program recently completed a robust risk reduction effort that aligned Army's business processes to the selected commercial-off-the-shelf product, and reduced unnecessary requirements and interfaces. In August 2018, program conducted a successful Baseline Authority to Proceed decision and obtained the Army Acquisition Executive's approval to award initial development task order. ACWS is on track to deploy a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS) to two pilot units in late FY 2019 / early FY 2020, and achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) NLT 3Q FY 2020.

ACWS was approved by The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) as one of the pilot programs supporting the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 873 Agile Pilots.  The duration of the ACWS 873 Pilot Program is planned through Full Development. As part of the Sec 873 activities ACWS is realigning and restructuring during the IOC development which will include a contract structure that enables Agile best practices and incremental capability delivery to the field.  ACWS, as Sec 873 Agile Pilot Program, will support OSD need to quickly identify lessons learned, reduce procedural delays, improve policy, and enhance workforce training.  Sec 873 Pilot Programs, such as ACWS, are intended to deliver greater capability to the Army rapidly and at lowered costs.  Sec 873 Pilot provides programs the opportunity to restructure in order to streamline contract and acquisition approaches and tear down barriers to agile development without penalty.  Lessons learned will be used to help shape agile policy, processes and tools for DoD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Primary capability achieved through ATDS is the agility necessary to rapidly react to evolving threats.

Justification:
FY 2020 Base Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $1.539 million funds enhanced market research and system engineering program management, and engineering support for an advanced missile warning system.  The program is evaluating candidate technologies capable of being developed and fielded to the US Army to protect aircraft from emerging Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Survivability Development budget line includes Aircraft Survivability Equipment Development (ER7) and Common Missile Warning System (ER8). This budget line also includes funding for Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) SO-0010 Phase 2a, Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) Directed Requirement for the Advanced Threat Warner (ATW) portion of the  Phase 3 ATW/Common Infrared Countermeasures Quick Reaction Capability (ATW/CIRCM QRC), and the next generation missile warning system.

ER7: Aircraft Survivability Development.
The objective of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Development project is to improve Radio Frequency (RF) ASE for Army aviation. The APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) detects, categorizes, and prioritizes RF emitters and provides a visual / aural alert to aircrew members warning them of targeting by RF-guided weapons. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward. 

Phase 1, the APR-39C(V)1/4, serves as an obsolescence / sustainment upgrade to the Processor Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) of the AN/APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) implemented to ensure that the currently fielded system remains viable until affordable improved RF ASE capability can be pursued in Phases 2 and 3.

Phase 2A is RWR Modernization begins by adopting the United States Navy APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the RF threat coverage, automatic detection and identification of threat types, bearing, and lethality. Phase 2B, the APR-39E(V)2 (MRWR), is an Army Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the APR-39D(V)2 that will implement enhanced hardware and software upgrades to keep the APR-39 technically relevant against new and emerging agile threats.

Phase 3 adds active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) jamming capability for selected aircraft; Material Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM capability phase is not expected until later in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). 

Justification: FY 2020 Base RDT&amp;E funding of $58.772 million supports APR-39E(V)2 system development and prototyping.

ER8: Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).
The CMWS program is a missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming Inrared (IR)-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification, unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification, false alarm rejection, and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives ultraviolet (UV) missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS), which detect UV signals, and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures, including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM)-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition, the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding materiel release conditions to achieve a Full Materiel Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats.

The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, cables, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.

As a part of Phase 2a of the JUONS (SO-0010) program, the Army has now integrated the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system onto the Apache, Blackhawk, and Chinook platforms.  Due to a number of challenges, circumstances, and variables, the Army updated the ATW/CIRCM QRC and LIMWS Directed Requirements (dated 16 November 2018). The updated requirements extend the utilization of ATW DoN LAIRCM on conventional Army aircraft and cancel the need for the ATW/CIRCM QRC system for the conventional Army.  (It should be noted that the updated requirement maintains the need for ATW/CIRCM on the Special Operations aircraft.)  As a result, the Army will no longer acquire the ATW sensors for use in Phase 3 of the JUONS effort.  Instead, the Army will accelerate the procurement of the CIRCM QRC systems for use with the currently fielded Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) in preparation for transition to the Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) system when available.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC: Phase 4 LIMWS QRC addressess the HQDA Directed Requirement to provide a greater capability than the current Program of Record (POR), CMWS, to bridge the gap between CMWS and the future POR.

Justification:
CMWS: FY 2020 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $5.785 million funds threat and vulnerability analysis, and Systems Engineering Program Management (SEPM). 

Phase 3 Common Infrared Countermeasure Quick Reaction Capability (Phase 3, CIRCM QRC): FY 2020 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $2.220 million fund System Test &amp; Evaluation (ST&amp;E) and tech manual development.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC: FY2020 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $75.200 million are estimated to fund test of system and design for lead platform and development of follow-on platform designs.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Radio Frequency (RF) ASE is managed by Project Manager ASE (PM ASE) for development, testing, procurement, integration and installation on Army rotary wing and fixed wing Special Electronic Mission Aircraft (SEMA) aviation platforms. PM ASE proposed a three-phased path forward commensurate with user priorities and affordability considerations. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward.

Phase 1, the APR-39C(V)1/4,  addresses obsolescence/Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues associated with the currently fielded AN/APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) via sole source Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) awarded to the APR-39A(V) manufacturer.

Phase 2A adopts the United States Navy (USN) APR-39D(V)2 system, limiting service-unique design, test, and integration expenses. Adoption of the APR-39D(V)2 in limited quantity, followed by Phase 2B development, testing, procurement, and fielding of the APR-39E(V)2 will address the significant RF capability gap while avoiding additional up-front costs associated with a single-Service solution. 

Phase 3 will develop and integrate active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) jamming capability for selected aircraft.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CMWS program is a missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming Inrared (IR)-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification, unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification, false alarm rejection, and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives ultraviolet (UV) missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS), which detect UV signals, and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures, including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM)-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition, the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding materiel release conditions to achieve a Full Materiel Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats.

The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, cables, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.

As a part of Phase 2a of the JUONS (SO-0010) program, the Army has now integrated the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (DoN LAIRCM) system onto the Apache, Blackhawk, and Chinook platforms.  Due to a number of challenges, circumstances, and variables, the Army updated the ATW/CIRCM QRC and LIMWS Directed Requirements (dated 16 November 2018). 
The updated requirements extend the utilization of ATW DoN LAIRCM on conventional Army aircraft and cancel the need for the ATW/CIRCM QRC system for the conventional Army.  (It should be noted that the updated requirement maintains the need for ATW/CIRCM on the Special Operations aircraft.)  As a result, the Army will no longer acquire the ATW sensors for use in Phase 3 of the JUONS effort.  Instead, the Army will accelerate the procurement of the CIRCM QRC systems for use with the currently fielded Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) in preparation for transition to the Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) system when available.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC: Phase 4 LIMWS QRC addressess the HQDA Directed Requirement to provide a greater capability than the current Program of Record (POR), CMWS, to bridge the gap between CMWS and the future POR.

Justification: 
CMWS: FY 2020 Base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) dollars in the amount of $5.785 million will fund development engineering of Threat and Vulnerability Analysis and Systems Engineering Project Management (SEPM). 

Phase 3 CIRCM QRC: FY 2020 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount of $2.220 million will fund System Test &amp; Evaluation (ST&amp;E), technical manual development, and integration efforts to support the Phase 3 Common Infrared Countermeasure Quick Reaction Capability (CIRCM QRC) efforts.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) : FY 2020 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) RDTE dollars in the amount $75.200 million are estimated to fund system testing, design for lead platform, and development of follow-on platform designs.

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>CIRCM QRC (Phase 3) is changing to maximize the Army fleet protection and meet operational requirements.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CMWS: The acquisition strategy includes buying CMWS B-Kits to support fielding requirements and installation of A-Kits on all modernized aircraft. The previous CMWS production contract was a firm fixed-priced (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. A FFP bridge contract was awarded March 2013 for CMWS hardware. The follow-on CMWS production FFP/Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) IDIQ contract is a 3 year firm fixed price contract to procure the remaining Generation 3 Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and A-Kits and was awarded SEP 2013. The Gen 3 ECU, which provides increased processing capacity and enables unguided munitions detection, became a part of the system in FY 2010; First Unit Equipped (FUE) for the Gen 3 ECU was achieved in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) on 18 September 2013. All aircraft deployed to OEF have received the new processor with hostile fire detection capability. Gen 3 ECUs will gradually replace all Gen 2 ECUs across the Aviation fleet between now and 2018.

Phase 2a JUONS DoN LAIRCM and  Phase 3 CIRCM QRC: JUONS S0-0010 acquisition strategy includes aircraft prime contractor engineering support contracted to a Government test organization. Aircraft integration for JUONS will be handled through government operated organizations and industry partners.

Phase 4 Limited Interim Missile Warning System (LIMWS) QRC: Acquisition strategy includes a full and open competition for selection of prime vendor for development of B-Kit and development of A-Kit and support testing for the lead program. Additional platform A-Kit development will be handled by government organizations and industry partners.

Threat and Vulnerability Analysis combines the same efforts as Vulnerability Analysis and Assessment of Technologies (VAAT) and Threat Analysis Database (TAD).

Future Sensor Algorithm Analysis is critically important because this line support the entire Missile Warning Portfolio.  Funds supporting future sensor algorithm analysis and development equally supports MANPADS and Hostile Fire overmatch for the entire Missile Warning Portfolio.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Expanded Mission Area Missile (EMAM) program funding realigned from BA4, PE 0604319A/DU3 to BA5, PE 0605052A/EY7 beginning in FY 2020 in support of enduring IFPC capability.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats. The IFPC Inc 2 system consists of a launcher, integrated fire control, sensor, and an interceptor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission.  The Objective counter-RAM mission employs both alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. 

In FY 2018, the Army evaluated alternative strategies to address an Army interim CM defense (CMD) capability at critical strategic fixed site locations while continuing the development of an enduring capability.  As reported on 31 Oct 2018 the Army intends to field two interim IFPC batteries of Iron Dome in FY 2020, while concurrently componentizing a launcher and interceptor solutions that are interoperable and integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture, IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS), and the Sentinel sensor by FY 2023. For each of the interim capability's Iron Dome Batteries, the Army intends to employ a configuration that matches the Israeli Firing Unit. Prior to making a final decision on the enduring solution, the Army plans to conduct experimentation and analysis with Army sensors and IBCS to determine the complexity of integration of the componentized launcher and interceptor solution. The final decision point, planned for 2QFY2020, will decide between a componentized Iron Dome launcher or a CMD launcher from industry for the enduring IFPC Inc 2 capability. 

This budget request assumes approval of the 2019 Above Threshold Reprogramming request which aligns FY 2018 and FY 2019 funding to the plan provided in the IFPC Acquisition Strategy Report submitted to Congress.

FY 2020 Base dollars in the amount of $243.228 million are designated for the integration and testing of the interim IFPC capability ($74.645 million) and supporting development and integration of the componentized enduring IFPC Inc 2 system ($168.583 million).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats. The IFPC Inc 2 system consists of a launcher, integrated fire control, sensor, and an interceptor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission.  The Objective counter-RAM mission employs both alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. 

In FY 2018, the Army evaluated alternative strategies to address an Army interim CM defense (CMD) capability at critical strategic fixed site locations while continuing the development of an enduring capability.  As reported on 31 Oct 2018 the Army intends to field two interim IFPC batteries of Iron Dome in FY 2020, while concurrently componentizing a launcher and interceptor solutions that are interoperable and integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture, IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS), and the Sentinel sensor by FY 2023. For each of the interim capability's Iron Dome Batteries, the Army intends to employ a configuration that matches the Israeli Firing Unit. Prior to making a final decision on the enduring solution, the Army plans to conduct experimentation and analysis with Army sensors and IBCS to determine the complexity of integration of the componentized launcher and interceptor solution. The final decision point, planned for 2QFY2020, will decide between a componentized Iron Dome launcher or a CMD launcher from industry for the enduring IFPC Inc 2 capability. 

This budget request assumes approval of the 2019 Above Threshold Reprogramming request which aligns FY 2018 and FY 2019 funding to the plan provided in the IFPC Acquisition Strategy Report submitted to Congress.

FY 2020 Base dollars in the amount of $243.228 million are designated for the integration and testing of the interim IFPC capability ($74.645 million) and supporting development and integration of the componentized enduring IFPC Inc 2 system ($168.583 million).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>As reported on 31 Oct 2018 the Army intends to rapidly field an interim capability with the Israeli Iron Dome and an enduring capability of a launcher leveraging the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture and IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) as the Fire Control component, US sensor (Sentinel), and the employment of a variety of missiles.  

In support of the Army's intent, a Directed Requirement to initiate procurement of the Israeli Iron Dome Missile System for an Interim IFPC CMD capability is being staffed for approval and IFPC has requested Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR) actions to align funding in accordance with the Report to Congress.  The ATR requested to repurpose $27.500 million FY 2018 funds and $91.963 million in FY 2019 funds from PE 0605052A/EY7 for Iron Dome experimentation and $36.000 million in FY 2018 procurement funds from PE 0604319A MIPA to procure 240 Tamir (Iron Dome) missiles.  The ATR requested $31.286 million of FY 2019 PE 0604319A MIPA Advanced Procurement (originally for launcher long-lead items) and $20.900 million from PE 0605052A/EY7 to be realigned to IFPC's PE 0604319A MIPA funding line, along with the current $145.636 million from PE 0604319A MIPA to procure two interim Iron Dome batteries for assessment of operational utility under 10 U.S. code, paragraph 2373 (Procurement for Experimental Purposes).  This budget request and Acquisition Strategy assumes approval of the 2019 ATR request which aligns FY 2018 and FY 2019 funding to the plan provided in the IFPC Acquisition Strategy Report submitted to Congress.

In support of the Interim IFPC solution in 2QFY2019, the Army is planning a 10 U.S. code, paragraph 2373 procurement contract to buy 2 Iron Dome batteries for technical evaluation, assessment of operational utility, and safety evaluation.  Aligned with this procurement in FY 2019, IFPC will conduct Modeling and Simulation activities and integrating the hardware and software of the US communications suite with the Iron Dome systems.  Additionally, IFPC will perform logistics analysis and assessments to determine Iron Dome training requirements, fielding requirement, spares packages, maintenance policies, and required Operational and Maintenance documentation.  In FY 2020, IFPC will continue its logistics assessments, Modeling and Simulation analysis, and integration activities, as well as conduct Safety Testing, Performance Analysis and Testing, and Capabilities and Limitations Testing of the Interim IFPC solution at White Sands Missile Range prior to their deployment for operational assessment. 

In support of the Enduring IFPC solution, the Army is participating in multiple experiments and demonstrations of the Iron Dome system in the near future. The first is an experiment/demonstration to integrate the Iron Dome launcher and Tamir interceptor with U.S. sensors and networks. The second is an effort to assess the potential of integrating a CMD launcher from industry with the Tamir interceptor, Sentinel radar, and IBCS. In both instances, the U.S. Government is utilizing the Department of Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) process. IFPC has requested proposals for technology assessments that align with Iron Dome experimentation/demonstration. Information gained through these efforts will inform the Army's enduring IFPC solution decision as reported in the Army's IFPC Acquisition Strategy Report to Congress, submitted on 31 October 2018.  The Army plans the above experimentation and analysis to determine the complexity of integration of the componentized launcher and interceptor solution prior to making a final decision on the Enduring IFPC solution.  The final decision point, planned for 2QFY2020, will decide between a componentized Iron Dome launcher or a CMD launcher from industry for the enduring IFPC Inc 2 capability.

The Army verified technology readiness of missile alternatives in FY 2018 and will select one or more missiles to proceed in FY 2019. The Army will continue missile development, integration, and test to support Enduring IFPC Inc 2 Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation in FY 2023.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element supports modernization of the current Ground Robotic fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Robotic Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.

FB2: The Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) Inc. II is the Army's Soldier transportable, remotely operated, medium size (&lt;= 164 lbs.) common robotic system. The system utilizes both radio and tethered communications allowing dismounted Soldiers to perform hazardous missions from a safe standoff distance. The MTRS Inc. II system consists of an operator control unit (OCU), a suite of various mission payloads, and a mobility platform. Open architecture and the Ground Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) Interoperability Profile (IOP) requirements are employed to reduce obsolescence risks and to maximize efficiency in acquiring future capabilities. MTRS Inc. II will support current and future payload missions for the Engineer's route clearance platoons, Special Operational Forces (SOF) detachments, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Units.

FY 2020 RDTE funds in the amount of $4.646 million will enable the MTRS Inc. II program to progress through Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and into Full Rate Production (FRP). Major FY 2020 activities planned include: Delta Production Qualification Testing asset modifications, test support, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) (i.e. Payload development, Universal Robotic Controller (URC), etc.), logistic product development, logistic product demonstration and verification, provisioning, development of final Multimedia (TM), and Virtual Clearance Training Suite (VCTS) integration.

FB3: Robotic Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts. It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interfaces, common software and common architecture for robotics &amp; autonomous platforms, payloads &amp; universal controllers. It will establish a Common Specifications Reference (CSR) to provide a repository codifying the Army Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) standards for open architecture, interoperability interfaces, and common control. RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET), Tactical Wheeled Vehicle-Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System Type I (RCIS Type I), Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Inc. II, Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), Robotic Combat (RCV), etc.), new standards addressing emerging requirements and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) (i.e. Cyber Security, new autonomous behaviors &amp; artificial intelligence, new payloads, lethality, etc.). 

FY 2020 RDTE funds in the amount of $2.876 million supports the initial scoping &amp; development of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Ground (RAS-G) Interoperability Profile (IOP) Version 5.0. IOP V5.0 will provide the required modular open interfaces and compliance test tools for new programs including SMET Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), LRR, TWV-LF, OMFV, RCV and ERP. Additionally, FY 2020 RDTE funds will support the development &amp; hardening of Robotic Operating System, Military (ROS-M) software modules and ROS-M instantiation documents, and management of ROS-M registry &amp; repository infrastructure.

FB4: The Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) is the Army's small sized (&lt;25 lbs.) Soldier back-packable, remotely operated, common robotic system. The system provides dismounted Soldiers with increased standoff capability from hazardous threats. The system consists of a Universal Robotic Controller (URC), a suite of various payloads, and an open architecture common mobility platform allowing for future capability growth. The CRS(I) will allow the operator to quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and/or payloads. The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces. This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated Warfighting Force by providing standoff to the Warfighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations. 

FY 2020 RDTE funding in the amount of $7.796 million will complete execution of Production Qualification Test (PQT) activities in accordance with approved Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). This funding will also fund design updates from test, software updates, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), payload development, the development and verification of Operator Technical Manuals (TM), LOG Demo, development of training packages, execution of a Limited User Test (LUT) to support Conditional Materiel Release in 2QFY20, potential delta follow-on testing on unmet CDD thresholds, begin development of Maintainer Technical Manuals and other LOG products needed for Full Materiel Release (FMR) in 4QFY21. This funding also supports programmatic risk mitigation activities including, but not limited to: Cyber Security Controls (i.e. Risk Management Framework), commonality directives, payloads, sensors, condition based maintenance, electronics, standard interfaces and architectures, autonomous operations, and other emerging technologies, interoperability (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems assigned at Battalion and below in addition to any program management support costs associated with these activities.

FB6: Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) will help to reduce Soldier loads by transporting mission specific equipment, resupply equipment, and supplies required for extended operations. The SMET will be capable of carrying the equipment currently required to support Infantry and Engineer Platoons in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) for a 72 hour mission without resupply. The SMET will reduce Soldier load, increase squad mobility during combat operations and dismounted maneuvers. SMET will have open architectures, a remote control, support casualty evacuation, power generation/offload and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP).

FY 2020 RDTE funding in the amount of $17.804 million supports the development integration of Technical Insertions and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) to increase mission capabilities for Army wide stakeholders to include MEDCOM, MCOE, MSCOE, and CBRNE to meet requirements in the CDD. FY 2020 RDTE funding supports Developmental testing at Aberdeen and other remaining testing required for the Program of Record to include cyber testing and air drop certification. Program support to include salaries, travel and miscellaneous expense for the SMET program will also be funded.

FB7: The Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a "buy/lease, try and inform" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.

The REP program does not have any FY 2020 RDTE funding.

FB8:  The Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. 

In FY20, this project and funding will transition to PE: 06044827A / Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val project 0604827A.FK4.

FB9: The MTRS Standardization project provides the platforms to support integration and testing of payloads and technology for non-standard unmanned ground robotics systems used by Army Engineers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and Special Operational Forces (SOF) units. Current system characteristics include the following: a remote controlled articulated arm with a gripper, operating range up to 800 meters, multiple illuminated cameras, a pan/tilt surveillance camera, two-way radio, and a ruggedized operator control unit. The platforms provided will support development and testing of the following capabilities: High Dexterous Manipulation System (HDMS), Multi-Spectral Image Fusion System (MIFS), and Precision Aimed Multi-shot Disruptor (PAMD). The use of robotics allows the first approach, to potentially explosive hazards, to be made by a robot rather than a Soldier.  

The Common Robotic System, Heavy (CRS(H)) is a modular large-sized system that provides enhanced protection to the EOD Soldier in order to support the Joint Force Commander with the ability to identify, render safe and dispose of explosive ordnance (EO) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of the Range of Military Operations (ROMO) and Home Land Defense (HLD) operations. CRS(H) will also enable EOD Soldiers to execute Defense Support of the Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations in response to requests from federal, state, local, and tribal authorities for domestic incidents, emergencies, disasters, designated law enforcement support and other activities. CRS(H) will support current and future missions for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.

FY 2020 RDTE funds in the amount of $7.000 million will enable the CRS(H) program to complete the following: System Engineering, Program Management, design and test support, refurbishment of test assets from Fly-off #2, development, integration and testing of system-enhancing payloads (eg: dual arm manipulation, autonomy, mapping, etc.), contract data procurement, travel, and other expenses related to the CRS(H) RDTE program. 

FG8: The Universal Robotic Controller (URC) provides the capability to individually and/or concurrently control multiple Unmanned Systems (UxS) platforms and control/monitor a mesh network without having to obtain and/or carry separate Operator Control Unit (OCUs) for each system. A controlled UxS may be mobile or stationary, can be smart learning, and self-adaptive. Two URCs will be used to hand-off control of a system to a receiver, reducing hand-off time and the need for the UxSs to have multiple OCUs. The URC will also be capable of "hot swapping" batteries where one of its two batteries can be replaced without the system being shut down, halting mission progress, and use current or new Soldier power sources that will maximize its operational time and minimize the number of replacement batteries needed for most missions. The intent of this requirement is allow the Soldier at battalion and below to use the URC to operate unmanned aerial systems (e.g. Raven, PUMA, Short Range Micro (SRM), etc.) and unmanned ground vehicles (e.g. CRS(I), CRS(V),CRS(H), SMET, MTRS INC II, Light Reconnaissance (LR), Wingman, etc.) and emerging unmanned air/ground systems. The URC is defined in the Common Robotic System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Capability Development Document (CDD) and is included in the CRS(I) acquisition. A standalone requirements document is being developed at a date TBD.

FY 2020 RDTE funding in the amount of $1.186 million will be utilized to complete test evaluation and Log product development under the CRS(I) contract, mature the Universal Robotic Controller to meet the requirements in the CDD and emerging programs of record, controller software updates, and integration and test the URC into other Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAS) programs of record via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP). This funding also supports programmatic risk mitigation activities including, but not limited to: Cyber Security Controls (i.e. Risk Management Framework), commonality directives, payloads, sensors, condition based maintenance, electronics, standard interfaces and architectures, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies, interoperability (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems assigned at Battalion and below in addition to any program management support costs associated with these activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) Inc. II is the Army's Soldier transportable, remotely operated, medium size (&lt;= 164 lbs.) common robotic system. The system utilizes both radio and tethered communications allowing dismounted Soldiers to perform hazardous missions from a safe standoff distance. The MTRS Inc. II system consists of an operator control unit (OCU), a suite of various mission payloads, and a mobility platform. Open architecture and the Ground Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) Interoperability Profile (IOP) requirements are employed to reduce obsolescence risks and to maximize efficiency in acquiring future capabilities. MTRS Inc. II will support current and future payload missions for the Engineer's route clearance platoons, Special Operational Forces (SOF) detachments, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Units.

FY 2020 RDTE funds will enable the MTRS Inc. II program to progress through Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and into Full Rate Production (FRP). Major FY 2020 activities planned include: Delta Production Qualification Testing asset modifications, test support, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) (i.e. Payload development, Universal Robotic Controller, etc.), logistic product development, logistic product demonstration and verification, provisioning, development of final Multimedia (TM), and Virtual Clearance Training Suite (VCTS) integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Robotic Architecture (RA) provides the engineering and development resources to manage the overarching architecture for robotic systems that are both modular and interoperable across the Joint Force in order to facilitate future modernization efforts. It will manage the interoperability standards, modular payload interfaces, common software and common architecture for robotics &amp; autonomous platforms, payloads &amp; universal controllers. It will establish a Common Specifications Reference (CSR) to provide a repository codifying the Army Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) standards for open architecture, interoperability interfaces, and common control. RA includes the construction of program specific Interoperability Profiles (IOP) (i.e. Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET), Tactical Wheeled Vehicle-Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Route Clearance Interrogation System Type I (RCIS Type I), Common Robotics System (Vehicle) (CRS(V)), Common Robotics System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Inc. II, Common Robotics System (Heavy) (CRS(H)), Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP), Light Reconnaissance Robot (LRR), Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), Robotic Combat (RCV), etc.), new standards addressing emerging requirements and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) (i.e. Cyber Security, new autonomous behaviors &amp; artificial intelligence, new payloads, lethality, etc.). 

FY 2020 RDTE funds in the amount of $1.792 million support the initial scoping &amp; development of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Ground (RAS-G) Interoperability Profile (IOP) Version 5.0. IOP V5.0 will provide the required modular open interfaces and compliance test tools for new programs including SMET Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), LRR, TWV-LF, OMFV, RCV and ERP. Additionally, FY 2020 RDTE funds will support the development &amp; hardening of Robotic Operating System, Military (ROS-M) software modules and ROS-M instantiation documents, and management of ROS-M registry &amp; repository infrastructure.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I)) is the Army's small sized (&lt;25 lbs.) Soldier back-packable, remotely operated, common robotic system. The system provides dismounted Soldiers with increased standoff capability from hazardous threats. The system consists of a Universal Robotic Controller (URC), a suite of various payloads, and an open architecture common mobility platform allowing for future capability growth. The CRS(I) will allow the operator to quickly re-configure for other various missions by adding or removing modules and/or payloads. The CRS(I) will provide interrogation, detection, confirmation, and neutralization capabilities employed to support a wide spectrum of mobility missions for current and future forces. This capability provides commanders the ability to persistently monitor the Operating Environment (OE) while protecting and sustaining the force. The CRS(I) complements the Joint Integrated War-fighting Force by providing standoff to the Warfighter during major combat, stability, and homeland security operations. 

FY 2020 RDTE funding in the amount of $7.796 million will complete execution of Production Qualification Test (PQT) activities in accordance with approved Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). This funding will also fund design updates from test, software updates, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), payload development, the development and verification of Operator Technical Manuals (TM), LOG Demo, development of training packages, execution of a Limited User Test (LUT) to support Conditional Materiel Release in 2QFY20, potential delta follow-on testing on unmet CDD thresholds, begin development of Maintainer Technical Manuals and other LOG products needed for Full Materiel Release (FMR) in 4QFY21. This funding also supports programmatic risk mitigation activities including, but not limited to: Cyber Security Controls (i.e. Risk Management Framework), commonality directives, payloads, sensors, condition based maintenance, electronics, standard interfaces and architectures, autonomous operations, and other emerging technologies, interoperability (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems assigned at Battalion and below in addition to any program management support costs associated with these activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) will help to reduce Soldier loads by transporting mission specific equipment, resupply equipment, and supplies required for extended operations. The SMET will be capable of carrying the equipment currently required to support Infantry and Engineer Platoons in the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) for a 72 hour mission without resupply. The SMET will reduce Soldier load, increase squad mobility during combat operations and dismounted maneuvers.  SMET will have open architectures, a remote control and support casualty evacuation, power generation/offload and reintegration of Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) and technical insertions.

FY 2020 RDTE funding supports the development integration and purchase of Technical Insertions and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP) to increase mission capabilities to meet objective requirements in the CDD. FY 2020 RDTE funding supports Developmental testing at Aberdeen and other remaining testing required for the Program of Record to include cyber testing and air drop certification. Program support to include salaries, travel and miscellaneous expense for the SMET program will also be funded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) Assessment effort was completed as part of the Robotics Development effort under the Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (654641DV7) funding line in FY2017. This Phase I Assessment supported a rapid start to establish an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) Acquisition Strategy supporting the Directed Requirement, signed 14 April 2017. The OTA began with a Request For Project Proposal (RPP), followed by an evaluation and down select to 10 vendors in FY17 as part of the Robotic Enhancement Program under the Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (654641DV7) funding line. In FY18 a down select from 10 to 4 vendors decided which platforms would participate in the OTA Phase II 12 month Technology Demonstration, 20 systems were purchased from each of the 4 vendors issued to IBCTs. This Technology Demonstration will guide the development of the Capability Development Document (CDD) leading to a Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) decision in 3QFY19. 

Following the OTA Phase II Technology Demonstration, a source selection will occur to award a Program of Record (POR) contract(s) for LRIP and production to the system that best meets the Army's needs. Project Manager Force Projection (PM FP) is requesting authority from the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) to pursue a Rapid Fielding pathway under Section 804 Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) in accordance with Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to meet Chief of Staff of the Army guidance to provide the Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) capability to Soldiers by 2QFY20. Under an approved Section 804 Rapid Fielding pathway, the PM will down select to one or more of the four prototypes and award refurbishment of Phase II systems, LRIP, FRP, LOG development and System Technical Support under the Phase III Production OTA.

It is the Army's intent to maximize the use of an Open Systems Architecture (OSA), as well as the approved Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) interoperability profiles (IOP) for SMET. The PdM plans to gather sufficient data during the SMET Technology Demonstration to reduce development efforts and provide cost savings by incorporating the developed SMET technology to include future technical insertions and Modular Mission Payloads (MMP)  into the Program of Record. Throughout the life of the program, the Army will continue to survey the marketplace to identify opportunities for technology insertions and required Modular Mission Payloads (MMP), relying on competition to drive down costs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Robotics Enhanced Program (REP) uses a "buy/lease, try and inform" methodology to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.

This program has no FY 2020 Base or OCO RDTE funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) is a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The SBS provides a near term solution to three Army War-fighting Challenges at the Infantry Squad level: develop situational understanding, conduct air-ground reconnaissance, and conduct joint combined arms maneuver. The system is simple to deploy and use to support the squad leader's decision-making process. The system allows Soldiers to obtain local situational awareness and understanding of their immediate surroundings while remaining in covered or concealed positions.  Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. 

In FY20, this project and funding will transition to PE: 0604827A / Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem/Val, Project FK4.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Common Robotic System, Heavy (CRS(H)) is a modular large-sized system that provides enhanced protection to the EOD Soldier in order to support the Joint Force Commander with the ability to identify, render safe and dispose of explosive ordnance (EO) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of the Range of Military Operations (ROMO) and Home Land Defense (HLD) operations. CRS(H) will also enable EOD Soldiers to execute Defense Support of the Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations in response to requests from federal, state, local, and tribal authorities for domestic incidents, emergencies, disasters, designated law enforcement support and other activities. CRS(H) will support current and future missions for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.

FY 2020 RDTE funds in the amount of $7.000 million will enable the CRS(H) program to complete the following: System Engineering, Program Management, design and test support, refurbishment of test assets from Fly-off #2, development, integration and testing of system-enhancing payloads (eg: dual arm manipulation, autonomy, mapping, etc.), contract data procurement, travel, and other expenses related to the CRS(H) RDTE program.

NOTE: $4.618 million of FY 2019 CRS(H) RDTE funds 655053FB9 Ground Robotics, MTRS Standardization, were reprogrammed to the FY 2019 CRS(H) OPA line W12001A EOD Robotics Systems Recapitalization during the Congressional enactment process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Universal Robotic Controller (URC) provides the capability to individually and/or concurrently control multiple Unmanned Systems (UxS) platforms and control/monitor a mesh network without having to obtain and/or carry separate Operator Control Unit (OCUs) for each system. A controlled UxS may be mobile or stationary, can be smart learning, and self-adaptive. Two URCs will be used to hand-off control of a system to a receiver, reducing hand-off time and the need for the UxSs to have multiple OCUs. The URC will also be capable of "hot swapping" batteries where one of its two batteries can be replaced without the system being shut down, halting mission progress, and use current or new Soldier power sources that will maximize its operational time and minimize the number of replacement batteries needed for most missions. The intent of this requirement is allow the Soldier at battalion and below to use the URC to operate unmanned aerial systems (e.g. Raven, PUMA, Short Range Micro (SRM), etc.) and unmanned ground vehicles (e.g. CRS(I), CRS(V),CRS(H), SMET, MTRS INC II, Light Reconnaissance (LR), Wingman, etc.) and emerging unmanned air/ground systems. The URC is defined in the Common Robotic System (Individual) (CRS(I)) Capability Development Document (CDD) and is included in the CRS(I) acquisition. A standalone requirements document is being developed at a date TBD.

FY 2020 RDTE funding in the amount of $1.186 million will be utilized to complete test evaluation and LOG product development under the CRS(I) contract, mature the Universal Robotic Controller to meet the requirements in the CDD and emerging programs of record, controller software updates, and integration and test the URC into other Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAS) programs of record via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP). This funding also supports programmatic risk mitigation activities including, but not limited to: Cyber Security Controls (i.e. Risk Management Framework), commonality directives, payloads, sensors, condition based maintenance, electronics, standard interfaces and architectures, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies, interoperability (IOP), and analysis of collaborative operations with various Unmanned Systems assigned at Battalion and below in addition to any program management support costs associated with these activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The controller will also use haptic indicators inside the hand grips to give the user active feedback of the controlled system's movements if the UxS software is programmed to use them. If and when the use of lethal systems on the URC is approved, the weaponized payloads will be controlled via several fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced Soldier, ground, aviation, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence &amp; Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and equipment. The Primary goal is to take technologies to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 and 8 through a collaborative and accelerated acquisition process. Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability in the immediate, near- and mid-terms. Efforts will include accelerated material development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Cyber; Electronic Warfare (EW); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Counter UAV (C-UAV); Communications; Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Survivability; Long Range Precision Fires and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. Funding may also be used to acquire specialized expertise to execute an initiative.

The Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders' needs. The RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally.  Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.

The RCO capabilities focus areas are: Cyber Electronic Warfare (EW), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Counter UAV (C-UAV), Communications, Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Survivability, and Long Range Precisions Fires Directed Requirements (DR) and Operational Needs Statements (ONS). In addition, any other operational needs that become a priority as designated by the Army Rapid Capabilities Office Board of Directors (BOD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army RCO capitalizes on current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to address emerging threats and high impact capability opportunities of U.S. Army Forces deployed globally. This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The Rapid Capabilities Office will have a dedicated contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches.  To reach non-traditional vendors, RCO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority instruments. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment. Operational assessments will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, and future capability development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army System Development &amp; Demonstration budget line includes multiple efforts across the Army's Battlefield Operational Systems necessary to support projects in engineering and manufacturing development for use on programs that have not received approval for full-rate. System performance is near or at planned operational system levels.  

Projects are characterized by mature system development, integration, demonstration to support Milestone C decisions, conducting live fire test and evaluation, and initial operational test and evaluation of production representative articles.

Selected programs within this budget line will exhibit a logical progression of program phases, development and production funding within the FYDP, consistent with the Department's full funding policy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AMF radios are software programmable, multi-band, multi-mode, mobile ad hoc networking radios, providing simultaneous voice and data communications for Army Aviation platforms.  The radios will operate in networks supporting the Common Operating Picture, Situational Awareness, and interoperability of Mission Command systems throughout the battlefield.  AMF radios will ensure the Soldier's ability to communicate both horizontally and vertically via voice and data within all mission areas and Common Operating Environment.  AMF radios will operate waveforms that are deployed by Joint Forces today, and will introduce networking waveforms to the Aviation community that will enable interoperability between air and ground forces and transport operational and Mission Command information through the tactical network.  AMF radios will help close capability gaps by extending data networking to company and below echelons, enabling network services to the platform and connecting Army Aviation platforms to Army ground and Joint air network domains. 

On 17 July 18, the Army Acquisition Executive signed both the SANR Closeout Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and SANR Termination plan.  This ADM and plan initiates a program termination action and directs an orderly shutdown of the SANR program. 

The SANR subprogram (Project EG6) has no approved requirement and all funding has been withdrawn in FY 2020 and beyond.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to FY 2014, the Airborne Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) was funded under Navy PE 0604280N, aligned under the Navy JTRS Programs. In accordance with a July 11, 2012 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), the JTRS Program of Record transitioned to a Military Department-managed program. AMF is now managed by Program Executive Office Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, under Project Manager Tactical Radios, and funded by Army PE 0605380A. On May 2, 2014, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, issued an ADM that designated Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) and Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) as subprograms under the AMF Program. In FY 2015, Project EA9 represented the total Airborne Maritime Fixed Small Airborne (AMF-SA, or SALT) RDT&amp;E budget. In FY 2016, funding was allocated between the SALT (Project EA9) and SANR (Project EG6) subprograms.  The SANR subprogram (Project EG6) has no approved requirement and funding has been withdrawn in FY 2020 and beyond.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Per MDA direction, AMF JTRS will procure SANR radios as Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  The SANR is a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency Type 1 certified networking radio providing seamless real-time information for operation in mobile and dynamic combat environments that will meet tactical communications requirements as validated by the Army Aviation community.  SANR will provide increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms via advanced networking capabilities supporting Mid-Tier and Lower Tier tactical networks, and maintain Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capability.  SANR will replace the current SINCGARS radios on Army Aviation platforms.  SANR is planned for implementation on the following platforms: Apache (AH-64E), Black Hawk (UH-60V, UH-60M, HH-60M, and MH-60M), Chinook (CH-47F and MH-47G), and Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (MQ-1C) aircraft.  SANR will enhance and further enable the ability of the maneuver commander to integrate and synchronize aviation forces with land based operational forces. SANR, employed on Army aviation platforms, will enable aviation combat elements (Combat Aviation Brigades, Theater Aviation Brigades, and Special Operations Aviation Regiment) to better utilize the inherent versatility of airborne communications as a complement to the unique capabilities of the other combat arms.  SANR will give commanders enhanced Situational Awareness and Mission Command in a package that provides a more responsive means of directing aircraft to match changing maneuver forces situations and missions.

On 17 July 18, the Army Acquisition Executive signed both the SANR Closeout Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and SANR Termination plan.  This ADM and plan initiates a program termination action and directs an orderly shutdown of the SANR program.

Advance Procurement of long lead items (HELLFIRE Romeo back-ends and Guidance Section subsystems) occurred in FY 2016 - FY 2017.  The long lead procurement was needed to facilitate Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) I which was necessary to achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and LRIP II.  MS C was approved on 15 Jun 2018 and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) is scheduled for the 3rd quarter of FY 2019.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) program is a designated Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).

The AIAMD program is a direct response to the U.S. Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Concept and Operational and Organizational (O&amp;O) Plan for the Future Force, the AIAMD System of Systems (SoS) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the AMD Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS). The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching SoS capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability, (2) the Integrated Fire Control Relay capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations, and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components, weapon components, and the IBCS EOC.

The AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric SoS capability (also referred to as "Plug and Fight") that integrates AMD sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC. The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements, to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats, providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully. Further, it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD design in the past. The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single IBCS that will result in overall training savings. The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will interface with the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN), alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. 

AIAMD IOC will be delivered through the fielding of the IBCS-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC, Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) Relay, Sentinel, and Patriot components working in an integrated manner through the IFCN connection. The government controlled open architecture enables integration of future capabilities to meet emerging threats and fielding to Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade, Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD).

Funding in FY 2020 supports agile software development, developmental and operational testing, culminating in a Limited User Test (LUT) in fourth quarter FY 2020. These include: completion of IBCS Qualification Testing, Logistics Demonstration, New Equipment Training development, Collective Training development and developmental testing. The LUT supports a Low Rate Initial Production Decision at Milestone C in FY 2020 consisting of both hardware in the loop and live fire events. Software development continues throughout FY 2020 to integrate additional capabilities prior to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY 2022.

AIAMD is a critical component of the Army's Air and Missile Defense strategy, the Chief of Staff of the Army's number five modernization priority.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This program is an integral part of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture.  It provides for development of a common Integrated Fire Control System through an open architecture approach allowing for integration of Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components as they become available. This approach enables the AIAMD program to pursue its baseline program independent of fluctuation of other programs.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AIAMD acquisition strategy is to deliver an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY 2022. The capabilities are delivered through the fielding of the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS Engagement Operations Center (EOC), Sentinel, and Patriot (through a Radar Interface Unit (RIU)) components connected via an Integrated Fire Control Relay, working in an integrated manner. Future capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Indirect Fire Protection Capabilities (IFPC), Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade, Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries, and other Army and Joint net-centric architectures using an agile software development process.

Key principles of the AIAMD acquisition approach are the following:
-  Migrate from system-based acquisition to competitive component-based acquisition using agile development/operations methodology IAW FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act direction
-  Use system-of-systems acquisition approach with collaboration among AIAMD, PEO MS, PEO C3T, and Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization Component Project Offices, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other Service Project Offices to network-enable weapons and sensor components
-  Develop and procure a common Army IBCS EOC that replaces seven weapon system unique Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components
-  Establish product lines used to evaluate and select, modify and integrate modular open systems hardware and software common configuration items
-  Conduct architecture-based System Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&amp;T) activities for an incrementally fielded configuration of the AIAMD Integrated Fire Control Network-compatible IBCS EOC, weapons and sensor system components</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This is a parallel effort continued from PE 0603645A / Armored System Modernization - Adv Dev, project EV7: Combat Vehicle Prototyping.  
This is a new start in FY 2020.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Next Generation Combat Vehicle-Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (NGCV-OMFV) is a purpose built manned platform that maneuvers Soldiers to a point of positional advantage to engage in close combat. It is designed to operate with or without a crew and Soldiers under armor based on the commander's decision. It delivers decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver while also controlling maneuver robotics and semi-autonomous systems. The platform will be optimized for operations in dense urban terrain and with significantly reduced logistical burdens. The vehicle will include an architecture to allow for increased capability and growth margin.

In close combat, the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) will deliver decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver. The changing character of warfare drives changes in how the Army delivers, operates, and sustains future combat capabilities. The Army's first priority is to replace the Bradley with the OMFV. The OMFV will be developed using an incremental approach to the integration of advanced lethality and sensing technologies, with focus of increment one to gain growth margins in power, weight and vehicle computing architecture as the NGCV Cross Functional Team's (CFT) first priority, followed by an Increment II to integrate weapon system, targeting and sensing technologies that are matured and qualified within Science and Technology programs.  OMFV will be joined later by a purpose built Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) and future capability upgrades for the OMFV.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This is a new start in FY 2020.  This program supports the Cross Functional Team (CFT).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Next Generation Combat Vehicle-Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (NGCV-OMFV) is a purpose built manned platform that maneuvers Soldiers to a point of positional advantage to engage in close combat. It is designed to operate with or without a crew and Soldiers under armor based on the commander's decision. It delivers decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver while also controlling maneuver robotics and semi-autonomous systems. The platform will be optimized for operations in dense urban terrain and with significantly reduced logistical burdens. The vehicle will include an architecture to allow for increased capability and growth margin.

In close combat, the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) will deliver decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver. The changing character of warfare drives changes in how the Army delivers, operates, and sustains future combat capabilities. The Army's first priority is to replace the Bradley with the OMFV. The OMFV will be developed using an incremental approach to integration of advanced lethality and sensing technologies, with focus of increment one to gain growth margins in power, weight and vehicle computing architecture as the NGCV Cross Functional Team's (CFT) first priority, followed by an Increment II to integrate weapon system, targeting and sensing technologies that are matured and qualified within Science and Technology programs.  OMFV will be joined later by a purpose built Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) and future capability upgrades for the OMFV.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 'National Integration To Tactical Systems (Military Intelligence Program - MIP)' funds provide for transition and integration of National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced technologies and prototypes leveraged by the Army's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program office. The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2; Army G8; and the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)]; and includes representatives from the Army G3; Army G6; Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on this TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy with Army investments. Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army POR.  Army TENCAP facilitates the continued access to National Intel Community (IC) 'joint' efforts and compatibility with those National standards and software baseline for those Army PORs that benefit from these leveraged National IC technologies, resulting in cost-savings through cost-sharing, and Army participation in collaborative Intelligence. Funds will be used for final-stage integration efforts identified and vetted through the Army TENCAP annual TGOSG, such as: advanced Air Vigilance software enhancements; POR sensor integration into the Theater Net-Centric Geolocation network; integration of the future Advanced Miniaturized Data Acquisition System (AMDAS - Next) capability into PM DCGS-A family of systems and operational concepts;  transition and integration of Army TENCAP technologies discovered and leveraged by the annual Military Exploitation of Reconnaissance and Intelligent Technology (MERIT) project selection process, as well as other transitioning technologies discovered and/or leverage through other joint TENCAP outreach efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Vigilance (AV) is an ACAT III Automated Information System (AIS) program of record (POR) that originated from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developed and fielded cooperatively with the Intelligence Community (IC) through the efforts and mission of the Army's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) office.  The QRC was transitioned into an Army AIS POR by the AAE in May 2013 and assigned to Army Program Executive Office - Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS), the chartered acquisition authority for management and execution of the Army's TENCAP mission and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for the AV POR.  The Army TENCAP continues to leverage the IC common software development and support contract to field the AV systems, and ensure this primarily software based system can continue to access and leverage the common software, and input or ingest the latest sensor collects into the common IC data library.  As an AIS POR, the AV POR is currently fielding systems per its Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) and with software and system capabilities that meet its latest validated Capability Drop (CD) requirements. The AV POR is currently scheduled to meet Full Deployment (FD) by 2021, and will continue to evolve to meet future validated Capability Drop requirements and maintain its effectiveness against emerging threats.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army is the lead service.  The JLTV goal is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles designed to provide protected, sustained, and networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO).  JLTV objectives include increased performance, protection, and payload over the current legacy HMMWV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized. 

Funding supports modernization of the current Tactical Wheeled Vehicle fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.

Major FY20 budget activities include evaluation and assessment to improve reliability, reduce operational and sustainment (O&amp;S) costs, or provide incremental upgrades to the base platform. These include: Li-Ion based technologies and mainstream DoD efforts to optimize the JLTV energy storage system architecture and drastically reduce (O&amp;S) costs; acoustic and thermal signature mitigation technologies; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) system packaging optimization efforts; integration of future weapon systems (i.e. Howitzer M119A3); integration of Ground Base Air Defense (GBAD), assured Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT), Handheld Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) Block 2, Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS); tire solutions that provide more robust sidewalls while also providing optimal tire deflection; and Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulation (TADSS).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army is the lead service.  The JLTV goal is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles designed to provide protected, sustained, and networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO).  JLTV objectives include increased performance, protection, and payload over the current legacy HMMWV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized. 

Funding supports modernization of the current Tactical Wheeled Vehicle fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.

Major FY20 budget activities include evaluation and assessment to improve reliability, reduce operational and sustainment (O&amp;S) costs, or provide incremental upgrades to the base platform. These include: Li-Ion based technologies and mainstream DoD efforts to optimize the JLTV energy storage system architecture and drastically reduce (O&amp;S) costs; acoustic and thermal signature mitigation technologies; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) system packaging optimization efforts; integration of future weapon systems (i.e. Howitzer M119A3); integration of Ground Base Air Defense (GBAD), assured Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT), Handheld Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) Block 2, Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS); tire solutions that provide more robust sidewalls while also providing optimal tire deflection; and Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulation (TADSS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) is a Joint Service Program with the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps as the two main components.  The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead.

The JLTV Program entered the Production and Deployment Phase with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorization on 25 August 2015.  With Milestone C approval, the LRIP fixed price contract was awarded to Oshkosh Defense LLC on 25 August 2015.  This contract consists of a three year LRIP period with options for five additional years of FRP deliveries.  JPO JLTV requested separately priced firm fixed price (FFP) option(s) for purchase of the Technical Data Package (TDP) with appropriate data rights to allow for possible future competition for production vehicles and spares. 

During the LRIP phase, JPO JLTV will continue to produce production vehicles for extensive Test and Evaluation activities to support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision.  A ramp up of JLTV quantities will continue to support fielding to U.S. Army and USMC units once the FRP decision is achieved and allow the program to transition into FRP.

In support of a FRP decision, by the end of March 2019, the Program Manager (PM) is to provide test vehicles to Army Futures Command (AFC) and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) for evaluation of situational awareness optimal solution sets to include larger door windows with and without camera mix.  Improvements for noise reductions both internal and external, to include mufflers, alternator isolation and new design on gears for gear box, trans-axle and wheel ends are desired to be included with soldier feedback assessment with situational awareness.  Additionally, the PM is to provide a cost estimate for troop seats to include automotive style seat belts with integrated roll-over protection.  United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is tasked to review requirements for JLTV trailer to specified type units.  Decision brief on JLTV performance improvements is to be provided to senior leaders no later than May 2019.

The JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with U.S. Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships. The JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the systems Life Cycle.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) is an ACAT 1C Acquisition Program. The program will replace the current fleet of M109 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consisting of the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer and M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV). PIM is an Army Modernization Program that addresses a critical capability gap created by the Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination in June of 2009 as well as obsolescence and Space, Weight,and Power (SWAP) issues in the M109 FoV current fleet. The PIM system integrates current Bradley Fighting Vehicle suspension and drive train items, Future Combat Systems (FCS) developed Electric Gun Drive systems and current fleet (M109A6) fire control systems into a new chassis providing better force protection, survivability and increases in electrical power over the current fleet. PIM is a two vehicle system:  The M109A7 Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and the M992A3 Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT).  The SPH has all characteristics listed above.  The CAT utilizes all of these same components and traits except those related directly to the cannon system. The PIM system replaces the current M109 FoV on a one for one basis, in the cannon fires battalions in the Armored Brigade Combat Team Formations and the Echelons above Brigade (EAB). The overall intent is to increase Soldier force protection, vehicle survivability, provide an appropriate amount of SWAP capacity to add future capabilities, increase vehicle reliability, reduce life cycle costs and extend the life of the M109 FoV through FY 2050.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The PIM Program was initiated on 16 August 2007 under the BAE Systems, Inc., System Technical Support (STS) Contract W56HZV-07-C-0096.  Subsequent work directives were awarded under BAE STS contract W56HZV-07-C-0256 to further define the configuration of the PIM vehicles.  On 14 August 2009, a Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Contract W56HZV-09-C-0550 was awarded to BAE Systems Inc. for the Prototype Development and Fabrication of 7 prototype vehicles (5 PIM Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) Systems and 2 PIM Carrier Ammunition, Tracked (CAT) vehicles).  A Comprehensive Contract Modification (CCM) award to the RDT&amp;E contract was accomplished on 6 January 2012.  This modification allows for the completion of the design engineering and initial developmental test portion of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and transfers the system responsibility for the program from the Government to BAE Systems Inc.   An additional modification to the EMD contract was awarded on 18 July 2014 to extend the contract until 31 March 2017 to cover contractor support to Production Qualification Testing (PQT), the Logistics Demonstration, and Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).  The awarded Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract is of a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contract type for procurement of vehicles with a period of performance running from November 2013 through approximately June 2019.  The LRIP contract will provide for three LRIP years with the initial base year including 19 SPHs and 18 CATs and the remaining three option years with 18 sets, 30 sets and 48 sets, respectively (each set consisting of one each SPH and CAT) of PIM vehicles.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract is planned as a FPIF contract with the option to convert to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract after the first year of FRP.  The FRP contract provides for the remaining PIM vehicles to fulfill the requirement up to the Army Acquisition Objective of 580 sets.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project is a Military Intelligence Program (MIP). TROJAN research and development supports TROJAN Next Generation (TROJAN NexGEN), formerly TROJAN Classic XXI (TCXXI), future capabilities to fulfill the Army's need for worldwide, deployable, remotable, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support that can dynamically execute operations from sanctuary-based to deployed assets in theater. In support of Army Modernization and Army Force Generation, TROJAN NexGEN will provide soldiers with a real-world, hands-on, live and near-real time Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) training environment sustaining, maintaining and enhancing their military occupational specialty proficiencies and specific target expertise. This operational readiness training will fulfill the Army's larger intelligence training requirement via a secure, collaborative architecture. 

A key factor for future force success is the ability to collect, process, and use information about an adversary while preventing similar information from being disclosed. TROJAN NexGEN is a combined operational and readiness mission system which uses advanced networking technology to provide seamless rapid radio relay, secure communications to include voice, data, and electronic reconnaissance support to U.S. forces throughout the world. TROJAN NexGEN operations may be easily tailored to fit military intelligence unit training schedules and surged during specific events to involve every aspect of the tactical intelligence collection, processing, analysis and reporting systems. Engineers test and evaluate new digital intelligence collection, processing and dissemination technology using the fielded TROJAN NexGEN systems prior to the acquisition of those technologies. As part of the objective intelligence architecture, these capabilities will enable processing and dissemination of real-time intelligence data from various sources to form the intelligence needed to issue orders inside the threat decision cycle. To that end, it is imperative that TROJAN NexGEN keeps pace with digitization initiatives in order to respond aggressively to the emerging intelligence communication threat.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical Electronic Warfare (EW) terrestrial (ground) employment applications. The systems under this program provide the Army with the capability to detect, identify, locate, collect/process, report, and engage (disrupt, degrade or deny) hostile forces to prevent their effective use of communications, counter-mortar/counter-battery radars, surveillance radars, and electronically fused munitions.

Project EW5 provides for Prophet Enhanced, the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program. Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade enabling the most effective engagement of enemy forces. Prophet Enhanced provides a modular, scalable, open architecture based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).

Project EW6 provides for the Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT), a Department of the Army established project to develop techniques, methods, tools and architecture to reprogram mission software embedded in Army EW systems, Force Protection Systems (FPS), and Target Sensing Systems (TSS) in response to changes in threat signatures.  ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within intelligence systems, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop EW Mission Software and Products (MSP) for both air and ground EW systems, 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to transmit mission software changes to field users, and 5) enhanced mission-software uploading tools. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, simulation, mission software development, distribution and uploading of mission software changes directly to the supported Soldier in the field.  The ARAT project will develop, test and equip an Army-wide infrastructure capable of rapidly reprogramming electronic combat software embedded in offensive and defensive weapon systems.

Project FJ5 provides for Terrestrial Layer System (TLS), a new start effort that initiates in FY 2020 and has the first year of funding in this Program Element in FY2021 to address a Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Cyber-enabling integrated solution to support Multi Domain Battle capability gaps and provide Force Protection, Situational Development, and Information Superiority to the maneuver forces.

Fiscal Year 2020 funds Electronic Warfare (EW) Development for Prophet Enhanced efforts (Project EW5) and the Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) efforts (Project EW6).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) is a Department of the Army established program to develop techniques, methods, tools, and architecture to rapidly reprogram mission software embedded in Army Electronic Warfare (EW) Force Protection Systems (FPS) in response to changes in threat signatures. The regulatory guidance directing this mission is contained in Army Regulation (AR) 525-15, AR 525-22, and AR 95-1. The ARAT develops integrated technical solutions required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW Signal threats to US Forces. The ARAT mission software reprogramming infrastructure supports the Army Campaign Plan to provide the Regionally Aligned Forces tactical Commander timely rapid-reprogramming capability of EW systems with mission software.  The ARAT mission responsibility is to develop and distribute Mission Software and Products to forward deployed combat forces. ARAT identifies and analyzes worldwide threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determines the impact of observed Signal Intelligence (SIGINT)  signature changes; rapidly develops new mission software to adapt friendly systems to detect and defeat enemy threats to U.S. Army ground and air platforms; disseminates the Mission Software and Products to forward deployed forces, and provides government developed tools and software to upload new mission software into the affected EW systems.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Current military operations are conducted in a rapidly changing threat environment, where Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Infra Red (IR) man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) seekers, radar guided surface-to-air-missiles (SAM), laser guided weapons, anti-helicopter mines, and targeting sensors are proliferating and evolving. Integrated solutions are required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW threats.  The ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the tactical Commander by providing timely rapid reprogramming of mission software and information dissemination for Army supported, Joint and allied services.  ARAT supports integrated reprogramming of target acquisition, target engagement, vehicle survivability, and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE). ARAT rapid-reprogramming infrastructure supports tactical requirements for deployed aircraft and ground-based (e.g. Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (CREW)) survivability systems. ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect EW systems; determines the impact of observed signature changes; develops new mission software to adapt the system to the changes; disseminates the mission software; and provides methods to upload the new mission software into the affected EW systems. Each element within the ARAT infrastructure plays a specific role within the program's rapid reprogramming process, providing the Soldier with the capability to install mission and target identification software at the lowest possible level, thus maximizing flexibility for tactical commanders. ARAT participates in the operational and developmental test design of Army EW systems, and supports Joint Service Reprogramming Exercises in all theaters. ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within the intelligence system, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop Mission Software and Products (MSP), 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MSPs, 4) improved communications conduits to rapidly transmit mission software to upload into supported EW systems. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, threat modeling and simulation, mission software development and testing, distribution and uploading of mission software directly to the supported Soldier in the field.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>ARAT had several FY 2018 accomplishments.  

ARAT completed Phase 1 of the Ground Electronic Warfare (GrEW) Automated Test Set (ATS). The GrEW ATS replicates complex open air Radio Frequency (RF) environments in the laboratory allowing rapid, fully automated testing of EW system loads with actual hardware in the loop, reducing software development timelines, providing higher-fidelity software testing, and lowering sustainment costs by reducing or eliminating field testing for GrEW systems.  The GrEW ATS is in operation in the ARAT laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  The GrEW ATS is scalable to insert capability to replicate future threat systems as well as physical and climatic environments utilizing modelling and simulation to predict RF propagation.  The GrEW system became operational in early FY17 and has reduced engineering timelines from 6 weeks to 2 weeks. 

ARAT completed the ARAT Display Emulator. ARAT designed and developed an ARAT Display Emulator IP-1150A Multispectral Warning Cockpit Display.  The IP-1150A is a legacy analog display still utilized on the UH-60A/L Blackhawk and the CH-47C/D Chinook aircrafts.  This follow-on project leverages the previous Display Emulator that concentrated on Army aircraft with glass cockpit digital technology.  The Display Emulator replicates multiple aircraft displays on COTS computers executing precise emulation of all ASE symbology without the need for actual aircraft hardware.  This capability allows testers to monitor multiple devices during the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) process.  The Display Emulator technology reduces time for testing of mission software by providing visualization of symbology that previously required a manual lookup table for engineering validation.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>ARAT completed the Knee Board Card Generator (KBCG).   ARAT designed and developed a KBCG software tool.  Kneeboard cards, utilized in the aircraft cockpit, allow combat Aviators to quickly determine the lethality of the threat system engaging the aircraft and the appropriate countermeasures needed to defeat the threat.  The KBCG automates the process of converting threat data information to Kneeboard Cards. The KBCG can support multiple Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) radar warning receivers on Army aircraft and serves as the primary means of displaying cockpit symbology. This automated process reduces production time from several days to a few minutes and allows for customization prior to final publication.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>ARAT completed the Automated Testing for AN/APR 39D(V)2 Mission Software.  ARAT designed and delivered a Radio Frequency (RF) automated mission software test capability for the Army?s newest Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), the AN/APR 39D(V)2 system.  Prior to developing this capability, testing of mission software was conducted in a manual test process that took months to complete.  The development of this automated testing capability optimizes the Army?s ability to rapidly develop and test mission software for this modernized RWR, initially fielded on the AH-64A Apache Longbow Helicopter.  The RWR provides cockpit indication of enemy RF missile activity and alerts the pilot of appropriate countermeasure to defeat the threat.  This automated testing capability provides the Army with a rapid capability to test a mission software solution that detects and defeats threats to Army Aviation platforms.</r2:Text>

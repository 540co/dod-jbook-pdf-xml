                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs, investigates, evaluates, and characterizes advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, and make decisions about and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battle space focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness. 

This Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE conducts fundamental research on Soldier Lethality technologies to develop an integrated Soldier and Squad architecture of equipment and systems that improve Soldier and Small Combat Unit survivability, sustainability, mobility, combat effectiveness, and individual cognitive and physical readiness. To address the challenges of integrating multiple technologies and sub-systems, research conducted in this PE, significant Science and Technology applied research investments in all areas of Soldier Lethality focus on how to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes and apply systems-level practices to mitigate constraints from size and weight of the equipment. Research areas encompass individual and crew-served weapon designs and technologies as well as applied research in lightweight and transparent armor materials to mitigate effects from blast and ballistic threats, counter explosive hazard detection, counter-sensor capabilities, and signature management of weapons, equipment, personnel and high value targets. This PE investigates, develops and designs materials, technologies, methodologies and system models required to experiment and optimize Soldier lethality and survivability through investments in mobility, human-agent teaming, and improved situational awareness interfaces and display technologies as well as to provide Soldier-borne power and energy materials and components that support multiple Soldier-borne systems. This PE also investigates Warfighter training technologies and develops the underpinning technologies to establish architecture standards and interfaces necessary for creating realistic synthetic environments to create a single, interconnected synthetic training system to enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon / multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. Human Factors Engineering projects conduct applied research to design weapon systems standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training curriculum and tools. 

Results of these efforts are transitioned within the Army Futures Command, the Program Executive Offices, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).

Work in this PE complements PE 0603118A, Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology.

There are no new starts in this Program Element.

All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project advances the understanding of human augmentation and interaction for enhanced operational performance with a focus on adaptation, training, human variability, metrics/methodologies for assessment, and task quantification.  Research encompasses conducting applied research to develop metrics, measures, tools, and techniques to quantify and understand the relationships that enable maximum effectiveness of integrated Soldier-augmentation technologies. The resulting data are the basis for physical augmentation systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, and intelligent agent requirements to improve equipment operation and Soldier-system synergy. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, reduced Soldier training requirements, enhanced Soldier lethality/survivability, user acceptance, and allow Soldiers to achieve maximum performance. Major efforts explore novel techniques for Soldier assessment, characterization of individual variability effects on performance, development of evidence based design guidance for the application of augmentation technologies, exploration of the relationship of exoskeleton and physical assist device adaptation and baseline Soldier parameters such as gait, neuromuscular motor control and proprioception. This Project will also explore novel training paradigms for reduced Soldier-augmentation technology adaptation times to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit wearable sensor technologies, translate surrogate task performance to operational outcomes, develop approaches to distinguish tasks and individual state and intent of movement, establish database of human movement variability to inform intelligent system design, and identify high impact applications of augmentation. 

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and leverages the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) / Project BC2 (Next Gen Mobility &amp; Lethality Tech for Warfighters), Project BB9 (Human Performance Tech for Mobility &amp; Lethality), and Project BC6 (Human Perf - Tech for Warfighter Enhancement) and supports PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) / Project BC1 (Human Performance AdvTech for Mobility &amp; Lethality), Project BB6 (Physical Augmentation: Adv Tech for Field Demo), and Project BB8 (Soldier Centric Advanced Technology).  Additionally, work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the Medical Research and Materiel Command under the Military Operational Medicine Research Program within PE 0602787A (Medical Technology) / Project 869 (Warfighter Health Prot &amp; Perf Stnds), and the Veteran Administration's exoskeleton research area.

* Project C90 Advanced Distributed Simulation</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research on Cyber Electromagnetic (CEMA) threat and friendly/coalition counter CEMA efforts as well as human behavior variables that influence CEMA operations and the outcomes of CEMA attacks. The resulting outcomes create analytical and empirical capabilities to characterize, model, and forecast human behavior related to CEMA events through experimentation and field data collection.  The result is increased mission effectiveness that enables strong mission command, intelligence operations, and cyber defenses, which lead to high information sharing, situational awareness, and collaboration. Major efforts focus on applied research to understand the conduct of effective CEMA operations in that knowledge is required to create and effectively deploy cyber work systems that optimize human-machine interactions and account for operator and adversary behavior to achieve maximum effects.  This Project addresses Army gaps and needed capabilities by conducting cyber cognition and teaming assessments as well as studying human behaviors in CEMA-physical environments, attacker-defender-user dynamics, and Soldier-system integration challenges that underlie forces ability to converge kinetic, cyber and electromagnetic activities.  Results will inform technology selection and development, training assessments, system specifications, and operational planning.

Results of these efforts are transitioned to Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Program Managers, Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy, as well as the Office of the Secretary of Defense Close Combat Lethality Task Force.

FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.

The STE will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon / Multi-Domain Operations, combined arms maneuver, and mission command training at the point of need anywhere in the world, increasing Soldier and Small Unit proficiency through repetition. Units can then master collective training tasks in the live environment.

This Project investigates and designs STE enabling technologies to include networking of models representing complex human behavior, complex data
interchange between simulations, synthetic natural environments, virtual representation of combined arms environments, adaptive tutoring for individuals and teams, and collaborative training.

Project efforts include techniques and methods for integrating different sensory cues into virtual environments that result in enhanced training and leader development and the design of virtual humans utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled attributes that embody natural language, speech recognition in noisy environments, gesture, gaze, and conversational speech
and other complex human tasks.

* Project XW5  Small Unit Expeditionary Maneuver Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the research and investigation of component technologies to enhance cargo and personnel airdrop capabilities for global precision delivery, rapid deployment, and insertion for force projection into hostile regions. Areas of emphasis include parachute technologies, parachutist injury reduction, precision offset aerial delivery, soft landing technologies, and airdrop simulation.  Technologies support the Soldier Lethality Army Modernization Priority.  New operational concepts call for increased precision of personnel and cargo in austere environments in which small units are dispersed and logistical supply is limited.  The Army requires enhanced payload extraction and other increased capabilities to support the airdrop requirement for current and future vehicles exceeding aircraft payload weight capacity. The U.S. Army Airborne Board (Chaired by the XVIII Airborne Corps Commanding General) identified increased payload capabilities as a critical requirement to support the mission readiness profile for the Global Response Force (GRF), and will support Joint Forcible Entry requirements while maximizing the capacity of a C-17 aircraft.  

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and complements the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences),  PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) / Project BD6 (Soldier Sys Interfaces/ Integration- Sensor Tech), and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) /Project BE5 (Personnel &amp; Airdrop Safety Advanced Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This research investigates and develops standoff robotic capabilities for Combat Engineers to reduce Soldier/Engineer risks and fatalities while conducting activities essential to shaping the environment. It will close the gaps between commercial construction equipment and the requirements of the future Engineer Force to support maneuver, movement, and sustainment. This research will develop the capability to generate a near real-time site model with appropriate engineering details to allow unmanned shaping of the environment through physical interaction (e.g. push, pull, lift, or dig). This effort will also develop the requisite mission planner and task execution controller that accepts input from the user and provides suggestions and feedback based on updates to the site model, reporting from hardware agents, and resource allocation logic. The end state goal is the development of beyond visual line of sight teleoperation and semiautonomous capabilities allowing Engineer robotic support to match pace in near term and future combat environments. This effort will support the development, testing, and evaluation of prototypical robotic Combat Engineer equipment.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project performs the applied research to design capabilities for reduced vehicle crew sizes to successfully operate a larger number of closed-hatch manned and remote unmanned vehicles in a complex multi-domain operations environment. This Project will enable future crews to perform complex missions with increasingly sophisticated technologies, and in increasingly complex, dynamic socio-technical environments. The applied research will provide the fundamental technologies to enable integrated performance-improving Learning - Warfighter Machine Interfaces (WMIs) that are scalable to multiple crew hardware and functional configurations; reconfigurable frameworks and simulation for concept experimentation and exploration; and team-centered dynamic tasking by machine intelligence to effectively utilize full capabilities of crew and technologies.  The research will generate soldier-informed data, reports, and analysis to support operational use in future vehicles; and soldier experimentation and assessment of technical concepts in simulation and in-field WMIs. The capabilities created by this research will lead to increased overall crew and team performance; improved soldier safety due to fewer soldier per vehicle, closed-hatch operations, and improved standoff from effective control; and vehicles that can effectively perform across multiple domains of battle.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project researches advanced materials and mechanisms to defeat the most common and most dangerous threats that are expected to be encountered by our ground forces in near, mid and far term. Work conducted in this Project will result in concepts for Adaptive and Cooperative Protection of ground combat vehicles.  Modern protective technology implements complex kinematic mechanisms in order to bend, break and disperse threat projectiles before they can injure crew or disable vehicles.  These "mechanisms" of the future will have unprecedented access to information through advanced sensors (electro-optic, infrared, radio frequency, magnetic, acoustic), data, communications, high speed digital signal processing, and fusion of information to initiate high-speed controls and actuation to adjust and adapt protective measures and materials.  The research strategy will develop experimental and computational tools and techniques (high resolution instrumentation to observe impact events, theories and algorithms to explain these phenomena and numerical implementation of these algorithms) for the development of mass-efficient armor mechanisms.  Complimentary armor mechanisms will be co-developed to create multi-threat armor technologies that meet specific military requirements and these will form the building blocks for Adaptive and Cooperative Protection Technologies.  Additionally research will focus on subcomponent/component models to predict performance of early concepts and the means to evaluate effectiveness on ground platforms.  The Project will balance developments of active threat defeat measures with the necessary advanced passive and reactive components that will ultimately provide for full system solutions which meet the requirements of current and next generation ground tactical and combat vehicles.  The Emerging Overmatch Technologies effort will maximize the synergy between protection technologies that are complimentary to the lethality mission to re-establish overmatch of Army technologies.  

This Project is coordinated with and transition to Projects in PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and builds upon weapon target interaction research in PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences) / Project AA7 (Mechanics and Ballistics).

The cited work is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command. 

Work in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort contributes to the Army's ground vehicle survivability by developing technologies which electronically or physically defeat an incoming threat before it contacts the vehicle. These technologies involve sensors and effectors interacting with an incoming threat to disrupt or destroy in while it is in flight or before it is even fired at a vehicle. This effort designs and develops modern armors that directly complement active defense technologies in order to implement sophisticated mass efficient mechanisms and leverage investments in materials to act as a system for the defeat of advanced threats.  This effort designs and develops active blast mitigation technologies to counter the effects of underbody attacks to ground vehicles. This effort will also design and develop the required advanced structures required to accommodate active blast mitigation technologies into vehicles. The design of the structure and active defense technology is critical to an effective blast survivability solution.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs and develops Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies to increase autonomy and mobility to perform teamed operations with manned and unmanned air and ground vehicles in a military relevant environment through data collection on relevant platforms. Data collection investigates the usage of both simulation and live data. Simulation will provide a baseline to collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for developing algorithms to enable both intelligent formation control and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) map input for Unmanned Ground Vehicle Mobility.  This Project will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using ML and other AI methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI/ML techniques to develop intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for Global Positioning System. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to develop algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI/ML techniques to develop intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAV mapped areas. Data collected from the UAV will be converted to maneuverable information for manned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures an integrated Virtual Prototyping capability that investigates Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) technology integration into a range of novel ground vehicle design concepts that will be analyzed and evaluated through virtual experimentation to provide engineering data and operational feedback to inform NGCV analysis and requirements.  Designs and analyzes novel NGCV system level ground vehicle concepts by integrating advanced mobility, survivability, lethality, sensing and electrical/electronic technologies to address emerging and future advanced threats.  This Project provides system level ground vehicle design concepts and performance analysis, assesses cost and performance trades, and provides real-time soldier feedback on technology performance for the Army's NGCVs.  Technologies to be evaluated include high efficiency advanced powertrains, power generation, active protection systems, active blast, advanced lethality and robotic control and autonomy technologies.  The NGCV virtual experiments provide an efficient means to give warfighters an up-front, virtual hands-on operational evaluation of next generation ground vehicle concepts and emerging technologies.  The Virtual Prototyping results provide critical inputs to the Army's NGCV program by providing independent technical and operational performance results, as well as assessing trades for the Army's next generation of ground combat vehicles.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project addresses sustainment operations by unburdening the Soldier and reducing logistics requirements (e.g., fewer batteries) for communications, computing, and sensing. The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and distributed sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by distributed electronics is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF and optoelectronic circuits, devices, materials and wireless power (and data) transfer. 

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops next generation geospatial analytical tools for 3D complex environments for low echelon and tactical edge exploitation. Research focuses on improving geospatial and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) aspects of situational awareness at the tactical edge in the complex environment by exploiting new data sources, automating analytical tasks, and testing new collection technologies, including interiors of infrastructure. Research develops capabilities to enhance/update provisioned (baseline) standard, sharable, geospatial foundation (SSGF) data through automated analytics on multi-sourced spatial data resulting in streamlined, enhanced high fidelity terrain analysis products. Reducing data gaps and processing timelines will greatly increase Soldier situational awareness and support faster decision making in complex terrain.

* Project H71 Meteorological Research for Battle Command</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops tactical atmospheric sensing, modeling, and decision support technologies. New atmospheric sensing technologies are developed that enable near-real-time, high-resolution measurements of atmospheric parameters via light-weight systems that can be employed in tactical domains. Efforts include high-resolution local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions that can accommodate the effects of dense urban and complex, mountainous terrain. Both physics-based and rule-based decision support systems are developed for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution; battlefield visualization; reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web-enabled tactical decision aids, long-range precision fires; and modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games

This work provides technologies for evaluation by and/or transitions to the Department of Defense weather and operations community including: Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammunition-PM Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) for meteorological message input to field artillery targeting systems; Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A); the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) to improve their operational weather support to the Army.

* Project H94 Elect &amp; Electronic Dev</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops technologies that will enable precise and assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments.  This research addresses the PNT Scenarios 1 (GPS operations that start good and have good GPS signals throughout the mission duration) through Scenario 3 (GPS operations have 'bad' or limited availability of GPS signals throughout the entire mission).  This is achieved with research addressing the ability to transmit jam-resistant, precision timing synchronized signals using optical fibers, free-space using lasers, and in the RF domain using innovative radio frequency (RF) antenna concepts to extend the reach of Soldier compatible capabilities in heavily contested GPS environments.   

This Project also develops technologies addressing the PNT's toughest Scenario - Scenario 4 (no available GPS signal during the mission duration) with a goal of enabling Soldier missions of up to 7 days in a GPS denied environment.  This conducts research in advanced quantum timing circuits, advanced inertial measurement unit (IMU) components, multi-sensor modalities, perception techniques, geolocation data, vision aided navigation sensors, and available RF signals.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                <r2:Description>This effort will deliver reconfigurable micro- and nano-scale filtering devices enabling frequency agile multi-task sensors. This  will permit enhanced survivability of the FVL platforms with restored visual overmatch in any (day/night) environment. This will allow visual penetration of natural obscurants (e.g. brownout, white out) or custom man-made obscurants (e.g. engineered smokescreens) from a single sensor, as well as narrowband filtering for active imaging through obscurants.  Improved detection and identification capability will result from filtering out scattered light and enabling 3-dimensional ranging through environmental obscurants.  Wavelength agile imaging systems will be delivered that are capable of penetrating and imaging through a variety of obscurants and that are compatible with the FVL platforms.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates component technologies for a 100 kilowatt (kW)-class, mobile high energy laser (HEL) weapon system to protect fixed and semi-fixed sites from Rocket, Artillery, and Mortars (RAM) and UAS threats. The project researches advanced technologies for HEL weapon systems to enable more efficient laser systems with greater power output, which in-turn enables future laser weapons on smaller vehicles for additional missions. This includes technologies to support development of alternate laser sources, precision optical pointing and tracking components, adaptive optics to overcome laser degradation due to atmospheric effects, more compact and lighter weight energy generation and storage devices, and more efficient thermal management systems to remove excess heat.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components, both hardware and software, that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) guided missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. It focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. Project CYB designs, creates, evaluates, and applies emerging cyber techniques and cyber situational awareness technologies to enhance Army capabilities and to mitigate risks and investigates cyber collection and mapping technologies to offer real time cyber situational awareness to enable interpretation of current threats and predict future enemy activities.

This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fused munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This Project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

Among these were novel designs enabled multi-role munitions (e.g. Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar, Counter Unmanned Aircraft System) such as shaped charge (SC) and multi explosively formed penetrators (MEFP?s) developed to address emerging threats.  In addition, further designs in controlled and scalable blast fragmentation were pursued to concentrate lethality while reducing collateral damage. Continued the design process to provide lethality solutions to cluster munition replacements as well as continue maturing novel area clearance concepts; validated component technologies in a relevant environment.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies. These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with, and as appropriate leveraged by, DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, Soldier and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Portfolios.

The work in this Project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT).  

All FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort addresses sustainment operations by unburdening the Soldier and reducing logistics requirements (e.g., fewer batteries) for communications, computing, and sensing. The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and unattended sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to RF communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution. Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of five key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, wireless power transfer, and advanced battery chemistries.  Additionally, materials and devices used for photonic applications, such as laser diodes and fiber lasers, will be studied and improved with an emphasis on overall size, weight, and power consumption efficiency gains.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This research focuses on technologies that will enable precise and assured position, navigation and timing in global positioning system (GPS)-denied environments. The first objective of this research is to improve the size, weight, power, cost, and accuracy of current micro-Inertial Measurement Systems (IMS) through the design, and fabrication of MEMS gyroscopes. The second objective is to develop an opto-electronic device that can be used as an ultra-precise local oscillator with improved stability for precision timing applications. The third objective is to address the ability to transmit jam-resistant precision timing signals by investigating the transmission of precision, synchronized timing signals over optical fibers and free-space using lasers. The fourth objective is to explore new RF antenna concepts to extend the reach of IMS systems through pseudolites (ground-based substitutes for GPS satellites) and Soldier-borne systems, and to integrate multiple sensor modalities with the IMSs using sensor fusion techniques to reduce drift and increase positional accuracy.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research and develops component technologies that enable improved Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA), and situational understanding (SU). Technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), lasers, and electronics. It also includes modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness of these technologies. Research focuses on infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track targets in all day/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in all operational environments. This Project designs, fabricates, and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational understanding, persistent surveillance, and hostile fire detection. This Project investigates and designs novel sensor electronics such as Digital Read Out Integrated Circuits (DROICs) to enable multifunction sensing. This Project also investigates and matures new semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from the periodic table. In addition, this Project develops algorithms for enhanced IR functionality, which provides the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets. The reduction of size, weight and power - Cost (SWaP-C) is a key research objective for all efforts.

All FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

This Project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The Project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE investigates and advances technologies, techniques, and tools for representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric, and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and force protection planning and operations; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities. Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and develops software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and develops materiel solutions, including rapidly emplaced bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with protective construction and critical infrastructure. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to assess non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.

*Project BK7 Robotics for Engineer Operations Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops technologies and techniques to support robotic and autonomous operations capabilities, ensure sustainable, cost efficient, and effective facilities, and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and expeditionary operations. The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, and homeland security. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the capability of autonomous engineering during combat operations to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk/threat and dynamic environments, enables installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and on-demand expeditionary structures, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in contingency operations, including urban environments.

All FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

The work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and advances technologies to characterize and respond to impacts of the terrestrial environment on the performance of emerging and deployed Army systems, as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on all phases of unified land operations. Research efforts model the dynamics of electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic propagation in response to changing terrain state and complex terrain features and geometry, and their depiction in geospatial information and mission command systems. Numerical modeling of weather effects on terrain properties supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command-delivered solutions to the Soldier. The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.

All FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) designs and validates applied behavioral and social science research to enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, and leader development) and human relations (e.g., unit cohesion). This PE develops new personnel measures and methods that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE develops new performance measures and metrics for individuals and units, designs innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints. 

Work in this PE complements PE 0603007A (Manpower, Personnel and Training Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Vision, the Army's Talent Management Strategy, and the Army Modernization Strategy.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the United States Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use. 

Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology
Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

* Project MK4 Warfighter Health Applied Rsch Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts research to prevent and protect Warfighters from training and operational injuries; refine mechanisms for detection of physiological (human physical and biochemical function) and psychological (mental) health problems; evaluate hazards to head, neck, spine, eyes, and ears; set the standards for rapid return to duty, and determine new methods to sustain and enhance performance across the operational spectrum. This research provides medical information important to the design and operational use of military systems, and this work forms the basis for behavioral, training, pharmacological (drug actions), and nutritional interventions. 

The four main areas of study are:

(1)	Environmental Health and Protection
(2)	Physiological Health and Performance
(3)	Injury Prevention and Reduction
(4)	Psychological Health and Resilience

Additionally, the Warfighter Systems Engineering Architecture task advances medical science and technology in the areas of injury prevention and performance sustainment in the context of human interaction with new Soldier systems, and provides greater insight into informing new research in developing Warfighter systems and the interactions between Warfighters and the systems they employ.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

FY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.

Program Element (PE) 0602787A Medical Technology
* Project MM8 Infectious Diseases and Applied Rsch Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.

Research conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:

(1) Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases
(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control
 
For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort assesses and improves on candidate drugs coming from the Department of Defense (DoD) discovery program and from other collaborations for prevention and treatment of malaria; to counter the continuing spread of drug resistance to current drugs; assesses currently available drugs for use against cutaneous leishmaniasis (a skin-based disease transmitted by sand flies) in animal models; and select the most effective and safe candidates for continued refinement and possible clinical testing. This effort also conducts studies to investigate new candidate vaccines for preventing malaria and selects the best candidate(s) for continued refinement. A highly effective vaccine would reduce or eliminate the use of anti-malarial drugs and would minimize the progression and impact of drug resistance to current/future drugs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts research to prevent and protect Warfighters from training and operational injuries; refine mechanisms for detection of physiological (human physical and biochemical function) and psychological (mental) health problems; evaluate hazards to head, neck, spine, eyes, and ears; set the standards for rapid return to duty; and determine new methods to sustain and enhance performance across the operational spectrum. This research provides medical information important to the design and operational use of military systems, and this work forms the basis for behavioral, training, pharmacological (drug actions), and nutritional interventions.

The four main areas of study are:
(1)	Environmental Health and Protection
(2)	Physiological Health and Performance
(3)	Injury Prevention and Reduction
(4)	Psychological Health and Resilience

Additionally, the Warfighter Systems Engineering Architecture task advances medical science and technology (S&amp;T) in the areas of injury prevention and performance sustainment in the context of human interaction with new Soldier systems, and provides greater insight into informing new research in developing Warfighter systems and the interactions between Warfighters and the systems they employ.

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A (Medical Advanced Technology) / Project MG4 (Tech Base/Enabling Research in Military Occupation), Project MN6 (Blast &amp; Head Impact Exposure Monitor Advanced Tech), Project MN7 Musculoskeletal Injury Screening Tool Adv Tech, Project MN9 Far Forward Behavioral Health Care Advanced Tech, Project MO3 Military Occupational Fitness Standards Adv Tech, Project MO8 Expeditionary Performance Nutrition Advanced Tech, and Project MP3 Phys Chem Toxicity Assessment Sys Adv Tech.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports biological and clinical applied research using the data analysis and integration grid (SysBioCube) as an overarching means of complex data usage to solve critical health problems. The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is the integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, using global multi-omic methods to identify and discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions (physiologic, immunologic, endocrine, etc.), supporting transition of research to clinical applications. This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement as seen in biomarker development for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and enhanced analyses of coagulopathy. Another application of systems biology is to characterize physiological pathways altered by toxic substances enabling identification of the causative toxic substances as well as to understand the injury mechanisms. The detection/identification of physiological markers of exposure to toxic substances can then be used to support medical countermeasure decisions or development of targeted therapeutic drugs.

These examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to Projects studying biological systems have been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                <r2:Description>The core capability for multidisciplinary applied research in systems biology enables integration and analysis of complex data from human and animal studies and development of computational network models, allowing researchers to differentiate among molecular signatures (unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions) of disease, and supports transition of research to clinical applications for diseases of military relevance. Applied research is being conducted to identify biological networks that are causative of illness in PTSD and co-morbidities (presence of one or more diseases or disorders), coagulopathy (impaired ability to clot blood) of trauma, traumatic brain injury, pain, suicide, infectious disease, and immune responses. In particular, the studies of PTSD are directed to refine biomarkers for screening, early diagnosis and therapeutic target discovery.</r2:Description>

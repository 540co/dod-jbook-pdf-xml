                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project, as the nation’s primary basic research portfolio solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific progress across the spectrum of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) CWMD mission areas. This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development budget projects.

This project aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction and consequence management communities. The portfolio addresses this guidance through S&amp;T investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Program managers drive interdisciplinary portfolios primarily drawing from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and information and network sciences. The portfolios themselves are broadly focused on fundamental, exploratory research to support the development of: standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; nuclear detection in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; WMD agent defeat technologies; and biologically-based and -inspired materials for DoD applications.

This project maintains a robust, forward-looking portfolio targeting mission-focused research demonstrating scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for breakthrough discoveries.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease in FY 2020 is due to reduced investment in basic research to fund increased investment in technical reachback and quick reaction capabilities in Project RA-CWMD Cross-Cutting Technical and Information Sciences in Program Element 0603160BR.  The Basic Research portfolio was restructured to establish a University Partnership (UP) model with a new prioritization process. This process will focus novel UP research on high-priority CWMD gaps, to include energetics and reactives, nuclear data, weapons effects, materials science, machine learning, radiation biology, advanced analytics, and other critical areas.  This model reduces administrative burdens and increases technical collaboration with partners focused on current and emerging areas of interest thereby allowing for reduced investment in FY 2020.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project, as the nation’s primary basic research portfolio dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) mission areas. This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.

This project aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community. The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; securing vulnerable materials; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.

This project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD. The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation. Each research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions. This research will enable new capabilities to: better understand the environment, threats and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and/or dispose of WMD threats; and safeguard the force by managing consequences.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The increase in FY 2020 supports investment in applied research looking for disruptive technologies that will provide a greater than 70% solution to the following investment areas: Stand-Off Detection, Anti-Armor IED (AAIED), System Attributes across the Portfolio (Machine Learning, &amp; Artificial Intelligence), as well as increased investment in future-threat forecasting and innovative analytical research studies leveraging expertise from academia and research institutions in government and industry. These areas of investment continue to be identified time and again as challenging problem sets for the warfighters as identified by the CCMDs and warfighting commands in the CCMD integrated priority lists and JUONs. This is all in support of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research &amp; Engineering ASD(R&amp;E) guidance and congressional testimony to provide the technological foundation that ensures the U.S. military of both today and tomorrow is the most capable in the fight against IEDs and emerging improvised threats. These resources will be applied to the following: designing and fabricating ultra-light weight auxetic structures that significantly reduce damage to vehicles through reducing deflection upon impact from mine blast; developing the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and unmanned aerial vehicle cameras needed to create a 3D map of an environment; developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methodologies to enable human understanding of Machine Learning decisions; developing fusion strategies to improve Machine Learning algorithms by including human-in-the- loop knowledge into its learning strategies; developing methods to optimize algorithms through artificial intelligence and machine learning; and forecasting future threat scenarios and threat network resiliency.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Applied Research program element funds the application and advancement of basic scientific knowledge to develop novel materials, devices, systems, and methods supporting next generation concepts and technologies, to include advances in Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification.

This Applied Research portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction established annually by DTRA, which directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances DTRA’s CWMD mission by balancing the following: invest in DTRA’s applied research capabilities and increase the CWMD technology base to maximize future pay-off; capitalize on opportunities to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges that must be resolved prior to system-specific technology investigations and development; and ensure applied research efforts are directly aligned to the mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following related areas.

1.  Research, development, test, and evaluation to identify, develop, and exploit signatures associated with nuclear threats in support of U.S. capabilities that detect and interdict such threats; and locate, identify, and track special nuclear material and improve detection factors such as range, time, sensitivity, and accuracy to enhance Service and Special Mission Unit capabilities. These efforts support DoD requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.

2.  Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine technical capabilities needed to improve Department of Defense (DoD) contingency planning activities; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear.

3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.

4. Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

***Project RG title changes from Defeat Technologies to Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development in FY 2020</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following areas.

1.  Defeat Technologies develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of WMD, while minimizing collateral effects. Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both. It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation CWMD capabilities. The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials. Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to Budget Activity (BA) 3, Advanced Technology Development (ATD) efforts. On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.

2.  WMD counterforce technologies research develops weapons effects modeling algorithms, full and sub-scale test series required to investigate CWMD weapon effects and sensor performance, and visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation Technical Reachback cell. These activities are critical enablers for the development of advanced CWMD planning tools. Energetics research develops materials and weapon design technology providing defeat capabilities for engaging hard and deeply buried targets that are beyond current high explosive blast/fragmentation warhead technology. Life sciences research develops technologies to find, locate, mitigate, and defeat WMD using bio-organisms or components.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities. Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering WMD Test and Evaluation project provides a unique national test capability for simulated WMD facilities and processes. This capability provides structured and systematic end-to-end test event planning, preparation, management, execution, and data analysis. It also offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management. The project leverages 50 years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD. Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels. This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The increase in FY 2020 supports the continuation of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) at a higher level of funding than in FY 2019. FY 2020 supports increased investments in Advanced Technological Development (ATD) focused on Disruptive Technologies providing a greater than 70% solution to the following areas: Buried Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Attack the Network, Home-Made Explosives (HME), and System Attributes across the Portfolio Range including Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence. Strategically aligned investments include increased investments in improved autonomous capabilities supporting the detection and defeat of improvised threats and the integration of Artificial Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR) into C-IT capabilities.  These areas of investment continue to be identified time and again as challenging problem sets for the warfighters as identified by the CCMDs and warfighting commands in their Integrated Priority List (IPLs) and Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON).  The Continuation of ATD activities is critical to advancing current initiatives to the prototype phase in the following areas: Remote Controlled IED (RCIED) &amp; Stand-off Detection.  This investment supports further development, testing, and prototyping of advanced Modelling, Visualization, and Simulation capabilities for processor-intensive analytics to support warfighters operating in tactical environments. The capability directly supports mission planning, targeting, and post-operation analysis by troops operating in tactical theaters of operation. For example, the capability will support mission planning by providing first-person experiential mission planning through immersion in a 3-D virtual model of a target mission environment that is augmented by inputs from multiple sensor platforms. The tactical user may interact with the virtual model of the target mission environment through head-mounted and/or handheld devices. Mission planning augmented in this manner may improve targeting accuracy and provide improved force protection in tactical environments.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

DTRA's continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces enables early identification and understanding of Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) and Counter-Improvised Threat (C-IT) gaps, vulnerabilities, and risks and the timely validation, resourcing, development, and delivery of C-IED and C-IT material and non-material solutions. DTRA's technical integrators embedded with deployed forces further enables rapid adjustments to solutions as the threat’s adaptation evolves.

DTRA provides DoD up to an 18-month “head start” on addressing critical warfighter gaps, and enables DoD to deliver the most technologically advanced response to improvised threats. These capabilities are developed from previous Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO) experience and in concert with other government agencies, National Labs, Academia, Private Industry, and International Partners.

This project employs Technology Outreach as well as development of modeling-and-simulation and analysis support tools to identify and validate urgent and emergent capability requirements and associated gaps. It provides rapid acquisition and delivery of C-IED and C-IT solutions to address these requirements and gaps.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Technology Development portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives as well as with Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction which is established annually by DTRA. The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) Efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&amp;T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

There is zero real growth in this project.

**Project RD title changes from Detection Technologies to Nuclear Technologies and Capabilities Development in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>1.  Research, development, test, and evaluation to identify, develop, and exploit signatures associated with nuclear threats in support of U.S. capabilities that detect and interdict such threats; and locate, identify, and track special nuclear material and improve detection factors such as range, time, sensitivity, and accuracy to enhance Service and Special Mission Unit capabilities. These efforts support DoD requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.

2.  Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine technical capabilities needed to improve Department of Defense (DoD) contingency planning activities; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear.

3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.

4.  Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following areas.

1.  Defeat Technologies develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.

2.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved. Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability. Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.

3.  Counter-terrorism technologies research develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent WMD threats. This research supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two areas: (1) counter proliferation research is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development and acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; (2) counterterrorism concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander, USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.

4.  Counterforce technologies research develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions capabilities to find, characterize, assess, and plan for the defeat of WMD threats. This research is focused in three areas: (1) WMD battlespace awareness provides warfighters with tools to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats; (2) The weapons effects research provides modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations; (3) innovative engineering of select promising technologies discovered under fundamental and basic research to increase the effectiveness of weapons against blast doors and other underground structures for functional defeat of Underground Facilities (UGFs), WMD, and their delivery systems.

5.  DTRA provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated weapons of mass destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing. This test bed is capable of responding to operational needs outside of DTRA’s research portfolio and is used by the DoD, Military Services, Combatant Commanders, and other Federal Agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional weapons, and other special weapons used against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets.

6.  Target assessment technologies research develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates, and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of WMD target assessment, automated advanced targeting development (A2TD) and full dimensional defeat. This research develops analytical tools and processes required to: (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs); and (2) assess the results of physical and functional defeat mechanisms (such as direct attack). The A2TD initiative seeks to apply emerging computer assisted technologies to automate target characterization for hard targets and WMD targets.  The end result will be faster and more efficient characterization of important hard targets and WMD targets. The full dimensional defeat project aims to develop an enterprise capability for finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts. The dynamic capabilities encompassed in this effort provide Combatant Commands and the intelligence community tools and processes needed to hold at risk high value hard targets and WMD targets possessed by adversaries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy. The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments. The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Target Assessment Technologies project develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates, and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) target assessment and functional defeat.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and to (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Counter Improvised-Threat (C-IT) Technology Demonstration, Prototype Development, and Testing program element supports the development, demonstration, and testing of improvised threat defeat technologies to advance the JIDO analytical infrastructure, methods, and tools (JS) and enhance counter IED and counter small unmanned aerial system (JC) solutions. Advancements in advanced analytics include the continued production of custom software tools that leverage constantly-evolving machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms and methods increasing our ability to more quickly develop threat facilitation network connections and activities for the CCMDs. Driven by the current threat still facing deployed US forces, this investment also enables rapid development and delivery of capabilities that more-fully enable the identification, detection, prevention, neutralization, exploitation, and risk mitigation of IEDs, threat-small UASs, and their effects.

- Improve size, weight, power and integration of sensors to small unmanned systems.  
- Improve on-board vs. off-board data processing to provide real time data in unmanned systems to support real time improvised threat detection.
- Identify and develop portable technology to look through walls and identify hazards with fidelity in real-time for BTS.  
- Conduct proof of concept for unmanned vehicle that can autonomously operate within confined spaces and provide necessary imagery to operator for BTS.
- Integrate sensors to detect various anomalies in unstructured environment with the ability to detect through clothes and report in real-time at safe standoff distances in support of PBIED.
- Improve/develop detection and defeating sUAS (RCMA) capabilities against future technology, including acoustic detection at range, machine learning of constantly changing threat signatures (acoustic, RF signal, radar cross-section, optics, Unattended Radiated Emissions (URE), etc.).
- Develop anti-armor detection and defeat capabilities, to include real-time reporting from sensors on mounted vehicles that can detect roadside threats in high clutter, while operating at tactical speed, with high Positive Detection and acceptable False Alarm Rate. 
- Improve mounted detection of buried IEDs through real-time reporting from sensors on mounted vehicles that can detect buried threats at depths while conducting maneuver operations at speed with high Positive Detection and acceptable False Alarm Rate.  Hardware improvements enable faster sensing and software improvements enable faster systems-of-systems reporting (higher Positive Detection and lower False Alarm Rate). 
- Develop Machine Learning for counter improvised threat technologies and solutions to increase effectiveness of developed/developing capabilities.  This would enhance the effectiveness of solutions such as sensors’ ability to identify signatures, rapid identification, and detection of IED threats.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enhances US Joint Forces’ responsiveness to improvised weapons. DTRA builds counter-threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners. Through a robust communities of action approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) and Counter Improvised-Threat (C-IT) solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed US Joint Forces. This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire US Government and its partners as counter-improvised threat solutions are developed and realized.

DTRA responds to the following improvised threats: Home-Made Explosives (HME), Vehicle-Borne IED (VBIED), Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-sUAS) Vehicle-Attached IED (VAIED), Anti-Armor IED (AIED) Buried IED, Radio Controlled IED (RCIED), Personnel-Borne IED (PBIED), Booby Trapped Structures (BTS), Improvised WMD, Water-Borne IED (WBIED), improvised threats within tunnels, and emerging threats that are identified by the warfighter deployed forward.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project allows DTRA to rapidly develop, test and engineer analytical products, threat models and simulations, data science methodologies, software applications, and to integrate intelligence data sources that enable the rapid collection, fusion, and dissemination of operational-intelligence and technology in order to enable the defeat of threat networks that employ disruptive technologies.

The advanced Mission Information Technology (MIT) capability, its software Systems Integration Lab (SIL), and embedded Combatant Command (CCMD)-direct support and reach back staff, continuously create capabilities to ingest, fuse, analyze, and present mission relevant data and information that provides immediate assistance to DoD and the whole of government. This capability, called Catapult, is a fully accredited SIPR and JWICS based analytical cloud architecture. The Catapult architecture pulls from over more than 850 Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPR) and more than 170 Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) data sources and allows for simple and open data access, system stability, scalability, and advanced analytics. In addition to Catapult, the MIT created another significant capability called Voltron. Voltron provides analysts access to signals intelligence (SIGINT) data within a secure and IC-accredited software developer environment. Voltron, give analysts access to continuously new models in support of “Attack the Network” analysis and operations. Voltron provides analysts access to methodologies involving multi-INT fusion in an easy to use interface. These methods are based on years of experience supporting tactical targeting environment and built in collaboration with other teams across the Intelligence Community. There are currently more than 75 models in Voltron available to the user community.

DTRA's authorities and mission have enabled a unique “Path-to-Production” (PTP) for mission-driven IT solutions. This unique development environment includes an integrated Cyber Security Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) process, an in-house collateral Authorizing Official (AO), a strong partnership between technologists and intelligence analysts working real-world problems, and a collaborative and innovative culture that launches practical software solutions rapidly.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This will include the Common Intelligence Picture/Common Operational Picture and technical data and will serve as the platform for creation of Counter-IED/Counter-sUAS (C-IED/C-sUAS) analytics.
- Build a data science enabled module that will crawl through Catapult reporting and identify reports related to
IED/sUAS events. Through machine learning techniques and application of training data, the team will train this
module to identify reports that normal queries may miss. These reports will serve as the base data set for the CIED/
C-sUAS event table.
- Prepare a list of vetted IED/sUAS events pulled from Catapult reporting. Events will be broken down into
relevant categories with associated attributes.
- Stand up a database of technical data associated with known IED/sUAS. Library will be available for direct
query and incorporated into other C-IED/C-sUAS capabilities.
- Integrate Virtual Management System processes and capabilities to build 3D models for various maritime
vessels requested by external Special Operations Forces (SOF) customer.
- Develop and test a software mapping tool and spatial data analytics technology web service capable of a
providing user functionality to create basic geospatial analytic outputs (i.e., line of sight, route vulnerability, etc.).
- Generate additional Data Science tables populated with entities extracted from Catapult using RipIt regex

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The CWMD Cross-Cutting Technical and Information Sciences project develops mature technologies tied to existing programs in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s Budget Activity (BA) 3, Advanced Technology Development (ATD) portfolio. This investment helps bridge the developmental gap between science and technology and the advanced developers, effectively increasing the likelihood of transitioning capabilities to the warfighter.  This project focuses on development and demonstration of high fidelity models and prototypes for testing in an operational environment, evaluation of integrated systems, technology transition, and rapid insertion of CWMD capabilities to meet critical national security and defense priorities.  It specifically supports efforts to successfully transition capabilities from BA3 portfolio to advanced developers or into the hands of end-users for operational experimentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

1)	Meet a validated, current requirement from a Combatant Command or Service.
2)	Are approaching an appropriate level of maturity to transition to either an end-user for operational use and feedback or an advanced development partner.
3)	Require a finite amount of additional developmental work required to meet transition needs.
4)	Will provide operational capabilities to the warfighter community that enable efforts to counter threat networks.
Appropriate technologies will receive investment to meet these transition requirements and provide improved or new capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:Remarks>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations and a radionuclide analysis laboratory comprising the majority of the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This system delivers data continuously to the U.S. monitoring and verification community supports warfighter and interagency nuclear-event response in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) objectives and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).

The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to countering WMD. Technical assessments are made against nuclear treaty implementation and nuclear event response requirements to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide U.S. International Monitoring System (IMS) data, and to access international IMS data required to support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.

The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is to improve the efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of U.S. IMS stations; optimize IMS capabilities to support both nuclear treaty monitoring and nuclear-event response; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of nuclear events. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems. The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event. RDT&amp;E is conducted in support of the NACT’s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2020, efforts in this project are captured under project RD-Nuclear Technologies and Capabilities Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event.  RDT&amp;E is conducted in support of the NACT’s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.  CTBT IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Funding for MARMS prior to FY 2020 is captured in Program Element 0605170D8Z.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mission Assurance Risk Management System (MARMS) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management system that directly supports the Secretary of Defense's Mission Assurance (MA) responsibilities as defined in the DoD Directive (DoDD) 3020.40, Mission Assurance, with the objectives of creating resilience and supporting critical processes to enable the protection of assets and ensuring defense critical missions. MARMS will function as an integration framework spanning multiple security domains that will support risk-informed decision-making, resource investment, and improved synchronization at different levels within DoD. MARMS supports multiple Joint Capability Areas (JCA): Command and Control, Logistics, and Protection. MARMS is an acquisition category (ACAT) Ill software program and has a "high" impact value for each of the three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01 and the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MARMS Requirements Definition Package (RDP)-1 defines multiple spirals of major technological improvements.  Each spiral is comprised of multiple Capability Drops (CD) that defined specific capabilities. RDP-1 defined 7 capability drops focusing on the collection, analysis, warehousing, sharing, protection, and accessing of Defense Critical Infrastructure (DCI) and AntiTerrorism (AT) data supporting multiple types and levels of trusted users.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GlobalNET effort employs a spiral acquisition strategy ensuring a well-defined model for each institution/community that can be exported globally. The program uses an organizational approach to ensure sustainable, and updated technology and information sharing procedures. By partnering with other U.S. Government activities, existing assets are leveraged to preserve U.S. investments, avoid duplication of effort between activities, and offer economically prudent solutions to improve information sharing and achieve U.S. security cooperation goals. Independent Operational Test teams are brought on to ensure that GlobalNET bears independent validation of the development team’s effort.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>POCS development performance is measured in several methods: the successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting target dates in the project management plan; via a combination of statistics including the number of trouble tickets generated on the development site, operational user feedback on development site usability, and design; and the system’s performance during developmental and operational testing. The use of a 3rd party to execute the operational test ensures that the system meets the performance metrics prior to moving to production.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) is the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) enterprise system for enabling all facets of the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) appropriation.  It enables the stakeholders in Department of Defense (DoD) Humanitarian Assistance (HA) programs, including embassy staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and a broad range of DoD and interagency partners, the capability to manage, support, and visualize OHDACA funded projects on a web-based map display, in addition to automating report generation, providing tools to coordinate with Interagency and partner nation stakeholders, and perform a variety of analyses.

Currently OHASIS contains more than 19,000 projects valued at more than $1.2 billion, with a community of over 2,700 active users. The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and DoD civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, manage, and evaluate projects intended to assist the CCMDs in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program employs an incremental technology development and implementation strategy to ensure a desired capability is delivered in a relevant timeframe. This strategy will continue to leverage industry standard technologies for web development, database technology, database modeling, geographic information systems, reporting, and documentation. As additional users require the system, it will continue to be developed with scalability and maintainability as key considerations.
Additionally, this capability will help DoD better collaborate and support external agencies and their programs by leveraging the web services that have been designed in the initial baseline.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System (G-TSCMIS) initiative will provide a Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise-wide technology capability to facilitate and integrate planning, collaboration, program design, assessment, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting in support of all U.S. security cooperation activities.  To that end, the System will support the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of security cooperation by: (1) providing enterprise-wide access to authoritative Title 10 and Title 22 data that supports Security Cooperation (SC) oversight, management, and decision-making; (2) providing automated and configurable workflow management and reporting tools; and (3) incorporating functionality that enhances users’ situational awareness and ability to effectively plan. 
The development of this System will create a common operating picture for billions of dollars of security cooperation activities and a disparate workforce of more than 18,000 people.  It will combine and standardize data and work processes for more than 20 security cooperation authorities that currently rely on dozens of different systems and business practices.  

The System will increase efficiencies in the Department by: (1) promoting standardization of data and processes to increase efficiency without compromising user requirements; (2) minimizing duplicative data entry; and (3) reducing duplication in DoD systems wherever possible.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

User stories and scenarios will be developed to support testing.  Design reviews and planning efforts of new capabilities will be very technical and required full understanding of requirements.  New capabilities will include the ability for conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), and Military Department (MILDEP) stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD Common Access Card (CAC)/ Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DOD agencies such as the Dept. of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user’s organization is easily shared and accessible.  Further improvements will be accomplished on the Cross-Domain Solution (CDS), which will allow the transfer of data/documents from Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) to the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet); the addition of four Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes.

An increase of $6.589M from FY2017 to FY2018 is due to the required development contract award of the fourth release, Release 4.  New requirements resulted from the Joint Staff J6 Requirements Workshop in June 2015, National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 17 and NDAA 18 will added additional developmental efforts to future releases.  New capabilities will include the ability for assisting OSD Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development, conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD Cost Assessment and Performance Evaluation (CAPE), JS, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), CJCS, and MILDEP stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD CAC/ PKI Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DoD agencies such as the Department of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user’s organization is easily shared and accessible.  Further improvements will be accomplished on the CDS, which will allow the transfer of data/documents from the SIPRNet to the NIPRNet; the addition of four ADS which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>In FY 2019, the Department will continue work on two phases of work:

Phase 1 will build a new, cloud-hosted, user configurable, modular software platform upon which future capabilities can be built and demonstrate the ability to accept data from other Department of Defense (DoD) systems.  
Phase 2 will establish a new system and user interface that facilitate program management and reporting for all Security Cooperation (SC) authorities. Further, it will standardize data elements across authorities to facilitate comprehensive reporting and manage workflow and connect information across the program life-cycle: strategic, planning, proposal development, program development, execution, monitoring, and evaluation. It will also connect the system to additional DoD systems, building out the common operating picture and reducing redundant data entry.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System (G-TSCMIS) will follow the Rapid Information Technology (IT) Acquisition provided for in Section 804 of the 2010 NDAA. G-TSCMIS will initiate an evolutionary and iterative development process for a software-only solution using multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability to expedite delivery of capability to the end-user. The Department will rely on prototypes to confirm the product meets the need before moving to full fielding. At the same time, the Department will maximize COTS solutions to promote long-term viability, garner sustainment savings, and leverage state-of-the-art capabilities.  Finally, the Department will maintain Government ownership of any specialized coding and infrastructure configuration to ensure long-term flexibility in contracting.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <proc:Description>Ship Missile Support Equipment provides procurement and installation support to address fleet requirements for AEGIS Weapons System, Ships Self Defense System (SSDS), Vertical Launch System (VLS), NATO Seasparrow, Rolling Airframe Missile(RAM) Guided Missile Launcher System (GMLS), Anti-Ship Missile Decoy System NULKA, and Over The Horizon Weapon System (OTH WS).  

Stalker FY 18- FY 19
Improved situational awareness aboard CVNs and large deck amphibious ships; Accelerate fielding of integrated Stalker/SAws to meet the Fleet need for improved situational awareness.

[P40A / NATO SEASPARROW]: The NATO SEASPARROW Surface Missile System (NSSMS) is a shipboard Self-Defense Missile System.  In addition to the standard mission of Anti-Air and Anti-Surface Defense (AAW, ASUW), NSSMS is designed to protect ship and crew from a variety of inbound threats, including Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM), Fast Attack Craft/Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC/FIAC), Low Velocity Air Threats (LVAT), and a wide range of asymmetrical threats (e.g. Unmanned Aerial and Surface vehicles, small Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats, etc).  

Primary operations consist of acquiring targets either manually using radar search or Electro Optic/Infrared capability, or automatically via external or internal designations, generation of fire-control quality track data for engage ability determination, launcher control and missile initialization, queuing of other weapons (e.g. Rolling Airframe Missile) via the Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) or AN/SWY 3/5 Combat System, RIM-7H/M/P SEASPARROW missile and RIM-162D Evolved SEASPARROW Missile (ESSM) firing, target illumination for Missile Guidance and Visual Kill/Survive and Battle Damage Assessments.  

NSSMS provides manual or fully automatic operation with provisions for operator intervention or override from the time of target designation to missile away.  The legacy NSSMS configuration consists of Fire Control and Launcher Systems comprised of 2-4 Directors, a distributed computing network, Transmitter Group, 3-5 Operating Consoles, and 1-2 Eight-Cell missile Launchers which employ the surface launch variant of the Sparrow and ESSM.  The RIM-7 and RIM-162 missiles use semi-active guidance with target illumination provided by the shipboard MK 9/95 fire control systems.  NSSMS MK 57 Mods 12 and higher (ESSM capable) are integrated with the SSDS and become part of the SSDS MK 2 Combat System on CVN 68, LHA 6 and LHD 7-8 class ships. Starting with the Ford Class (CVN 78), the Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) is segmented from the MK 57 and interfaces directly to the SSDS Combat System; the CVN 78 effort is referred to as NSSMS Objective Configuration OC Phase 1 (OCP 1). 

NSSMS Objective Configuration Phase 2 (OCP 2) consists of the segmenting the MK 9 Track Illuminator System (TIS) to interface directly to with SSDS Combat System, as well as eliminating all MK 57 watch stations.  This watch station elimination dramatically reduces system life cycle costs for hardware, software, manning, training and maintenance and obsolescence requirements, also allowing the Navy to divest of RIM-7 and associated infrastructure.  Recent SSDS FRB activity has also created an incentive to consider MK 9 performance improvements opportunities.  

MK 29 modernization efforts address a variety of issues with the legacy MK 132 above deck launcher equipment, including achieving the desired Grade A shock qualification, solving missile loading/loader beam safety issues, missile environmental issues and future ESSM compatibility.  

The NSSMS is a NATO Cooperative Project with 12 participating Governments; Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Norway, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the United States.  The NSSMS and associated systems of the Cooperative Project were developed, produced and are supported under Department of Defense (DoD) International Memorandums of Understanding (MOU).

Funding provides for (1) equipment modernization, (2) NATO SEASPARROW Objective Configuration (OC) program consisting of segmenting and automating MK 9 Track Illuminator System interfacing directly to the SSDS Combat System, and (3) Stalker Long Range Electro-Optic Sensor System.

The MK 57 NSSMS continues to be evolved to provide credible ship self defense.  These equipment modernization upgrades will result in the ability of the MK 57 System to support future mission requirements. NSSMS MK 57 Mods 12 and higher (ESSM capable) are integrated with the SSDS and become part of the SSDS MK 2 Combat System.

The NATO SEASPARROW OC program consists of segmenting and automating the MK 9 Track Illuminator System (TIS) interfacing directly to the SSDS Combat System, eliminating all MK 57 watch stations, reducing system hardware, providing annual cost avoidance/savings, avoiding non-recurring engineering associated with integrating with CDS/CPS and allowing the Navy to divest of RIM-7 and associated infrastructure. Recent SSDS FRB activity has also created an incentive to consider MK 9 performance improvements opportunities.  MK 132 Modernization (above deck launcher portion of MK 29 GMLS) allows for the upgrades necessary to address a variety of issues with this legacy equipment, including Grade A shock deficiencies with the current design when employed with ESSM, missile loading issues, missile environmental issues and future ESSM capability.  The FY13 funding allocation on the Solid State Transmitter (SSTx) funding line is earmarked to support MK 9 improvements/modernization being driven by the FY12 SSDS combat system wholeness FRB/FLCIP initiate.  The funding will be used to procure 1 set of MK 9 improvements/modernization related qualification hardware and associated engineering efforts.  In contrast, the SSTx funding shown for FY14 and out will be used to procure production SSTx units.  

Improved Stalker (I-Stalker) will provide incremental improvements to the currently fielded Stalker Long Range Electro-Optic Sensor System (SLREOSS) in response to a 2016 United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) Operational Needs Statement (ONS).  SLREOSS was developed as a modular, portable, form/fit replacement for the NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System (NSSMS) MK 6 Low Light Level Television (LLLTV) in response to the 2010 Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) Counter Swarm Urgent Operational Need (UON) to combat Fast Attack Craft/Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC/FIAC).  It is currently being fielded in either the NSSMS MK6 MOD 3 LLLTV Director Mount configuration or NSSMS MK6 MOD 4 LLLTV Independent Mount configuration depending on platform specifications.  I-Stalker will provide required upgrades to the SLREOSS Independent Mount configuration with the enhanced capabilities provided by the Navy owned Situational Awareness System (SAwS) to deliver an integrated radar and electro-optic/Infrared control and display suite.

[P40A - 2 / RAM GMLS]: Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) - MK 49 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS):  RAM is a cooperative program with the Federal Republic of Germany, produced under a series of production MOUs/MOAs (the latest was signed on 19 March 2013) executed between the U.S. and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The MK-31 Guided Missile Weapon System (GMWS) is a lightweight, quick-reaction, high firepower missile system designed to provide anti-ship missile defense. The system is comprised of a MK-44 Guided Missile Round Pack (GMRP) and the MK 49 GMLS, which holds 21 RAM missiles. The 21-round launcher is compatible with various platforms ranging from large USN aircraft carriers to Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This system is designed to counter high density anti-ship, cruise missile raids and provide for ship survivability with accurate terminal guidance, proven lethality and no fire control illumination dependence.

Funding profile directly supports final installations and associated efforts of RAM Mod 3 upgrades on LSD class ships in accordance with ships installation/availability schedule.  Installation funding includes DSA planning and actual installation costs. Without this upgrade the Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) on these ships will only be able to fire RAM in manual mode. Funding also supports the procurement and installation of Tech Refresh/Safety/IA ORDALTS which are required to field RAM BLK 2A capabilities for increased performance improvements bringing amplified fire power to the fleet.  The RAM Fire Power ORDALT increases the number of missiles fired to meet self defense PRA requirements against evolving threat raid scenarios.  Without this ORDALT, L-class and CVNs will not be able to defend against emergent raid scenarios.  The firepower ORDALT also enables full use of the RAM Block 2B missile against raids.

[P40A - 3 / Ship Self Defense System]: The Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) is the core combat system control element for the Quick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC) in aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships to defend against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM).  SSDS integrates a diverse set of fire control loop sensors and weapons, and C4I systems for each ship class (CVN68/78, LHA6, LHD1, LPD17, and LSD41/49 ship classes).  SSDS MK2 provides the capabilities for integrated air and missile defense, multi-warfare situational awareness, combat direction, and joint interoperability via the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL)-J (Link 16). SSDS MK2 is being fielded with the new construction carriers (CVN78 class) and amphibious ships (LHA6, LPD17 classes). SSDS MK2 is replacing the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) in the LHD1 class, and SSDS MK1 in the LSD 41/49 class, as fleet modernization initiatives.  

SSDS MK2 integrates new combat system warfighting capabilities and improvements on phased basis via Advanced Capability Builds (ACB), Technology Insertion (TI), the Fire Control Loop Improvement Project (FCLIP), Far-Term Interoperability Improvement Project (FTIIP), and Task Force Cyber Awakening (TFCA) Boundary Defense Capability. New hardware Technology Insertion baselines are required every four years to refresh the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) assemblies to sustain system production and to support the incorporation of new ACB/war-fighting capabilities. Each individual ship is planned for a Technology Insertion upgrade on an eight to ten year interval to replace obsolescent COTS hardware and support the fielding of the capabilities. Technology refresh of individual COTS assemblies that are unprocurable or unsupported is handled on a case basis. 

SHIP SELF DEFENSE SYSTEM (SSDS) MK 1 provides ship self defense capabilities against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM) for LSD 41/49 class ships. It integrates several existing stand-alone sensor and Anti-Air Warfare weapons systems to provide an automated detect-to-engage capability against low flying, high speed ASCMs with low radar cross sections in the littoral environment. System design emphasizes physically distributed non-developmental items, commercial standards and computer program reuse in an open system architecture computer network. It includes a command table that uses components of the Navy's AN/UYQ-70 standard display for human-system interface, commercially available local area network access units and circuit cards, and commercially available fiber optic cabling. SSDS MK 1 requires a COTS obsolescence technology insertion and transitioned to an SSDS MK2 Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE)beginning with FY10 procurement for shore sites and lead ship installation in the LSD 50 in FY14.

SHIP SELF DEFENSE SYSTEM (SSDS) MK 2 provides Advance Combat Direction System (ACDS) functionality and SSDS MK1 capabilities with additional weapon and sensor elements. It is integrated with Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and tactical data links to provide joint interoperability for Aircraft Carriers and Amphibious Ships. It provides enhanced capabilities for Force Protection against air, surface, and subsurface threats using both own-ship and remote data in support of the Anti Air Warfare (AAW) Capstone Requirements. SSDS MK2 increases operational capabilities, improves combat readiness and Strike Group and Expeditionary Strike Group interoperability. SSDS MK 2 equips back-fit LHDs and CV(N)s with an upgraded Combat System Display, Automatic Status Board (ASTABS), Remote ASTAB Controllers, peripheral control stations and Advanced Sensor Distribution System (ASDS), as well as, the SSDS MK 2 computing equipment. Prior year procurement of SSDS MK 2 equipment included shore-based SSDS MK 2 equipment and full combat system suites for the Ship Combat System Center (SCSC), Wallops Island, Virginia; maintenance and operator training equipment at the Center for Surface Combat Systems (CSCS), Dam Neck, Virginia; and an equipment suite for the Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS), the SSDS MK2 System Integration Lab (SIL), Raytheon IDS, San Diego, and the Integrated Combat System Test Facility, at Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren.  FY16-FY22 includes the procurement of COTS Conversion Kits  for CVNs, LPDs, LHDs, LHAs and LSDs, and COTS Upgrade Kits / field changes for the shore sites used for SSDS software development/ maintenance, training, and Combat System integration and certification testing.  SSDS procurement also includes various Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) based systems and equipment used within the integrated combat system.  The COTS conversion kits will support Navy Open Architecture computing environment standards to facilitate software reuse. FY13-FY18 kits are based on a Technology Insertion - 12 (TI-12) and Technology Insertion - 12 Hybrid (TI-12H) configurations. FY16-FY21 transitions to the TI-16 configuration with procurement for shore sites starting in FY16 and procurement for ships starting in FY19.  FY21-22 transitions to the TI-22 configuration. Due to prior year budget constraints, the TI-16 hardware development, production and associated ACB-12 software migration have been delayed. In order to support critical Ship Combat System modernization installation schedules involving many other CS elements, production of the TI-12 configuration has been extended for SSDS MK 2 with technology refresh of un-procurable components (designated TI-12H).  This has impacted the FY16 and FY17 execution and FY18 plans. The budget cost estimates for the procurement and installation of the kits varies depending on the specific ship class (CVNs, LPDs, LSDs, LHAs, and LHDs), and the existing configuration of the ship or shore site. The cost estimates for individual COTS conversion kits and their associated installation costs are included in the footnotes of exhibit P3A (for UQ005B).  For FY18-FY20, (UQ005)includes procurement of Cyber Security Equipment in support of fielding of Cyber Security capabilities as part of SSDS MK-2 Ship Modernization.  In FY18, equipment will be procured for SSDS Shore Sites Integration and test of Cyber Security equipment to support Cyber Security Wholeness

The Rolling Airframe Missile is a lightweight, quick-reaction, high firepower missile system designed to provide anti-ship missile defense.  The system (MK-31 GMWS) is comprised of a MK-44 Guided Missile Round Pack (GMRP) and the MK 49 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS), which holds 21 RAM missiles.  The 21-round launcher is compatible with various platforms, ranging from large USN amphibious assault ships to Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This system is designed to counter high density anti-ship, cruise missile raids and provide for ship survivability with accurate terminal guidance, proven lethality and no fire control illumination dependence.

                    <proc:Description>Equipment procured on the P3a makes up the NSSMS Mk 57 Mod 14 (L class) systems that are planned for installation on six LHD 1 class ships.  An NSSMS Mk 57 Mod 14 system is comprised of the following:

For LHD 1, 3, 5 - (2) Transmitter Upgrades (SSTX), (2) Integrated Radar Processors (IRPs), (2) ESSM ORDALTs and (2) System Launcher Controllers (SLCs) are required for each of those ships.

For LHD 2, 4, 6  - These ships already have the SSTX ORDALT installed, so only (2) Integrated Radar Processors (IRPs), (2) ESSM ORDALTs, and (2) System Launcher Controllers (SLCs) are required for each of those ships.

Overall acquisition lead time for the Radar group is comprised of the contract award-to-delivery time of the new NSSMS components to the NSSMS depot, where these items are incorporated into existing equipment, tested, and delivered to the shipyard for ship installation.  Production lead time for SLCs and IRPs is 18 months ACA; for SSTX ORDALTS lead time is 24 months ACA.  It then takes the NSSMS depot 12 months to overhaul existing equipment and install newly procured upgrades into existing Radar group components, depending upon overall NSSMS depot workload.  The nominal timeline for delivering an upgraded NSSMS shipset to the shipyard is 36 ACA months.

ESSM Blk 2 launcher (MLU) backfit installations to CVNs and selected L class ships will occur in FY22-25.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>FY16-FY22 includes the procurement of COTS Conversion Kits  for CVNs, LPDs, LHDs, LHAs and LSDs, and COTS Upgrade Kits / field changes for the shore sites used for SSDS software development/ maintenance, training, and Combat System integration and certification testing.  SSDS procurement also includes various Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) based systems and equipment used within the integrated combat system.  The COTS conversion kits will replace obsolescent COTS hardware, will support Navy Open Architecture computing environment standards to facilitate software reuse and will support the integration of new CS elements and capabilities. FY13-FY18 kits are based on a Technology Insertion - 12 (TI-12) and Technology Insertion - 12 Hybrid (TI-12H) configurations. FY16-FY21 transitions to the TI-16 configuration with procurement for shore sites starting in FY16 and procurement for ships starting in FY19.  FY21-22 transitions to the TI-22 configuration.  The budget cost estimates for the procurement and installation of the kits varies depending on the specific ship class (CVNs, LPDs, LSDs, LHAs, and LHDs), and the existing configuration of the ship or shore site. The cost estimates for individual COTS conversion kits and their associated installation costs are included in the footnotes of exhibit P3A (for UQ005B).

[UQ5IN FMP SHIP UNITS] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cost for the ship and shore site kits vary depending on the specific ship class (CVN, LPD, LHD,LHA,LSD) and the specific shore site and the existing configuration of the ship/site involved.  The costs for each kit are listed below.  SSDS kit funding is provided to various contractors and field activities.  The SSDS equipment procurement is based on competitive, fixed price contracts.   Production lead time for kits ranges from 9 months (for equipment COTS upgrade kits/field changes) to 15 months for system COTS conversion kits for ships and shore sites.

The non-FMP kits are required for four SSDS/CS shore sites: The SSDS MK 2 System/Software Design Agent System Integration Lab, SCSC wallops Island CS Integration/Engineering test facility, NSWC Dahlgren CS software certification facility, and crew SSDS maintenance training facilities. Each of these facilities requires equipment to support the in-service ship configurations, and to support the new configuration baselines in development. The SSDS OPN UQ005 supports field changes to the in-service baselines, and the establishment of new baseline configurations at the shore sites. The cost for the kits varies significantly depending on the site, its existing configuration, and mission of the site. The FY16 procurement of non-FMP kits is mainly for TI-12/TI-12H and it includes procurement of the initial TI-16 equipment for the Design Agent System Integration lab. 

The FY17 procurement includes the completion of TI-12/TI-12H equipment for the shore sites, and completion of the TI-16 equipment procurement for the Design Agent System Integration Lab. 

The FY18 procurement includes TI-16 equipment for SCSC Wallops Island for Combat System Integration Testing and TI-16 equipment for the competitive CSEA contract for the development of the SSDS MK2 ACB-20 baseline.

            <proc:Description>The Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC) consists of Commercial and Government Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) software and COTS hardware.  TMPC provides targeting, mission planning, strike planning and execution, mission distribution, and operational employment capabilities for the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM).  Continuous TMPC software development decreases mission planning time and increases the quality and accuracy of each mission while reducing complexity.  TMPC provides mission planning at the theater and operational levels and is designed for high rate mission planning production responsive to national strategic, operational, and tactical requirements.  TMPC develops and distributes missions for the Tomahawk Missile; provides command information services for Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS); provides strike planning, execution, coordination, control and reporting, and provides Maritime Component Commanders (MCC) the capability to plan or modify conventional TLAM missions.  TMPC has evolved into scalable configurations deployed in four configurations at 186 sites: Cruise Missile Support Activities (CMSAs) (3+1 FMS), Tomahawk Strike and Mission Planning Cells (TSMPCs) (3 - C5F, C6F, C7F), Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) (19 - 10 CVN), Firing Units (FRUs) (84 Surface/55 Submarines), and fleet training sites and labs (19).  TMPC supports major joint combat operations and Overseas Contingency Operations.  TMPC was previously referred to as the Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S).     

Funds provide for systems engineering, testing, Independent Verification &amp; Validation (IV&amp;V), security accreditation, installation, site acceptance testing, user familiarization of products and hardware.  The Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Global Positioning System (GPS) capability, workflow improvements to Mission Planning, Strike Planning &amp; Execution and TWS Single System initiative are included in this line to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture, improve TCS "Kill Chain" planning and communications architecture and system effectiveness.  Also, this funding line provides for COTS/GOTS refreshment, engineering changes, software upgrades, and associated Nuclear Powered General Purpose Attack Submarine/Guided Missile Destroyer/Guided Missile Cruiser/Nuclear Aircraft Carrier (SSNs/DDGs/CGs/CVN) logistics, and infrastructure to maintain compatibility and interoperability with existing and future TMPC system configurations.

Surface and Submarine Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) is a post milestone III program executing its first major tech refresh since its 2004 IOC.  The first phase of this tech refresh partially resolves processor component obsolescence.  The final phase completes all hardware and software obsolescence efforts and will be fleet released in 2017.  TTWCS functions include: tasking validation (missile mission matching), planning of over the water routes, initialization, preparation and launch of BLK III/IV missiles, TTWCS reduced response time and increased operational flexibility through addition of Launch Platform Mission Planning (LPMP), and in-flight monitoring and control of Blk IV missiles.  Final phase efforts began in FY 2012 and consist of the completion of full TTWCS hardware technology refresh, C4I Web services interfaces and operability to be fielded in backfit firing units.  In addition, funds provided to continue TTWCS viability in TTWCS v5.6 and ensure compliance with cyber security mandates, continue to address hardware obsolescence through periodic COTS hardware refresh and periodically refresh of GOTS software to address obsolescence, support migration from 32 bit to 64 bit architecture and migrate away from legacy Ada code. Finally, it will allow reduction of system complexity and incorporation of critical software fixes.  Program options are being identified that will enable TWS integration into future platforms.  Included in those options will be changes necessary for TTWCS to ensure required functionality as the missile is modernized beginning in FY 2019.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Funding is required to continue fielding version TTWCS 5.4.0 and begin fielding of TTWCS hardware/software obsolescence updates (v5.4.0.2).  Funds also provide for integration, modernization and interoperability efforts necessary to keep pace with changes, retain capability and exploit capabilities of internal (TWS All-Up-Round missile and TTWCS) and external (Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB)), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) Integrated Backbone (DIB) compliance, Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) imagery formats and Intelligence Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) interfaces, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Global Information Grid/Internet Protocol (GIG/IP) (V)6, FORCEnet compliance systems/interfaces to the effectiveness of the TWS, into TMPC deployed configurations.  Funding supporting TTWCS is appropriately phased to complete the 1st major tech refresh since IOC in 2004.  TTWCS relies on COTS hardware that requires a constant and predictive upgrade path to meet cyber security mandates, ensure continued vendor supportability, avoid costly retrofits of fielded systems, and ensure interoperability between tightly coupled COTS software applications, operating systems, and hardware processing nodes.  Consequently, increased product improvement resources are required commencing in FY 2017 and continuing in to FY 2018 to comply with commercial hardware/software supportability mandates, obsolescence, and information assurance requirements to maintain pace with modern computing architectures.

Funding is required to initiate and continue the upgrade of unsupportable and obsolete TMPC software to ensure compliance with DoD cyber security mandates.  Funding also addresses a National Technical Means (NTM) imagery format change.  The NTM change requires TMPC upgrades to be fielded to all TLAM mission planning sites by 3QFY 2018.  The Tomahawk Weapon System cannot execute a mission successfully without the NTM imagery as it is used by TMPC for precision targeting and mission planning.  FY 2018 continues deployment of TMPC 5.0.1 to Firing Units and modernization upgrade efforts for TMPC 6.0. TMPC 6.0 includes navigation and communications improvements required to support the TWS Modernization program.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>VB011 - COMBAT SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY REFRESH / LEGACY INTEGRATION
Procures tactical control hardware upgrades to SSN688, SSN688I, SSBN, SSN 21, and SSGN Class submarines for legacy combat control systems.  These updates provide accelerated delivery of tactical capability to the fleet and bridge the gap between legacy combat control systems and AN/BYG-1.  Procures Engineering Changes (EC) and Ordnance Alterations (ORDALT) to correct fleet reported problems with legacy Combat Control System software and hardware.  Procures Weapons Launch System, Multi-tube Weapon System (MTWS) and provides support for fleet introduction of the Common Weapon Launcher (CWL) transition and integration into the TI/APB process.  Provides system engineering in support of Tactical Local Area Network (TacLAN); Information Assurance (IA); Onboard Team Trainer (OBTT); and Command, Control, Computer and Intelligence Maintenance Tool (C3IMT).

VB034 - SUBMARINE COMBAT CONTROL SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
This cost code procures hardware and software upgrades for the AN/BYG-1 system for installation on all submarine platforms.  The AN/BYG-1 is the combat control system common across all submarine platforms which incorporates tactical control, weapon control and Tactical Local Area Network (TacLAN) functions into a single procurement program.  AN/BYG-1 allows the submarine Navy to rapidly update the ship safety tactical picture, integrates the common tactical picture into the battlegroup, improves torpedo interfaces and provides tactical TOMAHAWK capability.  AN/BYG-1 systems will be continuously updated with hardware enhancements to address COTS obsolescence and capability improvements as defined by the Advanced Processor Build (APB) process.  These updates are referred to as Tech Insertion (TI) kits and are differentiated by year of development (i.e. TI10, TI12, etc).  The TI upgrades provide the baseline for all future AN/BYG-1 procurements.  In addition, this budget also provides tech insertion "kits" to update existing AN/BYG-1 platforms. The AN/BYG-1 nomenclature was adopted in FY05 and out to incorporate the addition of Virginia Class Combat Control System to a common acquisition and development strategy.  This allows for AN/BYG-1 to be the common combat control system nomenclature across all submarine platforms. Funds are for the installation of Combat Control System equipment included in the Fleet Modernization Program.

VB800 - ELECTRONIC CHARTING DISPLAY INFORMATION SYSTEM
The AN/BPS-15/16 Radar with Submarine Electronic Charting Display Information System - Navy (ECDIS-N) is installed on all U.S. Navy submarine platforms. Program responsibilities for components associated with the AN/BPS-15/16, specifically the mast, mast components and hydraulic support systems as well as the unique submarine specific navigation requirements have been transferred from Program Executive Office, Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) Above Water Sensors Directorate [Line Item Number 0670] to Program Executive Office Submarines (PEO SUB) to more closely align AN/BPS-15/16 and Submarine ECDIS-N with the other Submarine Combat Systems and address shortfalls in both radar and ECDIS-N. PEO SUB Submarine Combat and Weapons Control Program Office assumed program acquisition, contractual, financial, engineering and logistical responsibilities [under Line Item Number 5420] for submarine ECDIS-N systems that are part of the AN/BPS-15/16 Radar System in support of all baselines. This will include conducting submarine Voyage Management System (VMS) 8.3.4 and VMS 9.3 integration, testing, ECDIS-N certification, and fielding responsibilities in support of all baselines.

This is a zero sum transfer from Budget Line Item 0670, Item Number GW038 to Budget Line Item 5420, Item Number VB800.

VB995 PRODUCTION ENGINEERING AND INITIAL TRAINING - This cost code procures production and logistics support, assistance for asset management, cost analyses, preparation of contract specifications, monitoring of contract deliverables, contractor cost, schedule and performance monitoring, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) planning and Government Furnished Information (GFI) coordination.  This cost code also provides initial training curriculum development, training management materials, exercise control group development, and pilot services to the Fleet.

VB997 - SSGN SUSTAINING SUPPORT
The SSP funding provides for the procurement, installation and sustainment of equipment required for the life-cycle operational support of SSGN Attack Weapons Systems (AWS) for the four OHIO-class SSGNs. OPN sustaining support funding provides for SSGN AWS logistics acquisition support and for Attack Weapon Control System (AWCS) alterations that provide technical refresh updates to the AWCS and to two shore-based trainers located at Kings Bay, GA and Bangor, WA.  The AWCS alterations will provide technical refresh upgrades to include the Tactical TOMAHAWK Weapon Control Systems (TTWCS) 5.4.0.2 and TOMAHAWK Command and Control System (TC2S 5.0.1) software necessary to ensure the long-term safety, reliability and maintainability of the Attack Weapons Control System.  TTWCS 5.4.0.2 and TC2S 5.0.1 software are required for the SSGN Strike Operations to continue the Fleet's mission.  TTWCS 5.6 is required to maintain compatibility with modernized TOMAHAWK missiles.  The modernized TOMAHAWK supports emerging missions for which the SSGN is the prime platform for deployment.  The TTWCS updates are critical to the ability to fire Tomahawk missiles from the SSGNs.  The increase in FY18 is attributable to the support for the TTWCS 5.6 update required to maintain compatibility with modernized TOMAHAWK missiles.  The modernized TOMAHAWK supports emerging missions for which the SSGN is the prime platform for deployment.  The TTWCS updates are critical to the ability to fire Tomahawk missiles from the SSGNs.

VB700 - PAYLOAD PROCUREMENT
Procurement of COTS/GOTS payloads for integration, verification, and validation.  Beginning in FY18 UAS shipset procurements and associated integration, verification, and validation efforts.

            <proc:Description>Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Equipment procures and manufactures Navy EOD required tools and equipment in support of both OCONUS and CONUS operations that allow the ability to detect, access, diagnose, render safe, exploit, and dispose threats to National Security. Current missions now require increased standoff distances and remote means to perform operational tasks due to the increased lethality of munitions and Weapons of Mass Destruction. 

The Expeditionary Exploitation Unit (EXU-1) provides technical exploitation of IEDs and conventional ordnance to provide time sensitive, technical intelligence, tactical and operational information to EOD warfighters and National level intelligence activities. This program procures tools and equipment in support of their mission to collect, evaluate, analyze, and interpret foreign material acquisition and its relationship to the EOD community.  

Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems that disrupt enemy command and control radio frequency (RF) communications associated with IEDs is procured by this program. And, in support of JUONS CC-0558 Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS)Capabilities this program also supports the Navy effort to field reconfigured CREW dismounted systems with an initial, quick response, man-portable C-UAS capability. 

The Navy is responsible for the management and execution of the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unified procurement system as assigned by DOD Directive 5160.62.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 baseline funding will procure Navy EOD Equipment, Decision Support System (DSS) upgrades to Joint Service EOD Common Controller Platform, and DSS Production Environments, EOD Outfitting equipment,  Advanced EOD Robotics Production Engineering, Acceptance, Test &amp; Evaluation, Product Improvement of the EOD equipment;  EOD training and related support; Technical Training material used for training at the Naval School Explosive Ordnance Disposal. 

FY2018 funding is required to procure Mobile In-Country Exploitation (ICE), tools and equipment. 

Additionally, FY 2018 baseline funds will procure Combined Explosive Exploitation Cell Platoon Laboratory Table of Allowance equipment for intelligence mission is to collect, evaluate, analyze, and interpret foreign material acquisition and its relationship to the EOD community(i.e. Advanced X-Ray; Weapons Assessment tools).

In FY 2018 this program also provides for the procurement of Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems that disrupt enemy command and control radio frequency (RF) communications associated with IEDs. This includes the procurement of Joint CREW systems reconfigured to provide a Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) capability in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON), and includes initial systems supporting Naval Special Warfare C-UAS requirements.

This program also provides for the procurement of Naval Surface Warfare to provide a Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) capability in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUOU).

OCO: 
FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds support Expeditionary Exploitation Unit One (formerly TSD) supports COCOM requirements in Operation Freedom Sentinal and Operation Inherent Resolve.

FY 2018 OCO funding supports recapitalization/reset of legacy Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems/equipment currently in service, providing electronic warfare jammer protection against radio-controlled improvised explosive devices.  CREW systems disrupt enemy command and control radio frequency (RF) communications associated with IEDs.  Systems are adaptively deployed across Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) and Naval Beach Group forces as required for Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>[P40A / RA004 - QUALITY EVAL TECH &amp; EQUIPMENT (QETE)]: Provides funding to procure test systems and equipment in support of the Navy weapons systems and ordnance Quality Evaluation (QE) Program. The purpose of the Navy QE Program is to insure that only safe, quality, reliable, and ready Navy and Marine Corps weapons systems and ordnance items are provided to the Fleet. The results of the QE stock surveillance testing is technical readiness data used to predict when items degrade to the point where they become unsafe to store or would fail to function (unreliable) when needed and should be removed from service.

This generic (non-weapons systems specific) test equipment is needed to assess the effects of aging and exposure to environmental conditions on Navy weapons systems and ordnance such as mines, gun ammunition, missiles, pyrotechnics, demolition systems/devices, bombs, and torpedoes throughout the in-service portion of their life cycle and will be located at NAVSEA engineering field activities. Requirements for the test equipment come from a need to replace or modernize obsolete or economically non-repairable equipment or to acquire new or expanded generic test capabilities when new evaluation techniques or process are needed. The equipments procured by these funds are generally "one of a kind" and are used to support generic Navy weapons systems and ordnance types. Weapons systems specific equipment is procured/funded via the individual weapons system Program Management offices. After the weapon specific equipment has entered the inventory, these funds adapt the capability, if feasible, to become more generic and support more than one weapon system. This reduces the overall economic burden to the Navy.

[P40A / RA005 - FLEET MINE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT]: Mine Countermeasure Targets are used to emulate both physically and electronically Foreign mine threats for Fleet training, exercises, ranges, and platform and system validation.

            <proc:Description>The OPN 5661 line procures, installs and delivers training devices at the seven schoolhouses worldwide.  The funds support Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&amp;E) and Combat Systems training requirements, training upgrades and engineering sustainment for the Submarine Weapon Systems.  Funding includes modernization of training devices to maintain compatibility with existing fleet operational equipment and to implement Trainer Enhancement Changes (TECs) as directed by the Fleet Type Commanders and Resource Sponsor (N97).

FY18 increases in funding and requirements for the Submarine Multi-Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT) procurement / modernization was based on Fleet availabilities and Trainer alignment to increase support for VA Class Modernization, SSBN/SSGN Switchable SMMTT and Sensor Modernization tasks that were not previously funded.

Line item 5661 was broken into five functional areas to support submarine training:  Hull Mechanical &amp; Electrical Trainers (HM&amp;E), Engineering Trainers, Navigation Trainers, Combat Control Acoustic Trainers and Attack Center Trainers.

[P40A / Submarine Training]: This line provides funds to modify/upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment and to implement Training Enhancement Changes (TECs) to the trainer systems capabilities.

[P40A / HM&amp;E TRAINERS]: This line procures HM&amp;E Fleet and Team Trainer Technical Training Equipment (TTE), Training Unique Equipment (TUE) and Training Enhancement Changes (TECs), which are centrally managed systems, support equipment and various modifications and upgrades to simulators / stimulators, such as: Submarine Ship Control Operator Trainer (SCOT) and Firefighter Trainer (FFT). These modifications and upgrades were identified by the Submarine Learning Center (SLC) and approved by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) for use at the submarine training activities.  Technical Training Equipment/Training Unique Equipment sustains high fidelity training and replaces equipment beyond economical repair or procures new equipment.  Funds also procure Submarine High Risk Trainer procurement for Pressurized Submarine Escape Trainers and Damage Control Wet Trainers.

[P40A / ENGINEERING TRAINERS]: This line procures and installs Fleet Interactive Display Equipment (FIDE) trainers, Training Enhancement Changes (TECs) and other Navy Engineering Training devices as identified by the Submarine Learning Center (SLC) and approved by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) for use at the submarine training activities. FIDEs support multiple ship classes and configurations at nine different geographic sites, each requiring different levels of installation work. Therefore, the cost for the program varies widely from year to year depending on the combination of these factors.

[P40A / NAVIGATION TRAINING]: This line procures Submarine Fleet and Team Navigation trainer sustaining equipment and systems which emulate ship characteristics. Navigation training systems include, but are not limited to:  Virtual Environment Submarine (VESUB), Submarine Piloting and Navigation Trainers (SPAN), Reconfigurable SPAN (RSPAN), Submarine Bridge Trainer/Integrated SPAN (SBT/ISPAN) and associated upgrades to all Homeports, Navigation Databases, Periscope Simulation (PSIM) Harbor Databases, Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems-Navy (ECDIS-N) and PC-based Team Trainers including Mini-SPANs.  A Single Story Bridge Trainer will be procured for Homeports where an SBT Dome MILCON cannot be accommodated.  This line also provides configuration changes for the Voyage Management Systems (VMS), ECDIS-N, and the Submarine Multi Reconfigurable Training System (MRTS). The MRTS family includes VA CLASS Torpedo Room, Emergency Diesel Generator, Weapons Launch Console Team Trainer, and Submarine Communications Support System / Common Submarine Radio Room (SCSS / CSRR) trainers.  The SBT/ISPAN is comprised of Virtual Tactical, Weapons, Mission Payload and Sonar Simulation Control, Beam Forming Sonar Simulation Trainer, VMS, ECDIS-N, Radar Simulation, Navigation Aids, Periscope Simulation (PSIM), and Harbor Databases.


These systems and Training Enhancement Changes (TECs) are identified by the Submarine Learning Center (SLC) and approved by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), for use at the submarine training activities.  These systems support fleet requested updates and technical refresh of all the systems and products listed above.

[P40A / COMBAT CONTROL ACOUSTIC TRAINERS]: This line procures SUBMARINE COMMON OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS AND EMPLOYMENT TRAINER (COAET) fundamental and employment skill level as well as Sonar Employment Trainer (SET) acoustic operator employment skill and team training fleet requirements.

SUBMARINE COMMON OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS AND EMPLOYMENT TRAINERS
The COAET is an interactive, fundamental skills-level and employment skills trainer.  The purpose of these devices is to provide operator and introductory team training to submarine force personnel prior to entry into the Submarine Multi Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT).  It also provides supplemental training to off-load the heavily utilized attack center trainers.  COAET provides training utilizing partial tactical builds and emulations of the latest Sonar, Combat Control, Imaging and Electronic Warfare Systems.  These devices provide an environment substantially equivalent to that found on board ship, thus enabling students to develop and maintain the attack center expertise necessary to support Fleet operations. Also provides funding for TECs, Virtualized Tactical Control (VTAC), Beam Simulation for Sonar Trainers (BSST),Periscope Simulation (PSIM), SUBSKILLSNET, Weapons Control, Mission Payload Control, Advanced Processing Build (APB)/ Technical Insertion (TI),and Sonar Tactical Decision Aid (STDA) implementation.

SUBMARINE SONAR TRAINERS
The Sonar Employment Trainer (SET) provides acoustic operator employment Fleet and team training for submarine sonar systems.  It uses entirely commercial components to contain contact and environment models, simulations of the sensors and signal processing, simulated operator consoles, and an instructional subsystem including an instructor's console.  SET is used to train advanced operators in the Advanced Sonar Employment and Sonar Supervisor courses.  The SET is periodically upgraded to support current software Advanced Processor Builds (APBs) and Technical Insertions (TIs).  The SET is an essential component of an emerging shore based training that supports the projected technology in the Fleet systems that are designed to meet current and future acoustic threats.  The SET is part of the solution to increase operator competence and data recognition through employment training by its use of 3-D graphics, animation, audio and scientific visualization methods to illustrate highly complex displays and concepts of oceanographic physics.  The demands of curriculum and student participation at NAVSUBSCOL, Groton dictates the number and configuration of trainers provided. This trainer supports real world recorded sensors for playback in the trainer.

FY2017: Procures one kit and implements simulation upgrades to the SET as directed by the Type Commander.

[P40A / ATTACK CENTER TRAINERS]: SUBMARINE MULTI MISSION TEAM TRAINER (SMMTT) procures highly sophisticated shore based Combat System Team Trainers capable of training personnel in all aspects of submarine approach, attack and surveillance operations in a controlled, simulated environment to achieve desired submarine force readiness levels.  Also, funding is included for TECs.  

The Combat Control System (CCS) AN/BYG-1 is installed on SSN/SSBN/SSGN Class submarines and is planned for future modernizations of software and hardware to provide enhanced warfighter capabilities.  The Tactical Acoustic Rapid COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) Insertion (ARCI) AN/BQQ-10 upgrades are being installed with future revisions which provides enhanced warfighter capabilities. These CCS and ARCI upgrades to the AN/BYG1 and BQQ-10 systems in the fleet drive the modernization of the Shore Based Team Trainers.  SMMTT also includes annual Tactical Imaging/ Advanced Processor Build (TI/APB) upgrades that support multiple classes of submarines.  The Submarine Multi-Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT) supports operator, employment, strike, and Battle Group training for enlisted and officer pipelines for these systems.  The SMMTT provides operators and combat teams the opportunity to train ashore prior to and between deployments.  The shore based training provides a means of maintaining team proficiency prior to ship deployment. SMMTT is also used for SSN/SSGN crew certification.  The use of Open Architecture (OA) trainer systems allows for the continuous growth of functional flexibility ultimately leading to employment training conducted for any submarine combat system.   Plans are established to likewise upgrade submarine tactical systems to an OA, and the trainers will be compatible with the tactical interfaces. This program includes modifications to the functionality of the Periscope Simulator (PSIM) to provide common imaging training for CCS trainers and includes Electronic Surveillance Simulation Software.  Recent and tactical CCS change the interfaces for the software updates to the navigation submarine trainers.  This trainer supports real world recorded sensors for playback in the trainer.

Three Legacy SMMTT trainers support the SSBN Crew Certification and pre-deployment training as required by the Type Commander.  One LSMMTT trainer supports SSNs that have not been modernized in the TI/APB process including SSN 774 class submarines.  LSMMTT is a combination of tactical combat controls and sonar systems driven by simulation/stimulation devices and leverages additional trainer simulation/auxiliary ship systems.  

FY2017: Procures 3 Phase III Modifications (MOD) for SSN and 3 SSN/SSBN MODS for Strategic Forces.

                    <proc:Description>SMMTT upgrades to hardware and simulation to match current Fleet configurations.

[SMMTT PHIII MODS] SMMTT upgrades to hardware and simulation to match current Fleet configurations.  FY2017, FY2018, FY2021, and FY2022 are hardware procurements.  

Unit costs are significantly higher in FY2018 due to additional Trainer Enhancement requirements directed by the TYCOM. The requirements include, but are not limited to Low Cost Conformal Array (LCCA) updates, All World
Environmental Simulator (AWESIM) tech refresh, and Periscope Simulators (PSIM). Also included are the Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) procurements, system procurements of Touchscreens
displays across various sites, and updates to the Torpedo Relevancy Model (TRM).</proc:Description>

This budget activity is coordinated by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

This line also provides funds to modify/upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment and to implement Training Enhancement Changes (TECs) to the trainer systems capabilities.

[P40A / TD002: SUBMARINE TRAINING DEVICE MODS]: Provides funding for modifications which are upgrades to submarine training systems and TECs which are centrally managed systems. These improvements/upgrades are required to keep training systems, such as the Ship Control Operator Trainer (SCOT) and Submarine Bridge Trainer (SBT), compatible with equivalent changes made to fleet operational equipment and to change trainer capabilities to meet emergent training requirements.

[P40A / TD006: SUB COAET]: TD006 SUBMARINE COMMON OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS AND EMPLOYMENT TRAINER  (COAET)The COAET is an interactive, fundamental skills-level and employment skills trainer.  It  allows for introduction of new fleet requirements and upgrades. The purpose of these devices is to provide operator and  introductory team training to submarine force personnel prior to entry into the full-up Submarine Multi Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT).  It also provides supplemental training to off-load the heavily utilized attack center trainers.  COAET provides training utilizing partial tactical builds and emulations of the latest Sonar and Combat Control Systems.  These devices provide an environment substantially equivalent to that found on board ship, thus enabling students to develop and maintain the attack center expertise necessary to support Fleet operations. Also provides funding for TECs, integration of Virtualized Tactical Control (VTAC), Advanced Processing Build (APB)/ Technical Insertion (TI), and Sonar Tactical Decision Aid (STDA) implementation.

[P40A / TD009: SMMTT PH3]: TD009 SUBMARINE MULTI MISSION TEAM TRAINER (SMMTT)To achieve desired submarine force readiness levels, it is necessary to construct highly sophisticated shore based Combat System Team Trainers capable of training personnel in all aspects of submarine approach, attack and surveillance operations in a controlled, simulated environment.  Includes funding for TECs.
The Combat Control System (CCS) AN/BYG-1 is installed on SSN/SSBN/SSGN Class submarines, and there are currently plans to further upgrade these systems with the hardware revisions which provide enhanced warfighter capabilities.  The Tactical Acoustic Rapid COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) Insertion (ARCI) AN/BQQ-10 phased upgrades are being installed with the next revision which provides enhanced warfighter capabilities. These CCS and ARCI upgrades to the AN/BYG1 and BQQ-10 systems directly impact shore based Team Trainers.  SMMTT also includes annual Tactical Imaging TI/APB upgrades that support multiple classes of submarines. The Submarine Multi-Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT) supports operator, employment and training for enlisted and officer pipelines for these systems.  The SMMTT provides operators and combat teams the ability to train ashore, prior to, and between deployments.  The shore based training provides a means of maintaining team proficiency prior to ship deployment. SMMTT is also used for SSN/SSGN crew certification.  SMMTT replaced all Military (MIL) Standard hardware in previous systems with commercial emulation hardware, enabling platform independence and wide area network capability.  The use of Open Architecture (OA) trainer systems allows for the continuous growth of functional flexibility ultimately leading to employment training conducted for any submarine combat system.   Plans are established to likewise upgrade submarine  tactical systems to an OA, and the trainers will be compatible with the tactical interfaces. This program includes modifications to the functionality of the Periscope Simulator (PSIM) to provide common imaging training for CCS trainers and includes Electronic Surveillance Simulation Software.  Recent tactical CCS change the interfaces for the software updates to the navigation submarine trainers.

SMMTT is also used for SSGN crew certification prior to crew flyaway for crew swapout.  The use of Open Architecture (OA) trainer systems allows for the continuous growth of functional flexibility ultimately leading to employment training conducted for any submarine combat system.          .
Legacy SMMTT supports SSBN Crew Certification and predeployment training as required by the Type Commander.  LSMMTT also supports SSNs that have not been modernized in the TI/APB process including SSN 774 class submarines.  LSMMTT is a combination of tactical combat controls in sonar systems driven by simulation/stimulation devices and leverages additional trainer simulation/auxiliary ship systems.  

FY16 procures 4 items:  Procures one SSBN SMMTT Mod EDM, one SMMTT EPM updates to match the latest Fleet tactical build for SSNs and unique sensors; procures two SMMTT kit upgrades to appropriate APB and TI.

            <proc:Description>Note: Efforts within this budget line were consolidated from BLI's 1320, 2762, and 5662 in FY16 and prior.

This line provides funding to procure, modify, and upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment.  Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and Fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan.

[P40A / LCS SEAFRAME SIMULATORS]: Funds procure Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) training simulators and equipment for the respective LCS homeports and the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) in Newport, Rhode Island. Simulators are needed to meet the Train to Qualify Train to Certify  (T2Q/T2C) Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement of the Capabilities Development Document. Funding procures hardware and software associated with building the trainers and the installation of this hardware and software at the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) in each homeport and at SWOS. Trainers are required for each ship variant, with initial procurements for the San Diego homeport and SWOS, followed by procurements for the Mayport homeport within the FYDP. Throughput of LCS crews requires more than one simulator of each variant in a homeport.

1.1) LCS Virtual Reality Labs &amp; Networks - Funds comprehensive network infrastructure and computing environment and Virtual Reality Labs (VRLs), within the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) to support delivery and management of all components of LCS Training. Without the VSTS network infrastructure, no systems within the LTF (currently being built in San Diego, and funded for Mayport) will interoperate or communicate with each other.  Both LTFs are being built and designed around a central computer server farm that houses all courseware, training scenarios, and student records.  Without the network infrastructure, there is no way to distribute the required courseware and software around the LTF, making the building essentially unusable.  Without the VRLs, there is no method of presenting previously developed Immersive Virtual Ship Environment (IVSE) courseware to students. Modernization efforts include regular/scheduled updates/upgrades to VSTS and include procurement of new servers, relays, and switches, along with the procurement of replacement Virtual Reality Lab (electronic classroom) equipment.

1.2) LCS Mission Bay Trainers &amp; Modernization - Enable the qualification, training, and team certification of the individuals and teams working in the Mission Bay.  Scenarios include prepping and launching/recovering of mission module off-hull remote vehicles and operating of the cranes, doors, and other associated equipment in the Mission Bay.  They include full-scale replicas of the Mission Bay for both variants.  Without the Mission Bay Trainer, there will be no homeport training in the Mission Bay operations for the San Diego or Mayport-based crews and detachments during training pipeline, or off-hull, rapid refresh crew team training, and the primary warfare area (the Mission Bay) for the LCS ships will have no shore-based, controlled training capability in San Diego and Mayport, in this high-risk area of Mission Bay operations.  

1.3 &amp; 1.4) LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers &amp; ITT Modernization - These are full scale simulators and/or stimulations of Tactical Software enabling integrated team training of Bridge, Combat Systems, Engineering, and Mission Package systems/watch stations. The quantity and type (based on variant) of trainers in San Diego and Mayport is dependent on the Navy's Strategic Laydown of the Littoral Combat Ships.  Follow on ITT procurements (FY16 and follow) will include integrated crew served weapon simulators (discussed below).  If the ITTs are not funded, there is no way for the LCS crews and detachments to train in-port, as the LCS ships do not have an onboard training system.  Without the shore-based trainers, the ships must get underway, and use real targets and Fleet assets, such as drones, and training aircraft for all of their training.  The LCS Concept of Operations does not support such at-sea intensive training requirements.  Modernization efforts include regular/scheduled updates and upgrades to the ITTs and include procurement of new servers, relays, and switches, as well as new consoles, joy sticks and communication equipment. IAW draft maturing Life Cycle Sustainment Plan for Trainers, Integrated Tactical Trainers (ITTs) require first upgrade to keep current with changing ship configurations five years after delivery of the trainer, and every two years after  FY18 provides the second installment of funding for the INDEPENDENCE ITT in San Diego. 

1.5 &amp; 1.6)  Bridge Trainers - Devices that permit selected aspects of Bridge tasks (including Readiness Control Officer [RCO] tasks) to be practiced independently of Combat Systems Operations as found in more capable ITTs. This facilitates more efficient accomplishment of T2Q and T2C objectives. This trainer supports Officer training pipeline at SWOS, Newport in support of Division Officer, Department Head, and PXO/PCO training pipeline for Officer of the Deck Training and rapid refresh and skills enhancement in Mayport.

1.7) Crew Served Weapons Simulators - Funds support tactical deployment of small arms weapons stations topside. Crew Served weapons simulators will be integrated into procurement of follow-on ITTs. Without these simulators installed and integrated with the Integrated Tactical Trainers, the crew's tactical teams have no way to exercise ashore their Surface Warfare Detect-to-Engage sequence. The LCS ships are built to operate close to land. Proper execution and employment of their small arms (.50 Cal) are critical to the safety of the ship, and her crew.

1.8) Combat Systems Part Task Trainers (C2 PTT) (LCS 1 and LCS 2) .  These devices permit training in selected aspects of Combat Systems Operations that are found in the more capable ITTs, to support individual skills development and practice, reduce the wear and tear on the ITTs, and allow the ITTs to more efficiently accommodate team training and certifications.

[P40A / LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers &amp; ITT Modernization]: In accordance with draft maturing Life Cycle Sustainment Plan for Trainers, Integrated Tactical Trainers (ITTs) require first upgrade to keep current with changing ship configurations five years after delivery of the trainer, and every two years after.  This provides the second installment of funding for the INDEPENDENCE ITT in San Diego.

[P40A / MB040 - BFTT SHIP SETS]: Note: FY16 BFTT Ship Set Procurements are installed in FY17. The procurements costs are shown in FY16 in the BLI 2762 budget.

[P40A / CVN 78 Class Training Equipment]: This provides for several initiatives oriented to developing the formal life cycle training solutions for multiple mission critical CVN 78 contractor furnished equipment (CFE) systems. Funds procure CVN 78 Class training simulators and equipment for the applicable Navy Education and Training Command Centers of Excellence to achieve Ready For Training (RFT). In particular, the CFE items procured include: training simulators, ship system mock-ups, electronic classrooms, intelligent tutoring systems, and all engineering and facilities upgrades necessary for installation at the training facilities. Simulators are needed to meet warfighter mission and safety readiness requirements of the Naval Aviation Carrier Training Manual. Funding procures hardware and software associated with building the trainers' hardware and software for future installation at the applicable Centers of Excellence in Norfolk, Great Lakes, and at SWOS Newport.

                    <proc:Description>The Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT)/Advanced Training Domain (ATD)/Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) family of systems provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict; realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas; a means to link ships together which are in different homeports for coordinated training; external stimulation of shipboard training systems; and simulation of non-shipboard forces. TSTC/ATD/BFTT uses a distributed architecture, integrating existing training systems, and uses Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) protocols. TSTC/ATD/BFTT provides ships' Commanding Officers and Strike Group/Battle Force (SG/BF) Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Groups (ATGs), the Tactical Training Groups and C2F/C3F Fleet Synthetic Training (FSTs)/Live Virtual Constuctive (LVC) exercises. The Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) integrates existing and emergent onboard training and assessment system capabilities to simulate realistic, "train like you fight", combat-like conditions across weapon sensor and combat systems. Migration to TSTC improvements is required to ensure continued, persistent FST/LVC interoperability to deliver training that is commensurate with tactical capabilities. Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Obsolescence mitigates replacement and upgrade of obsolete and out-of-production COTS components in BFTT systems installed throughout the Fleet to include the AN/USQ-T46D upgrade. BFTT T46D and ATD/T52 are core components of the TSTC.

BFTT T46D Ship set configurations vary depending on AEGIS or SSDS installation.  T46D's for SSDS include additional materials and units to be integrated for stimulation of the ships sensors.

FY17 - TSTC/BFTT Ship Set funding will procure (19) T46D's and subsequent variants of hardware and software Build 5.x series in support of AN/SQQ-89 upgrades, AEGIS Baseline 9 upgrades and SSDS upgrades. Installation funding supports installation of (11) BFTT AN/USQ-T46D Systems.

FY18 - TSTC/ATD/BFTT Ship Set funding will procure (9) T46D's and (2) T52's and subsequent variants of hardware and software Build 5.x series in support of AN/SQQ-89 upgrades, and ATD software builds in support of AEGIS Baseline 9 TI-16 upgrades and SSDS upgrades -- which drives the difference in unit cost. Installation funding supports installation of (19) BFTT AN/USQ-T46D Systems.  Additional costs will be incurred to procure more materials needed to meet cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with NCTE to meet shipboard integrated training demands.

Increased materials and quantities installed in FY18 are required to meet cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with NCTE to meet shipboard integrated training demands.</proc:Description>

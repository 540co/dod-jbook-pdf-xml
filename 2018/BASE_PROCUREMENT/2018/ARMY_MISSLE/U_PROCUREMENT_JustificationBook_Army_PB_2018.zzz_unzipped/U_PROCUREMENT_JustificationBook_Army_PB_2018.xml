            <proc:Description>The Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense (AMD) supports the Field Surveillance Program (FSP), PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC), International Engineering Services Program (IESP), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), US Unique ES, and System Engineering Program Management (SEPM) activities. The mission of the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Field Surveillance Program (FSP) is required to ensure that the reliability, performance, and safety of fielded PAC-3 missiles remain within the classified system specification for the life of the system.  Initial FSP tasks confirmed the quality of design, materials, procedures, and processes used in the manufacture of the system.  After missile deployment, results from surveillance firings, inspections, functional tests, Storage and Aging Programs, and depot level missile maintenance processing provide the data required for the assessment of reliability, performance, and safety of the missile stockpile. This includes PAC-3 missile tooling and test equipment. The PAC-3 missile is fielded under the Certified Round Concept.  Under this approved concept, the PAC-3 missile is capable of being placed in extended storage as part of war reserve stocks or deployed in operational units for variable periods and then fired without intervening tests or checkouts.  In accordance with the Certified Round Concept, the reliability/performance of the missile is certified by the Lower Tier Project Office (LTPO) to be at an acceptable level for a stated period of time or corrective action is taken.

The certification of reliability is made possible through the use of the PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC) contract to use technical support and knowledge of the testing of discrete lots of component parts, subassemblies and assemblies which the prime contractor Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) provides as the only source of technical knowledge, expertise, and facilities to perform FSP activities and process PAC-3 missiles.

The PATRIOT International Engineering Services Program provides continuing engineering support for system software and hardware for the life of the PATRIOT Air Defense System for US and international partners. The Engineering Services Program is designed to sustain, maintain, and improve the PATRIOT system within the performance envelope described in the system specification. The support provided under this program includes PATRIOT software maintenance, Post Deployment Build 8/8.x(PDB-8/8.x), engineering support for PATRIOT peculiar hardware, government furnished equipment, logistics, technical data package, trainers, and integrated diagnostics support system. This is accomplished through the investigation, analysis, and development of solutions to identified problems. Modifications to hardware are engineered for manufacturing implementation and retrofit of fielded hardware through the modification process. The Dismounted Patriot Information Coordination Central (D-PICC) effort is an example of rehosting tactical Patriot software maintained via engineering services to a smaller, more mobile hardware configuration that will allow flexible, tailorable deployment options by freeing up Battalion level ICC's.

Systems Engineering and Project Management support encompasses the overall planning, management, and control of the PATRIOT Weapon System.  Includes all Engineering and Program Management disciples and activities.

Logistics Recurring includes all aspects of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) management, e.g., maintenance support, facilities, personnel, training, testing, and fielding.

Funding provides authority to procure, field and support materiel solutions to counter cybersecurity and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Patriot Air Defense Weapon System.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 base procurement dollars in the amount of $140.826 million supports the Field Surveillance Program (FSP), PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC), International Engineering Services Program (IESP), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and System Engineering Program Management (SEPM) activities.

Funds in the program were realigned in FY2015 from C53101 (MSE) to reflect those requirements that are not unique to MSE.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missile evolved from the PATRIOT Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) missile.  The MSE is based on the PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) missile design and improves on it for a higher performance, dual pulse, eleven-inch diameter Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) design, improved lethality enhancer, thermally hardened front end for longer fly out, upgraded batteries, enlarged fixed fins, more responsive control surfaces, and upgraded guidance software.  These improvements provide a more agile, lethal interceptor missile and coupled with critical ground system improvements (Radar Digital Processor (RDP) and Software) to provide a substantial missile performance improvement while enhancing Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance.  A more IM compliant propellant for the SRM was developed for the MSE program as well as a less sensitive Lethality Enhancer.  A single canister design provides enhanced warfighter and logistics flexibility, and facilitates IM compliance for greater warfighter safety. The MSE was developed to integrate with the PATRIOT system for the U.S. and international partners.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY 2018 base procurement dollars in the amount of $459.040 million supports the production of 93 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles, Launcher Mod Kits (LMK), Field Surveillance Program (FSP), supporting equipment, ancillary missile items, PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC) and Obsolescence, System Engineering/Program Management (SE/PM), and support.

Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 3376.

*Unit prices reflect an assessed yearly FMS procurement of PAC-3 missile variants. In the event FMS procurements do not occur at this level, the budgeted missile unit price may not be achievable.

**Quantities will be procured at an optimized rate utilizing price advantage created through contract negotiation, FPIF contract ceiling liability reduction through price determination, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales (FMS) to increase the Army procurement of MSE Missiles.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program supports the overall integrated Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and provides a robust intercept capability against Cruise Missiles (CM) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).  

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat the UAS, CM, and RAM threats.  The system will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of fire control software and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM defeat mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The HELLFIRE II and Longbow family of air-to-ground missiles (all variants) provide attack helicopters and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with point-target precision strike capability to defeat heavy, advanced armor, individual hard point and non-traditional targets. HELLFIRE II Missiles use a semi-active laser terminal guidance and are the primary armaments of the AH-64 Apache, OH-58 Kiowa Warrior, Army UAS and Special Operations aircraft.  The HELLFIRE II includes Electro-Optical Countermeasure capability, warhead improvements and an updated electronic fuze. The AGM-114R HELLFIRE II family of missiles will replace all other HELLFIRE II missile configurations (K/N/M/P) except HELLFIRE Longbow. HELLFIRE II procurement funding supports the entire HELLFIRE II and HELLFIRE Longbow systems to include resolution of obsolescence, safety, insensitive munitions, reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes, facilitization, and production issues. This missile is compatible on all current force UAS and rotary wing platforms.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $94.790 million support the procurement of 998 HELLFIRE II missiles, Production Engineering Support, Project Management Administration and Engineering Services funding to include obsolescence and facilitization.

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $278.073 million supports the procurement of 2,927 HELLFIRE II missiles in order to replace and replenish missiles expended in wartime operations. OCO funding also covers Production Engineering Support, Project Management Administration, Engineering Services and fielding.
    
The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement and/or Foreign Military sales (FMS) to increase the Army procurement of HELLFIRE II missiles.

The historical Army Acquisition Objective was 34,292.

The production unit cost is based on all Services' base and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) quantity requirements known at this time.  Above quantities are Army only. Total quantities include procurement by US Air Force, US Navy, US Army and FMS cases. All procurement of Hellfire II AGM-114R missiles are reflected on the P21.

See Exhibit P-5 for Unit Cost.  Unit cost may change based on quantities procured by all Services and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  

Based on contract structure all customers pay the same Unit Cost for the same configuration.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>
                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>Yearly Minimum Sustainment Rate (MSR) = 1200 missiles.  Yearly Economical Production Rate (1-8-5) = 3600 missiles.  Yearly Maximum Production Rate (MPR) = 8500 missiles.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) program is an Army led, Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1C Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) with joint interest with the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and U.S. Navy. The JAGM is the next generation of aviation-launched, fire and forget missiles to replace all variants of HELLFIRE. The JAGM multi-mode Guidance Section is integrated with the combat proven HELLFIRE II (AGM-114R) propulsion, warhead and control section. JAGM will be used by joint service aircraft for destruction of high value stationary, moving, and relocatable land and maritime targets from standoff range in day, night, adverse weather, and obscured battlefield conditions. The program’s threshold platforms are the U.S. Army AH-64E Apache and USMC AH-1Z.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $215.532 million supports the procurement of 824 missiles. 
The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations and/or other service procurement to increase the Army procurement of JAGM missiles. 
The JAGM Product Office is the procurement agent for all services.
The Army Acquisition Objective is 20,303.

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>FY 2017:
- EMD LRIP 1 Option Award date changed from September 2017 to May 2018 due to the delay of JAGM Milestone C from 4QFY 2017 to 3QFY 2018 as a result of hardware delays.

FY 2018:
-  EMD LRIP 2 Option Award procures 824 FY 2018 missiles. The initial 496 LRIP 2 missiles will be procured with the support of FY 2017 advance procurement (AP) for long lead items. The remaining 328 LRIP 2 missiles will be procured without the use of AP for long lead items.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>
                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>In order to eliminate the need for advance procurement beyond LRIP 2, FY 2018 missile procurement (824 All Up Rounds) will be procured on two separate contact actions, both to be awarded in 3rd Quarter, FY 2018. The LRIP 2 Option Award procures 824 FY 2018 missiles. The initial 496 LRIP 2 missiles will be procured with the support of FY 2017 advance procurement (AP) for long lead items. The remaining 328 LRIP 2 missiles will be procured without the use of AP for long lead items.The LRIP 2 contract actions will be awarded as contract modifications to the existing contact, so the delivery period will be 24 months instead of 12. This will be a one-time deviation from the 12-month funded delivery period, defined as “a 12-month period that begins when the contractor delivers the first item of a fiscal year procurement" to eliminate the need for AP. Eliminating AP allows the program to: transition to a regular procurement cycle, mitigate the risk of a production gap between LRIP and FRP, aligns the Army and Navy production plans, and supports the combining of the HELLFIRE and JAGM procurements into a single contract by FY 2022.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>Javelin provides the United States Army and United States Marine Corps (USMC) a man-portable, fire-and-forget, medium-range missile with enhanced situational awareness and precision direct-fire effects to defeat armored vehicles, fortifications, and soft targets in a range of military operations.  Javelin has a high kill rate against a variety of targets at extended ranges under day/night, battlefield obscurants, adverse weather and multiple counter-measure conditions.  The system's soft launch feature permits firing from a fighting position or an enclosure.  Javelin uses a modular design to allow the system to evolve to meet changing threats and requirements via both software and hardware upgrades.  The system consists of a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a built-in-test (BIT), and a modular missile encased in a disposable launch tube assembly.  The system also includes training devices for tactical training and classroom training.  Javelin's fire-and-forget technology allows the gunner to fire and immediately take cover, to move to another fighting position, or to reload.   The Javelin provides enhanced lethality through the use of a tandem multi-purpose warhead which will defeat all known armor threats.  It is effective against both stationary and moving targets.  This system also provides defensive capability against attacking/hovering helicopters.  In current conflicts the CLU is being used as a stand-alone surveillance and target acquisition asset.  The Army is the lead for this joint program with the USMC.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $110.123 million support the procurement of 525 Missiles.

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $8.112 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Reassurance Initiative.  The procurement includes 47 missiles.

The estimated missile unit prices are based on combined United States Army, other services, and FMS procurements of 850 missiles per year.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales to increase the Army procurement of Javelin missiles and/or implement a cost reduction Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) for G-Model missile.

Beginning in FY20, G-Model missiles will be produced.

Other procurement funding (SSN H06103 Javelin Lightweight Command Launch Unit (CLU)) will begin in FY21 for procurement of Lightweight CLUs for the Javelin program.
 - FY 2021 Base procurement dollars (SSN H06103) in the amount of $30.000M support the procurement of 59 Lightweight CLUs.
 - FY 2022 Base procurement dollars (SSN H06103) in the amount of $45.000M support the procurement of 88 Lightweight CLUs.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>TOW missiles (BGM-71 Series) are combat proven missiles that provide heavy anti-armor/assault capability to the Army's Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT), the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and the Bradley equipped Armor Brigade Combat Team (ABCT). TOW continues to be used consistently as the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements.  TOW missiles are the primary heavy anti-armor / assault missile for the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and 43 allied nations.  Warfighters employ TOW missiles against buildings and field fortifications taking advantage of the missile's inherent precise assault capability against such targets.	
												
TOW missiles are launched from a variety of combat systems in the active Army and Army National Guard including the Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS), all infantry and cavalry variants of Bradley Fighting Vehicle Systems (BFVS), the Stryker Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) Light Armored Vehicle (LAV), and the M220A2 TOW 2 launcher.  The USMC employs the TOW missile from its ITAS launchers, ATGM, and AH-1W Cobra helicopters.  The TOW missile provides the warfighter with a highly lethal, cost effective, interoperable, multi-purpose weapon.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $105.8 million supports the second year of a five-year (FY17-21) multi-year contract.

            <proc:Description>Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges. The U.S. Marine Corps also procures GMLRS rockets through the Army project office.  

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments.  GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) was the first increment.  It is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is the second increment that utilizes a 200-pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage.  GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) was developed as a non-cluster munition replacement to GMLRS DPICM.  The Program completed the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and entered full rate production in FY15.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $554.998 million support the acquisition of 4,458 GMLRS rockets for the United States Army. Army Procurement Objective is 43,560.  In addition, Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.491 million support the acquisition of equipment and support to ensure Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Common Training Device alignment with the production configuration.

FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $39.693 million support the requirement for facilitization that would ramp up production to a maximum capacity of 10,000 rockets in the 4th Qtr FY2020 timeframe.    

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $191.522 million support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).  The procurements include 1,542 GMLRS rockets.

All funding goes to the Active Component. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>Lockheed Martin is currently the industry source that is both facilitized and qualified to produce the GMLRS rocket.

*Sole Source/Fixed Price Incentive Firm
**Aviation and Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>
                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>Production of GMLRS varies as this program shares a production line with Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rockets (LCRRPR). There are no production gaps during months that GMLRS are not being produced as LCRRPR Rocket production continues. GMLRS and LCRRPR synergized production efforts result in a decreased unit cost for both programs. An established organic industrial base is in place to perform download/demate of M26 rocket pods to support production efforts for both programs.To account for FY18 US Army, Marine Corps, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) deliveries, the maximum production rate was adjusted from 500 per month to 600 per month.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rocket (LCRRPR) is the only live training rocket for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and M270/M270A1 MLRS Launcher units/crews.  LCRRPR meets a critical validated requirement for Active and National Guard HIMARS and M270A1 launcher units to achieve and maintain combat readiness.  HIMARS and M270A1 Battalions are organic and attached to modular Fires Brigades supporting Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint Expeditionary Force, and Joint Special Operations Force combatant commanders.  The training rocket has an inert payload section and blunt nose for inducing reduced range for use at multiple facilities in the United States and foreign countries.  

LCRRPRs are manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas and Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC) in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.  LEMC provides an organic dual source.  The LCRRPR program includes the cost to Download/Demate (DL/DM) the M26 pod and rocket motor for production reuse.  Total cost also includes Bunker Storage and the procurement of Performance Oriented Package (POP) boxes.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $28.321 million support the procurement of 3,420 LCRRPRs which are required to maintain the practice rocket inventory for Standards in Training Commission (STRC) requirements.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>Production of Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rockets (LCRRPRs) varies as this program shares a production line with Guide Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS).  There are no production gaps during months that LCRRPRs are not being produced as GMLRS Rocket production continues.  Continued production of LCRRPRs at Camden, Arkansas mitigates shared production costs with GMLRS and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counter-fire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.

Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 363 HIMARS launchers.  The European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) will increase this AAO by 32 launchers.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $41.000 million support Non-Recurring Engineering requirements associated with common obsolescence mitigation of the HIMARS and MLRS launchers.  These activities are required to re-enable production for the requirements of a 32 HIMARS and 32 MLRS launcher European Reassurance Initiative (ERI)-driven Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) increase per launcher variant.  All Fire Control System (FCS) design obsolescence will be addressed, and the HIMARS supply chain will be assessed in preparation for HIMARS production line restart in FY2019.  The long-term FCS hardware architecture will address M-Code incorporation to comply with public law and fully enable a common FCS capability across both the HIMARS and MLRS launcher fleets upon FCS upgrade.  Completion of these activities will induce significant long-term cost savings in sustainment of the launcher fleets given the FY17 Army decision to extend the operational life of HIMARS and MLRS beyond FY2050. This represents an approximate 20 year increase in the operational service life.

            <proc:Description>Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) is a single man-portable/operable, light-weight organic, beyond line-of-sight, precision guided, loitering aerial missile system capable of locating and engaging obscured and/or fleeting enemy targets who otherwise cannot be engaged by typical direct fire weapon systems.  Front and Side Look High Resolution Electro-Optical (day) and Front Look Infrared (night) cameras allow the Warfighter to have “eyes on” the target for positive identification.  LMAMS’ Wave-Off capability allows the operator to wave-off or re-direct the LMAMS flight path up to seconds prior to impact if necessary.  The system is comprised of a fire control unit, launcher, missile, and a modular payload capable of high lethality against unprotected Combatant Personnel and Fractional Casualty against Personnel in Soft Skinned Vehicles.  Pre-flight Component Assembly and Storage allows operation within a matter of minutes. 

LMAMS Procurement Quantity is the number of All Up Rounds (AUR) to be procured in the fiscal year.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The PATRIOT Mods program implements critical capability, readiness and sustainability modifications to the weapon system and maintains Integrated Logistics Support.  Required modifications are identified through various means to include:  validated requirement documents such as the Capability Production Document (CPD), Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and the Operational Needs Statement (ONS); material changes supported by improved operational effectiveness as identified in the PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP); material deficiencies identified in the field; obsolescence issues; emerging technologies; software improvements; crew interface and communication upgrades. 
 
PATRIOT Mods funding supports Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) Mods; Recapitalization (RECAP); Battery Command Post/ Tactical Command System /Computer Software Module (BCP/TCS/CSM) Mod; the Combined Crypto Modification Phase I (CCMPI) upgrade; the Radar Digital Processor-Configuration (RDP-C) upgrade; the Air Defense Artillery (ADA) School Upgrades/ Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS); PATRIOT Maintenance Trainer (PMT); PATRIOT Multi-Echelon Training (PMET); Reconfigurable Table Top Trainers (RT3); Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Test Detachment; the Modern Manstation (MMS) upgrade; Enhanced Launcher Electronic Systems (ELES); SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO), Digital Sidelobe Canceller (DSLC), and Command Obsolescence Alleviation.

RAM modifications provide resolution to field failures which are identified through component analysis, field data collection, obsolescence issues and emerging technologies which are prioritized based on readiness and Operations and Support (O&amp;S) impacts.  This effort includes the engineering, acquisition, qualification testing, installation, technical support and training device upgrades associated with modification and design changes which are essential to stabilize the system at the highest readiness posture available and reduction of O&amp;S.  Kit quantity is based on expected Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to be applied to Major End Items (MEIs).  Quantities will be procured at an optimized rate utilizing price advantage created through contract negotiation, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales into a buy-to-budget procurement strategy. 
 
Recapitalization (RECAP) Modifications include critical upgrades including but not limited to:  Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and Depot Maintenance Plant Equipment (DMPE), Harmonic Generator Kits, Post Deployment Build 8 (PDB-8) S/W &amp; H/W, Cryptographic Modernization Kits, Modern Man Station (MMS), Antenna Mast Group (AMG) Cable upgrades, Electronic Power Plant (EPP) C3 Power Distribution Unit (PDU) kits, Information and Coordination Central (ICC) External Time Reference (ETR) kits, and Cooling Liquid Electron Tube (CLET) kits.  These modifications are synchronized within the RECAP program. RECAP is a battalion set, resulting in a more supportable, reliable, and capable unit in the force. Quantity represents 1 battalion a year.  

The Battery Command Post/Tactical Command System/Computer Software Module (BCP/TCS/CSM) effort continues the development of the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) required Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) capability to maintain compatibility with tactical software enhancements, while enhancing and improving the defense design and planning capabilities for the PATRIOT warfighter.  This includes systems engineering, software requirements, software design/code/test and independent validation and verification testing.  This effort also provides Integrated Logistics Support, required due to the large amount of Commercial Off The Shelf components, of the 62 Battery Command Posts and 17 Tactical Command Systems.  Additionally, this effort supports the BCP/TCS/CSM fielding upgrades for each PATRIOT Post Deployment Build updates.  Note: Quantities procured and installed in prior years.

Combined Crypto Modification Phase I (CCMPI):  The planned PATRIOT communications upgrade program is a phased approach leveraging National Security Agency (NSA) mandated crypto updates, user generated requirements, (PATRIOT Data Information Link (PADIL) over IP), Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications, and communications hardware obsolescence mitigation efforts. This approach allows cost efficiencies and better business practices by synergizing these efforts.  CCMPI is fully funded and addresses the PAC-3 Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements including the crypto modernization, a limited PADIL over Internet Protocol (IP) capability, and 3011C multi-cast (protocol).  CCMPI installs a Black Station Clock Upgrade (BSCU) to allow for increased data rates; the Ruggedized iQ1000 (RiQ) for data processing and IP overlay; and interfaces for soldier provided SIPR/NIPR devices.  The CCMPI program also replaces KG-94A/194A encryptors with KIV-7M encryptors.

The Radar Digital Processor-Configuration (RDP-C) replaces obsolete digital processors with single rack commercial off-the-shelf based modern processors.  Battery Replaceable Units (BRUs) are reduced from 759 to 56 with 13 power supplies and 18 racks removed.  Benefits of the RDP-C include improvement in radar reliability, life cycle cost savings, and capability and growth potential through software improvements.  The RDP-C modification will enable full AN/TPX-57(v)1 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Level 1 and 2 and new Combat Identification capabilities.  The enhanced IFF capability allows for expanded target reports from the AN/TPX-57 which will include:  National Origin, Platform ID Number (PIN), and GPS position (Level 2).  The RDP-C is a prerequisite for migration to an IAMD Netted Sensor.  The RDP-C will support efforts to counter emerging threats and growth to the netted sensor concept.  This effort includes funding for kits and some spares.

The Air Defense Artillery (ADA) School Upgrades/Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) modification is necessary to upgrade school assets to Configuration 3.  Four Radar Kits will complete the school upgrades.   

The PATRIOT Weapons System uses tactical equipment and training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS) to conduct multi-level training for both operators and maintenance personnel. This includes both hardware devices and software programs utilized to include; the Patriot Maintenance Trainer (PMT), Reconfigurable Table Top Trainer (RT3) and the Patriot Multi-Echelon Training (PMET). The PMT is a new device being developed and planned for fielding to the Air Defense Artillery Schools at Fort Sill, OK.  The PMT trains 14E, 140E, 14T, 94S and 948D 6D tasks.  It reduces dependency on tactical equipment by merging physical simulators and virtual simulations replicating a realistic training environment.   The PMT will have one instructor station, one radar set, one launching station, and an engagement control station.  Some components will be actual physical representations of the tactical hardware while other components will be virtually simulated using state of the art gaming technology of P-MET.  The two environments will work seamlessly together to simulate the tactical end items.  P-MET is a Microsoft Windows® based software application utilizing state of the art gaming technology to train U.S. Army personnel in the proper trouble-shooting techniques to repair and maintain the PATRIOT Missile System.   P-MET is the Life Cycle Replacement for the PATRIOT Intermediate Maintenance Institutional Trainer (PIMIT) for Intermediate Maintenance training but is also used for Organizational, NET, and even Depot maintenance training.  P-MET is used in an institutional, field and depot environment.  P-MET is designed and developed to operate on the RT3.  The RT3 provides a flexible training platform that may be configured to support multiple training levels and systems, via removable hard drives. In PATRIOT the RT3 is used to run the PATRIOT tactical embedded training software (re-hosted tactical training software, PATRIOT Conduct of Fire Trainer (PCOFT)) for operations tasks, the P-MET software for maintenance tasks, and the PATRIOT Skills Library (PSL) lessons for both maintenance and operator tasks. Other weapon systems may also use the RT3 platform for training (i.e., C-RAM, THAAD, and JLENS).  The RT3 is a Life Cycle Replacement for the PCOFT and the PATRIOT Intermediate Maintenance Institutional Trainer (PIMIT) hardware platforms.

The Modern Manstation (MMS) is designed to significantly improve the reliability of the legacy Manstation by replacing 221 obsolete parts in 41 assemblies and reducing Battery Replaceable Units (BRUs) from 493 to 51.  Benefits of the MMS include the installation of two 30" high resolution color LCD displays with touch panels; significant increase in Mean Time Between Failure rates; elimination of a costly Multi-Volt power supply while greatly improving the overall visual graphics used for decision making. The MMS upgrades increased Warfighter effectiveness; enable future capabilities; increase reliability; and reduce life cycle costs. Training will be aligned with the tactical system using the same technology, providing geopolitical maps, and utilizing color symbology for immediate recognition of friend, foe or unknown. Soft keys will enable future switch configurations with software upgrades. The MMS also enables future graphical user interface with Common Warfighter Machine Interface (CWMI) systems.  The MMS modification upgrade will be incorporated into the Engagement Control Station (ECS) and the Information and Coordination Central (ICC) Shelters. 

The Enhanced Launcher Electronics System (ELES) modification upgrades a PAC-2 Launcher to a PAC-3 Capability.  

In addition to the ELES modification kit, last time procurement of obsolete components will occur to support the assured producibility of the ELES.

SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO).  The SNAP/TROPO program provides units with an organic Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability and completes the 94 AAMDC UMR requirement to support both intra battalion and external battalion communications.  Troposcatter terminals allow connectivity between PATRIOT shelters when local terrain or long distances make organic Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Line of Sight (LOS) communications impossible to support fire control quality data exchanges.  SNAP terminals allow a PATRIOT shelter without access to any local infrastructure to remotely connect to both SIPRnet and NIPRnet using Ku, Ka, or X band satellites for range extension in response to Operational Need Statements from combatant commands.

Test Detachment - A manned and equipped unit consisting of various ancillary PATRIOT Ground Support Equipment elements that will assume the testing role and relieve operational units. The Air and Missile Defense (AMD) test detachment is a Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) unit consisting of 143 personnel containing a mixture of air defense, communications and maintenance Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) Soldiers which participate in all government developmental tests, missile flight tests, Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP) development and operational testing in support of the development, modernization and sustainment of current and future AMD programs.  Applied modernization configuration and capability will include funding to support the Radar Digital Processor (RDP), Modern Man Station (MMS), Combined Crypto Modernization Phase-1 (CCMP-1) and Post Deployment Build 8 (PDB-8) enhancements. Use of this detachment to support testing versus tasking operational PATRIOT units allows execution of currently scheduled testing while vastly minimizing the stress on the 15 PATRIOT Battalions in the operational force.

Digital Sidelobe Canceller (DSLC) is an Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) technique used to cancel the interference that is entering the radar via the antenna sidelobes. This is currently being performed using analog hardware in the PATRIOT radar.  DSLC replaces the analog hardware and performs this task digitally in the radars processor. Benefits of the DSLC include improved Side Lobe Canceller (SLC) Reliability and Maintainability, removal of complicated SLC adjustments, improves radar availability, removes 5 SLC Racks, provides hardware base for improved capability, and eliminates known and future obsolescence in SLC racks.

Command Obsolescence Alleviation supports updates for interoperability and supportability by working obsolescence alleviation and engineering changes.

            <proc:Description>Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battle field with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments.

This is the follow-on procurement to the integration and testing program that was funded under Program Element (PE) 0203802A; it will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory.

Block (BLK) I/IA missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). The modification will be performed as a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and will take expired assets and reset them to a 10 year service life. This effort will replace the existing M74 bomblets with a policy compliant WH, update electronics and propellants. This effort effectively brings the expired inventory back into service, while meeting the DoD CM Policy, to engage targets up to 300 kilometers (km).  A Height-of-Burst capability may be introduced under this modification pending test program results under PE 0203802A.
 
ATACMS modifications will be performed by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Grand Prairie, TX.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 procurement dollars in the amount of $116.040 million supports the modification of 121 expired ATACMS and resets their 10 year service life.  Additional supporting tasks include bunker storage, Follow-on Production Testing (FPT), Stockpile Reliability Program (SRP), rate tooling, Government System Engineering/Program Management (SEPM), obsolescence, and software.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Modification costs in FY18 include components, installation costs, and checkout in the unit price at the time of contract award.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>Block (BLK) I/IA missiles currently have warheads (WHs) that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). The modification will be performed as a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and will take expired assets and reset them to a 10 year service life. This effort will replace the existing M74 bomblets with a policy compliant WH, update electronics and propellants. This effort effectively brings the expired inventory back into service, while meeting the DoD CM Policy, to engage targets up to 300 kilometers (km).  A Height-of-Burst capability may be introduced under this modification pending test program results under PE 0203802A.  

This is the follow-on procurement to the integration and testing program that was funded under Program Element (PE) 0203802A; it will not build any new missiles or add to the overall inventory.

            <proc:Description>This modification effort will execute the inventory requirements established in the Total Army Munitions Requirement (TAMR) and will reset the 10 year rocket service life of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket system (GMLRS) rockets into either GMLRS Unitary or GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) configurations. It capitalizes on the 90% commonality between GMLRS Unitary and AW variants. The conversion process will include replacement of obsolete guidance sets, proper warhead configuration, and other critical components. 

GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.

The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments. GMLRS Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) was the first increment.  It is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets.  GLMRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is the second increment that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant. GMLRS AW is a non-cluster munition developed to replace GMLRS DPICM.  The GMLRS AW program entered full rate production in FY15.

The U.S. Army manages all three increments as part of the GMLRS Program.  This modification program along with all GMLRS rockets are produced on a common production line by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.531 million supports the continuation of the conversion test effort.

            <proc:Description>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  The Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) extends the life of the Stinger Block I missile up to 10 years by providing a more viable asset to the Army's inventory. The addition of a target detection device (TDD) to the current fuze will provide proximity capability and improved effectiveness against UAS threats, eliminating the need for “hit to kill”.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 Base funding in the amount of $63.090 million supports the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of an additional 1,147 missiles.  

FY18 OCO funding in the amount of $28.000 million supports the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) requirement for Stinger Block 1 Missiles. The Army and ERI Stinger Block 1 Missiles (Qty 576) will undergo the current Stinger SLEP to include the integration of the Proximity Fuze.

                    <proc:Description>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  The Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) extends the life of the Stinger Block I missile up to 10 years by providing a more viable asset to the Army's inventory. The addition of a target detection device (TDD) to the current fuze will provide proximity capability and improved effectiveness against UAS threats, eliminating the need for “hit to kill”.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four Stinger missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF) system and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun (M3P). The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone. Avenger is capable of day/night and adverse weather conditions; can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft; is air-droppable and can shoot on the move. The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit.

The Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew and is used to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, and fixed wing/rotary wing aircraft. Avenger fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.  Funds procurement portion of Avenger Modification program to maintain system relevance in a configuration that is sustainable against multiple threats through FY2031. The Avenger Modification program keeps Avenger sustainable and relevant until replaced by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2-Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) solution which will be fully fielded in FY31. 

The Targeting Console (TC) is a required subsystem that provides the gunner with information and controls necessary to carry out the short range Air Defense Mission. The current Targeting Console is not supportable beyond FY18. This program will fund replacement and upgrade of the TC on the Slew-to-cue (STC) units that will be able to handle the increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the FAAD early warning network.

The M3P.50 CAL machine gun is required to provide the Avenger crew with self-protection inside of the missile dead zone coverage. The M3Ps currently fielded to Air Defense Artillery (ADA) units are not supportable through FY31. This program will allow for the procurement of new M3Ps to ensure that Avenger units maintain their self-protection capability until a replacement system is fielded.

The Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC) System  is a required subsystem that allows communication between the gunner and driver. It also interfaces with the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and missile electronics resulting in improved IFF capabilities. The updated VIC replaces the Voice Intercom System I (AN/VIC-I) that is currently fielded with the Avenger.

The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) is a required subsystem of the Avenger Slew-to-Cue system that processes and displays air tracks data to the gunner. The current AFCC is not supportable through FY31. The AFCC-Revised (AFCC-R) will replace the current AFCC. The Avenger Fire Control Computer-Revised (AFCC-R) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system, ensure the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, and allow for future growth in areas such as improved fire control/longer range engagements.
The Mode 5 IFF is required to replace the compromised Mode 4 which will no longer be supported beyond 2020. Incorporation of Mode 5 IFF into Avenger is critical to retaining the cooperative target identification capability, allowing Avenger to remain relevant and effective in Air Defense and Homeland Defense missions.

The Environmental Control Unit/Prime Power Unit (ECU/PPU) is a required subsystem that provides turret air conditioning/heating and provides a separate backup power source in lieu of vehicle battery power. The ECU/PPU removes restrictions on operational use of Avenger in hot climates. This modification fulfills the user requirement for a separate, reliable power source and for heat and air conditioning to fully operate in a broad spectrum of combat environments (i.e., desert).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 procurement dollars in the amount of $62.931 million support the acquisition of components of the Avenger modification program.  These funds procure updated Avenger Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) to ensure that Avenger is viable and sustainable through the Fiscal Year (FY) 2031 timeframe when Avenger leaves the force.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>The Avenger Modification program keeps Avenger sustainable and relevant until replaced by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2- Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) solution which will be fully fielded in FY31. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensure the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC) system will be upgraded from analog to digital. Mode 5 IFF cooperative target identification functions will be added to improve the system IFF capabilities. New targeting consoles will be placed on the Slew-to-cue (STC) Avengers only. Newly redesigned components of the Environmental Control Unit/Prime Power Units (ECU/PPU) will be procured for all Active 
components.


These funds are provided to procure updated Avenger Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) to ensure that Avenger is viable and sustainable until Avenger leaves the force in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2031 timeframe.Army Avengers.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) with Far Target Location (FTL) is a combat proven system that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Active Component and Army National Guard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) equipped with Modified ITAS (MITAS) across the spectrum of contemporary operational environments. ITAS with the TOW Missile provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles, bunkers, and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. ITAS's superior surveillance capability also enables the Soldier to shape the battlefield by detecting targets at long range and either engaging with TOW missiles or other weapon systems to destroy those targets with its ability to generate a 10 digit grid coordinate of a target location.  The ITAS completed fielding to the total Army in December 2012.  The ITAS Image Enhancement (IE) Modification Kit reduces operator workload by optimizing the image presented to the gunner through electronic processing.  Electronic focus, image stabilization, and other processing techniques ensure that the image presented is optimized for the environment without manual manipulation of the various adjustment settings. This reduces the operations required by the gunner to achieve a consistent high quality image, reduces the time required to identify and engage targets on the battlefield.  ITAS continues to be the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $3.500 million supports procurement of 26 Image Enhancement Kits, required subcomponents, the fielding of the kits and subcomponents, and program management support for the Modified ITAS (MITAS) in the Stryker Anti-Tank Guided Missile (Stryker ATGM) vehicle. This procurement will field a single configuration across the US Army ITAS and MITAS fleets.

            <proc:Description>The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher (M270A1) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counter-fire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.

In FY2017, the Army decided to extend the operational life of the MLRS fleet until FY2050 or beyond and increase the size of the MLRS fleet by 160 launchers via Fleet Expansion. Fleet Expansion conducts carrier modifications to existing M270A0s and integrates the Improved Armored Cab and the FCS Mod Kit solution to build a M270A2 configured launcher.  This decision to increase the fleet’s life by more than 20 years drives numerous obsolescence mitigation, technology refresh, and future recapitalization activities of the launcher fleet beginning in FY2019. MLRS Mods address obsolescence mitigation and other design modifications via design, production, and implementation of Modification Kits to the MLRS fleet and supports Fleet Expansion through commonality with the Bradley platform.

The Improved Armored Cab (IAC) Modification Kit provides crew survivability against Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and small arms fire greater than or equal to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) Increased Crew Protection Cab (ICP). Additionally, IAC standardizes crew drill requirements between HIMARS and MLRS operators. Upon application of the IAC Modification Kit to a M270A1, the launcher permanently becomes a M270A2. First Unit Equipped (FUE) for M270A2 is projected for FY2021.

The next generation Fire Control System (FCS) eliminates obsolescence of the fielded M270A1 Improved Fire Control System (IFCS). First Unit Equipped (FUE) for an interim FCS solution is projected for FY2021. This system addresses the accelerated requirements associated with MLRS Fleet Expansion. FUE for the follow-on/long-term FCS Mod Kit solution, to include M-Code incorporation, is projected for FY2024. Benefits include a simplified design and increased reliability to reduce long-term operation &amp; sustainment cost. Additionally, the capability to launch future munitions, such as GMLRS Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS) missiles entering production, is enabled by this hardware upgrade, and associated organic tactical software, on a MLRS launcher. The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016. Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software. The technology refresh enables capability to transition from legacy tactical software to current organic tactical software of the launcher.

Army Acquisition Objective is 225 MLRS launchers. 222 physical MLRS launchers remain within the fleet.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $138.235 million support Improved Armored Cab (IAC) Modification Kit production, Non-Recurring Engineering design of the next generation Fire Control System (FCS) Modification Kit, MLRS Fleet Expansion, and routine obsolescence mitigation of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher design to retain the ability for long-term sustainment of the MLRS launcher fleet.

The IAC Modification Kit contract Option 1 will produce 76 IAC Modification Kits. IAC development completed in FY2016 and the IAC Request for Proposal (RFP) was released in July 2016. Contract award is anticipated in 4QFY2017 for Production Verification Units and 3QFY18 for Option 1.

The Non-Recurring Engineering of the interim next generation FCS Modification Kit is on-track to complete by the end of FY2019. The FCS is a required upgrade for the M270A1 to eliminate obsolescence. The FCS also enables future munition support, such as the GMLRS Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS) missile beginning production, and serves as a key hardware enabler for future transition to organic tactical launcher software. Non-recurring engineering efforts for the M993 carrier addresses numerous mechanical and technical obsolescence issues within the M993 carrier power train used on the MLRS system. The mitigation will increase commonality with the Bradley platform (configuration manager of the M993 carrier) and retain the ability to sustain the MLRS fleet. Both obsolescence efforts are critical to address prior to execution of a recapitalization program for the current MLRS fleet or MLRS Fleet Expansion initiatives.

MLRS Mods address obsolescence mitigation and other design modifications via design, production, and implementation of Modification Kits to the MLRS fleet and supports Fleet Expansion through commonality with the Bradley platform.

For FY2018, the P-3a exhibit is restructured to include better fidelity of cost elements within the Field Artillery Launchers (FAL) Product Office unique to the M270 MLRS launcher required to sustain the 222 launcher fleet.

                    <proc:Description>The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher (M270A1) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counter-fire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.

In FY2017, the Army decided to extend the operational life of the MLRS fleet until FY2050 or beyond and increase the size of the MLRS fleet by 160 launchers via Fleet Expansion. Fleet Expansion conducts carrier modifications to existing M270A0s and integrates the Improved Armored Cab and the FCS Mod Kit solution to build a M270A2 configured launcher.  This decision to increase the fleet’s life by more than 20 years drives numerous obsolescence mitigation, technology refresh, and future recapitalization activities of the launcher fleet beginning in FY2019. MLRS Mods address obsolescence mitigation and other design modifications via design, production, and implementation of Modification Kits to the MLRS fleet and supports Fleet Expansion through commonality with the Bradley platform.

The Improved Armored Cab (IAC) Modification Kit provides crew survivability against Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and small arms fire greater than or equal to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) Increased Crew Protection Cab (ICP). Additionally, IAC standardizes crew drill requirements between HIMARS and MLRS operators. Upon application of the IAC Modification Kit to a M270A1, the launcher permanently becomes a M270A2. First Unit Equipped (FUE) for M270A2 is projected for FY2021.

The next generation Fire Control System (FCS) eliminates obsolescence of the fielded M270A1 Improved Fire Control System (IFCS). First Unit Equipped (FUE) for an interim FCS solution is projected for FY2021. This system addresses the accelerated requirements associated with MLRS Fleet Expansion. FUE for the follow-on/long-term FCS Mod Kit solution, to include M-Code incorporation, is projected for FY2024. Benefits include a simplified design and increased reliability to reduce long-term operation &amp; sustainment cost. Additionally, the capability to launch future munitions, such as GMLRS Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS) missiles entering production, is enabled by this hardware upgrade, and associated organic tactical software, on a MLRS launcher. The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016. Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software. The technology refresh enables capability to transition from legacy tactical software to current organic tactical software of the launcher.

Army Acquisition Objective is 225 MLRS launchers. 222 physical MLRS launchers remain within the fleet.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counter-fire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.

In FY2017, the Army decided to extend the operational life of the HIMARS fleet until FY2050 or beyond.  This decision to increase the fleet’s life by >20yrs drives numerous obsolescence mitigation, technology refresh, and future recapitalization activities of the launcher fleet.

Army Acquisition Objective is 363 HIMARS launchers.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $9.566 million support obsolescence mitigation of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher design and long-term sustainment of the HIMARS launcher fleet.  HIMARS Mods address obsolescence mitigation and other design modifications via design, production, and implementation of Modification Kits to the HIMARS fleet.

This training consists of Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA PAM) 350-38 (Standards in Training Commission) required gunnery tables and aerial target tracking, training, and scoring. Target systems are also available to support collective training exercises and Force Development Testing and Experimentation (FDT&amp;E) investigations of engagement techniques for small unmanned aircraft systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.728 million supports Air Defense Artillery Targets and scoring, payload, and ground support equipment for training required in DA PAM 350-38, Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  These items support gunnery tables, aerial target tracking (Captive Flight Trainer (CFT), and Tracking Head Trainer (THT)5.56) training, Missile Live Fire training when missiles are allocated in accordance with (IAW) the Missile Distribution Plan), and U.S. Army Avenger systems worldwide. Training requirements are generated by Department of the Army Major Field Commands, Training Centers, Division Level Commands, and real world mission rehearsals.  These field requirements have been reviewed and validated against ongoing force restructuring and are consistent with the approved training doctrine.  These targets are necessary to meet Army Regulation 220-1 (Unit Status Reporting) training requirements, training strategies and gunnery standards, and soldier qualification in support of unit readiness.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to establish, modernize, expand or replace test facilities used in production testing of missiles and missile components.    . It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and/or economically obsolete. Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, NM and Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, AL.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>ATEC:  FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.189 million support the following:  At WSTC, provides lifecycle replacement of optical systems (high definition digital cameras, video recorders, video streamers, tracking and support cameras) to provide a reliable test capability for the collection of Time, Space and Position Information (TSPI) data as well as surveillance of all open air missile testing conducted at the test range.  At RTC, replaces obsolete and failing vertical shock machines used to perform missile shock tests by producing shock pulses within tolerances of MIL-STD-810; maintains the capability to evaluate hardware under anticipated shock environments in an efficient manner; also upgrades telemetry ground stations to reliably communicate with and track missiles in flight.  The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data are collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.</proc:Justification>

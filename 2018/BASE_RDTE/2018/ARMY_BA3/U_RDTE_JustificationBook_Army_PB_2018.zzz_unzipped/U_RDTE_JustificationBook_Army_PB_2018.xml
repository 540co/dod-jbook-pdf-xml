                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates equipment and innovative techniques for precision aerial delivery of cargo and personnel. Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.

Efforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier/Squad Portfolio.

Work in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).

The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and assesses the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under Program Element (PE) 0602786A/Project VT4. Demonstrated EBC equipment is transitioned to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).

Efforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier/Squad Portfolio.

Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts will move from Project 840 to Project ET5. Starting in FY17 Project FH4 funding and research will move to Project MM3.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced medical technologies including drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic devises, measures for identification and vector control, and developing medical practices and procedures to effectively protect and improve the survivability of United States Forces across the entire spectrum of military operations. Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.

Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is closely monitored by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as part of their processes for licensing and/or approving new medical products. The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or medical condition, starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers. Following Phase 1, Phase 2 clinical trials will provide expanded safety data and evaluate the effectiveness of a drug, vaccine, or medical device in a larger population of patients having the targeted disease or medical condition. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large Phase 3 pivotal trials will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human subjects according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.

Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's (DoD) biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.

Project 810 matures and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and medical procedures and practice guidelines intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin, muscle, nerve, vascular and bone tissues in wounded Service Members. Additionally, this Project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events, determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces, and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces. Starting in FY17 the funding for the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program moves from Project 840 to Project ET5.

Project ET5 which is a restructure of efforts funded elsewhere in this Program Element, starts in FY17 and the funding for the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program moves from Project 840 to Project ET5. Project ET5 conducts validation studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics, medical devices, procedures, and rehabilitative strategies intended to minimize long-term effects from battlefield injuries. This Project supports advancing technology supporting clinical and rehabilitative solutions to restore function of ocular and visual system post injury; and advancing regenerative techniques to restore the function and appearance of damaged tissues by regenerating skin, muscle, nerve, vascular and bone tissues in wounded Service Members.

Project FH4 matures, validates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies), validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors. Starting in FY17 the FH4 funding and research will be merged into Project MM3.

Project MM3 supports the Medical and Survivability technology areas with laboratory validation studies and field demonstrations of biomedical products designed to counteract myriad environmental and physiological stressors, as well as materiel hazards encountered in training and operational environments to protect, sustain, and enhance Soldier performance. The key efforts are to demonstrate and transition technologies, as well as validate tools associated with Soldier survivability, injury assessment and prediction, assessments for post-concussive syndrome, and enhancing performance during continuous operations. The three main thrust areas are: 1) Physiological Health and Environmental Protection; 2) Injury Prevention and Reduction; and 3) Psychological Health and Resilience. This Project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services. Starting in FY17 the FH4 funding and research will be merged into Project MM3.

Work funded in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0602787A and the Defense Health Program.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project maturates and demonstrates United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic (identification of the nature and cause of a particular disease) systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases that are threats to deployed United States military forces. The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Research conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:

(1)	Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases
(2)	Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3)	Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4)	Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control

Research is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under Program Element 0603807A, Project 808.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. 

Efforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project maturates, demonstrates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases and systems enhance the Department of Defense (DoD) ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially psychological/ mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This Project is maturing the development of holistic health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methods) and validating subclinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates across a Soldier's career. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological (mental) stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.  

This Project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services. The cited work is fully coordinated with Natick Soldier Research Development Engineering Command (NSRDEC), Natick, MA.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; and the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The effort continues to improve and mature a variety of integrated unitary and submunition system concepts to mitigate the gap that will emerge with the loss of cluster munitions. Concepts such as a unitary projectile geared towards medium armor targets, a full bore submunition with a highly reliable triple function fuze, a concept that increases the size and fuze volume of the Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) bomblet and incorporates high reliability fuzing while maintaining the traditional lethal mechanisms of DPICM. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the efforts optimize the concept of bomblet/system design and component space allocation to accommodate system level development and demonstrating concept performance through modeling and simulation. Efforts mature system level designs of unitary solutions and improve initial system level performance. Efforts continue to mature designs and exploit alternate technologies to mitigate risk; develop evaluation criteria to assess concept performance; integrate component technologies into system level solution that are effective against target sets.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates advanced technologies for future High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons technology.  The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  At entry level weapon power of around 10 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat small caliber mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surface mines, sensors, and optics.  At full weapon system power levels of around 100 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3).

This Project integrates complimentary survivability technologies to enable advanced protection suites, providing greater survivability and protection against emerging threats. This Project executes the Army's APS program to mature and demonstrate APS technologies in order to increase protection against current and emerging advanced threats while maintaining or reducing vehicle weight by reducing reliance on armor through the use of other means such as sensing, warning, hostile fire detection and active countermeasures. This Project develops an APS Common Architecture that defines the component interface standards and component specifications enabling adaptable APS solutions that can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required.

                                <r2:Title>Vision Protection:</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This effort matures and integrates devices to protect occupant's eyes, vehicle cameras and electro-optic fire control systems against anti-sensor laser devices as well as reduces the sensor's optical signature. Anti-sensor laser devices can deny vision either temporarily by flooding the sensor with too much light (jamming) or permanently by damaging the sensor. These jamming or damaging effects can slow our battle tempo, disrupt fire control solutions, or prevent vehicles from completing their mission. This effort focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of optical systems that protect sensors and Warfighter vision from pulsed, continuous wave and future laser threats to maintain fire control capability and situational awareness. Coordinated work is also being performed in Program Elements (PEs) 0602120A, 0602705A, 0602712A, and 0602786A.</r2:Description>

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance / Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test/evaluation.

Challenges addressed include: obstacle avoidance, overcoming perception limitations, intelligent situational behaviors, command and control by Soldier operators, frequency of human intervention, operations in adverse weather, and autonomy enabled vehicles protecting themselves and their surroundings from intruders. Mature technologies are incorporated onto existing, Army-owned UGV technology demonstrators so that performance of the enabling technologies can be evaluated.  

The approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced behavioral and social science technologies that enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion).  These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE validates new selection measures and performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Efforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) demonstrates and evaluates emerging technologies and systems with high payoff potential to address current technology shortfalls or future capability gaps. Efforts include: hybrid electric power technologies to reduce use of fossil fuel in tactical generators; collaboration with the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy to demonstrate technologies that provide significant gains in ground vehicle energy efficiency; demonstration of ground platform power management, generation, and distribution technologies that increase energy efficiencies and support the integration of advanced future capabilities; and field demonstrations and red teaming to stress and assess emerging systems in key areas for gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life-cycle, thus improving systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a more holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats.

Work in this PE is complementary to and is fully coordinated with PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602303A (Missile Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Will design and conduct a series of virtual scenario-based exercises, rooted in stakeholder input on emerging threats and areas of overmatch concern, with participants from government, academia, and industry who represent red (threat), blue (US forces), and green (influence base, neutrals) perspectives in order to expose assumptions, characterize needed capabilities, and identify current and future critical vulnerabilities.  Exercises will cover broader time and space conditions than are possible in live field experiments.  Will implement team challenge experiments to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks for developing concepts or systems; and, based on previous year evaluations, modify analysis methodologies, structured assessments, and frameworks to improve data captured for analysis and feedback, with the goal of providing insight and data to enable risk mitigation, informing current or future acquisition programs early in the development lifecycle. Potential technical areas of interest will include force protection, interoperability, internet of things, autonomous systems, and electronic warfare.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) addresses the supercomputing requirements of Department of Defense (DoD) scientists and engineers by: (1) demonstrating and maturing the most advanced, leading-edge computational architectures while exploiting the resulting systems by employing complementary specialized expertise; (2) demonstrating and maturing the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), which investigates, demonstrates, and matures leading-edge digital networking and security technologies to securely deliver computational capabilities to the distributed DoD Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) community; and (3) leveraging specialized expertise from DoD, other federal departments and agencies, industry, and academia to demonstrate and mature leading-edge software application codes. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive computational capabilities to demonstrate and mature emerging technologies that address the supercomputing requirements of the DoD RDTE community in the areas of hardware, software, and programming environments. All HPCMP sites are interconnected to each other, the DoD High Performance Computing (HPC) RDTE community, and other major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which investigates, demonstrates, and matures (a) state-of-the-art digital networking technologies to ensure a robust distributed environment and (b) the most advanced digital security capabilities to protect the intellectual property of the DoD and its contract entities as they employ HPCMP capabilities. The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This is a Fiscal Year 2016 Congressional increase to the High Performance Computing Modernization Program.

This Project enables the Defense Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) community to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly, and with more precision, using advanced, physics-based computer simulation supported by high performance computing (HPC) technology. The computational expertise and resources enable Department of Defense (DoD) personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state-of-the-art computer network technologies. The Software Application effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments. 

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers Portfolio.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather and other degraded visual environments). Project K70 pursues technologies that improve the Soldier's ability to see at night and to provide rapid wide area search. It also demonstrates technologies that provide the ability to perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), to integrate disparate sensor architectures, and to enable passive long range target identification (ID). Project K86 matures and evaluates sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment and deception from airborne platforms. It provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots/crew members independently for enhanced operations in day/night/adverse weather conditions.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).   

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Army facilities are subject to fines and facility shutdowns for violations of federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Efforts under this Project enable the Army to reduce environmental constraints at installations while complying with the myriad of federal, state, local, and host country environmental regulations and policy. Current and planned efforts enable the Army to efficiently characterize, assess, and sustain training and testing capacity; power and water management in contingency operations and on installations; and noise mitigation and management. Technologies demonstrated aim to reduce the cost of resolving compliance issues for the Army, avoid reductions in availability of training facilities, and sustain the viability of testing and training ranges as well as protect the critical resources, i.e., land, air, and waters of the Army.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates technologies transitioned from Program Element (PE) 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology), Projects 835 and 896 by addressing the management and mitigation of materials and chemicals released to the natural environment and the residual environmental effects of military training and operations. The emphasis of this effort includes remediation of legacy materials, e.g., traditional explosives energetics, and unexploded ordinance; management of new materials, e.g., nanomaterials and emerging contaminants; and mitigation of residual impacts from implementation of sustainable technologies and processes. Technologies matured within this Project enable the Army to cost effectively address current and future environmental liabilities resulting from the use of militarily relevant materials and chemicals in the environment. Current and planned efforts enable the Army to efficiently characterize, assess, and remediate soil and water at installations, ranges, facilities, and during operations under changing weather and climatic conditions. Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with the myriad of federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water. A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies. This Project includes pilot scale field studies to demonstrate technological feasibility and optimize performance and productivity of the risk mitigation techniques.  

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

Work in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates software and architectures for geospatial mapping applications and decision aids for the Warfighter. Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops deployed at smaller bases and in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. 

Force protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating at smaller, remote bases, or in urban environments, and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blasts, direct, and indirect fire effects using rapidly deployable protection systems and retrofits to existing structures. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for "upfront engineering" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. This work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832/Project D8Z.

This work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology). Geospatial activities are coordinated with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA). Autonomous ground resupply activities are coordinated with PEs 0603005A/Project 515 and PE 0602601A/Project H77 and 0602601A/H91 in collaboration with the Tank and Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), PE 0603001A/Project 543, PE 0603639A/Project EC3, and PE 0605805A/Project 297 with the Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC).

                                <r2:Description>This effort develops software that gathers data from multi-function Airborne ISR sensor sources into a single common operating environment to streamline analysts processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) workflows.  The focus centers on developing scalable software that provides a near real time PED capability on board the platform with applicability at the ground stations and reach back  for forensics and pattern analysis. It will increase the utility of moving target indicator (MTI) radar to the greater multi-INT picture for better origin-to-destination tracking, which is crucial to understanding the higher-level threat picture and increases the effectiveness and action-ability of battlespace awareness/intelligence data throughout an area of operations. This effort implements an open architecture extensible throughout the tactical enterprise, allowing for growth to include future ISR sensors.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates technologies to address the integrated tactical communications challenge with distributed, secure, mobile, wireless, and self-organizing communications networks and networked transceivers that must operate reliably in diverse and complex terrains and environments. Efforts demonstrate seamlessly integrated communications and information security technologies across all network tiers, ranging from unattended networks and sensors, through maneuver elements using airborne and space assets. Project EL4 matures and integrates antennas, wireless networking devices, protocols, and software; network operations tools and techniques; and combines these with current fielded networks and systems in a series of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) network modernization demonstrations to measure their technology readiness levels (TRLs) (up to TRL6) and assess them against currently fielded network architectures in an operationally relevant environment. Project EL5 matures information security devices, techniques, services, software and algorithms to protect tactical wired and wireless networks against modern network attacks; generates and distributes tactical cyber situational awareness; and focuses on configuration, operation, monitoring, defense and network reconstitution in bandwidth constrained tactical environments while reducing the operator workload required to conduct these functions.

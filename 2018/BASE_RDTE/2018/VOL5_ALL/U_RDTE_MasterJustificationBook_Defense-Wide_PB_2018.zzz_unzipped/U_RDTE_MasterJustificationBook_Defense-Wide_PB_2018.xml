                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DCMA utilizes an agile incremental approach for system development, modernization, and sustainment allowing the DCMA to deploy needed systems and major business process changes. Through major initiatives like the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) modernization, Integrated Workflow Management System (IWMS), and Talent Management System (TMS) the DCMA will reduce risk, improve performance, and enhance the competency of the acquisition workforce. These systems support the DCMA congressionally-mandated emerging missions focused on mission assurance and commercial item pricing.  Furthermore, we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment by achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture, and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

MOCAS is a hardware &amp; software computing platform used by DCMA &amp; DFAS to administer and pay contracts issued to Defense contractors. As an integrated contract administration and payment system, MOCAS is designed to provide DCMA and DFAS with the electronic information necessary to accomplish their mission of contract and payment administration. In order to implement the MOCAS technical architecture  modernization, DCMA will procure the necessary servers, storage, software, networking, and hardware.

In FY 2016 a Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) was established between the DCMA and DFAS to drive efficiencies in how these Agencies manage the MOCAS system. As a result of these efficiencies, the JPMO was able for the first time to schedule/work the design of several complex MOCAS System Change Requests (SCRs) in parallel to address multiple DoD initiatives:  Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) compliance; Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) compliance; enterprise implementation/integration of the Procurement Data Standard (PDS); improved automated/electronic Contract Orders and Modifications (EDI 850/860); and improved Treasury reporting/disbursement processing.  These efforts increased the interoperability of contract administration and contract pay activities data across the DoD enterprise, significantly reducing costs related to the Department's Procure-2-Pay mission.

IWMS
Integrated Workflow Management System (IWMS) deployed a new capability to safeguard documents from destruction by systematically placing them in a legal hold status within an electronic document and records management system (eDRMS).  This capability will enable DCMA to automatically purge contract documents that have exceeded their retention periods in the Agency’s National Archives &amp; Records Administration (NARA)- approved file plan, thus maintaining system performance and reducing future document storage costs. In FY 2016 the DCMA developed automated contract review, contract termination, and semi-automated contract data integrity screening capabilities, which will reduce backlog in the contract close out process.

TMS
In FY 2016, the DCMA Talent Management System completed development on Increment 1.1 and 2a.  Increment 1.1 provided additional capabilities on training management and 2a provided DCMA with the capabilities of Quota Management for courses and classes by fiscal year which improved planning and forecasting.  Increment 2a deployment also provided feedback surveys creation, management, and survey taking.  This capability assisted in better decision making for the Agency. Redesigned TMS to be a self-contained system, which allows the back end of TMS to be less intertwined with the DCMA database and allows for more streamlined, simplified data integration.  TMS also deployed a new developer administration tool which provides additional capabilities for developers to support the system without deploying new code. Increment 2a was fully tested and achieved operational readiness in late FY 2016.

EVAS (Earned Value Analysis System)
In partnership with industry, the DCMA hosted the Earned Value Analysis (EVA) Data Pilot effort which completed the baseline of standardizing Earned Value Metrics (EV math) ensuring consistent application across all DoD contracts with Earned Value requirements.   The intent of the Pilot effort is to develop a standard, transparent approach to automate test metrics and protocols, using data generated by the contractor EVAS and integrated sub-systems.   Automation of these metrics is required to facilitate a risk-based surveillance approach allowing movement from a calendar driven “one size fits all” approach to one that is focused on system health based upon results of data and trend analysis.    

Based on these metrics and protocols the DCMA developed/authored software requirements necessary to procure/award a COTS software solution which will be the engine that powers EVAS.  EVAS COTS software completed the rigorous IT security accreditation process which met and/or exceeded all DoD and DCMA security requirements receiving full authority to operate approval on DCMA’s information system network.

Asset and Service Management
The DCMA modernized its IT Asset and Service Management capabilities to fall in line with recent NDAA software asset and assurance changes.  In addition, this effort began to align DCMA’s Information Technology processes with systems that can execute Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices.  This included the development of configuration management capabilities which increased DCMA’s cyber security posture.

Supply Chain Risk Assessment System
DCMA made additional modifications to provide industrial base analysis capability to DCMA and DoD.

Modifications &amp; Delivery Orders
Modifications and Delivery Orders (MDO) modernization development and capability releases supported several critical DoD initiatives and Federal Acquisition Regulation/Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR/DFAR) changes, including the implementation of Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID).  The system modifications further addressed needs and requirements, such as improved efficiency in mass modification and related contract action reports functionality, to problems that slowed down or hindered optimal performance-based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components.  

Other Programs
DCMA’s other programs supports Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) modifications for industry and mainly the infrastructure backbone that supports all of DCMA's web based capabilities.</r2:Text>

In FY17 the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) will focus on the conceptual design of a modernized MOCAS Technical Architecture to further drive efficiencies in how the Agencies perform their Contract Administration and Contract Pay missions. The current MOCAS technical environment aligns with 1960s techniques and is limiting our development choices while stifling innovation. While some of the underlying MOCAS system technology has been upgraded (most recently in the 1980s), the fundamental architecture has not been updated. The approach for performing architecture and technology upgrades for the MOCAS system is complicated and will require multiple initiatives (Business Process Reengineering (BPR), Organizational Change Management (OCM) , prototyping and technical evaluations) working together to maintain business functionality as we enhance the system. These initiatives include upgrading the user interface to a modern interactive web experience, establishing configurable workflows and business rules in the system, updating the persistent data storage technologies in use, and augmenting the reporting and system interfaces to enhance interoperability within the DoD. Additionally and in parallel, the MOCAS JPMO will move from design to development on three major/complex System Change Requests (SCRs), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 850/860 recycle, Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID), and Single Line of Accounting (SLOA) with projected implementation late FY 2017/ mid FY 2018 and late FY 2018 respectively. The need for these system changes is driven not only by our internal stakeholders and customers, but also by directives and policies received from various regulatory sources such as the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO); Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L); Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP); and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)/FAR. Appropriate investment is required to implement these changes that will help the DoD move closer to achieving key goals for improving financial controls and audit trails that promote end-to-end funds traceability, compliance with data standards, and adoption of modern technologies to improve interoperability across the DoDs Procure-to Pay mission.

IWMS
Phase 2 and 3 to develop and deploy automated and semi-automated enterprise-wide contract close-out and process review capabilities though out DCMA.

TMS
In FY 2017, TMS Increment 2B will be deployed to 12,000 plus DCMA users and begin development of Increment 3. DCMA is currently finalizing Increment 2B development and beginning testing of the system. This Increment addresses needed production updates, simplifies workflows, develops Tag libraries to reduce html clutter, and provides vendor management and travel management capabilities. TMS will be intergraded with the Acquisition Workforce Qualification Initiative (AWQI) with the expected value for DCMA; Acquisition focused on-the-job development for individuals’ needs and the ability to view skill gaps at an organization level to allow for development of mitigation plans for systemic gaps.  AWQI will provide DCMA’s employees with the competency standard needed for each Job position.  This will be the beginning of DCMA’s competency assessments of its workforce.  Increment 2B is scheduled to deploy the middle of 2017. DCMA IT will also position TMS in a stand-alone infrastructure that will better support DCMA’s 12000 plus employees to improve accessibility and performance for DCMA’s training system.

EVAS
EVAS will continue its partnership with industry to maintain standardize EV metrics and protocols.  EVAS plans to execute a COTS software configuration and deployment utilizing baseline EV metrics while performing and completing Increments 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4 of configuration and testing. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is scheduled for fourth quarter FY 2017.  IOC consists of the COTS software solution fully configured, tested, and deployed on a DCMA EV Data Analysis laptop with EV automated metrics and protocols available to DCMA EVM specialists.  EVAS also plans to begin the second phase of the EVAS solution specifically the build out of the network infrastructure necessary to support the centralization of EV software and all supplier provided EV cost &amp; schedule data.   Centralization is necessary in order to deploy the EV Common Operation Picture allowing for automated real-time visibility across all EV programs, suppliers, and contracts.

Asset and Service Management

The ADL Initiative collaborates with the DoD, the Federal government, Industry, and Academia partners to shape the way people learn, grow, and perform.  The ADL Program provides DoD, other Federal agencies, and international partners with innovative: (1) standards for training and education software, systems, and associated Web services that demonstrate the “art of the possible;” (2) prototypes and proofs of concept that  harness the power of learning technologies, such as computer/Web-based training, serious games, virtual worlds, mobile technology, intelligent tutors, and other emerging learning technologies; (3) technologies and learning methods that empower learners; and (4) high-quality, easily accessible, adaptable, and cost-effective education and training.  

The ADL Initiative’s R&amp;D efforts improve efficiencies and reduce costs by (1) reducing the need for face-to-face instruction; (2) increasing interoperability--which enables discovery, retrieval, and reuse of distributed learning content; and (3) researching and prototyping methods of distributed learning with superior motivational and learning outcomes.  

ADL’s research efforts resulted in the development of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), the current de facto internationally accepted standard for distributed learning interoperability.  ADL is working in collaboration with our partners to develop the next generation training learning architecture (TLA).  The TLA will modernize the way we learn by facilitating learning experiences that take advantage of current and emerging technologies based on new standards built on web services.  ADL is conducting research on intelligent tutoring technologies that support the creation of a personal assistant for learning (PAL).  The PAL will further empower learners with effective learning content that is more personalized and context sensitive. ADL was established by Executive Order 13111, with policy oversight by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Readiness) (Training Readiness and Strategy).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

RDTE funding in FY18 will be applied to the start-up costs for expanding the recruiting database provided to all Military Services for use with officer and enlisted recruiting and to explore the merits of expanding use to civilian recruiting as proposed in a Force of the Future initiative. Specifically, the funds will provide contractor support for the development of a pilot expanded database, procurement of additional directory lists, and the purchase of IT hardware and software for the development of a user- friendly interface for accessing the data. FY18 RDTE funds in HSPD-12 will be applied to the DoD NextGen USID and will allow the Department to replace the existing Teslin ID cards which are highly susceptible to counterfeiting due to an outdated design and lack of newer anti-counterfeiting technology, by completing the design of the new card form factor utilizing the latest technical and printing techniques on a plastic substrate which will undergo extensive quality.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&amp;R)). This PE includes application of R&amp;D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and/or modernize operations required for general RDT&amp;E.

For FY 2017, as a result of a Business Process and Systems Review, DHRA has implemented a major reorganization that will impact the DHRA RDT&amp;E budget. The most significant aspect of this reorganization, from a RDT&amp;E perspective, was the integration of the Enterprise Human Resources Information System (EHRIS) into the Defense Manpower Data Center’s (DMDC) portfolio of information technology (IT) initiatives. Additionally, DHRA has implemented a major reorganization of the DMDC programs to more accurately align budget program lines with the DHRA Information Technology (IT) data reported in the DHRA IT Budget. The Defense
Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS); Data Governance; Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS); Common Access Card (CAC); Cyber Security program has been decomposed into a DEERS program and a RAPIDS program, with CAC being retained as part of the RAPIDS program. Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) has been integrated into a Personnel Accountability (PA) program, that also includes Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and the Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).

Project 1: DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs, which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600,000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program, and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&amp;E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development, calibration, and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn. This program realigned to STAR as project #9 in FY 2017.

Project 2: Human Resources Automation Enhancements. The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS), a DHRA component, manages and operates  a number of major DoD programs, including the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian human resources information system. It ensures a coherent, standardized, and cost-effective system for the entire Department. DCPDS is built using a commercial off-the-shelf product customized for Federal and Defense requirements. The system is web-enabled and provides flexibility to respond to changes in the Department's civilian human resources (HR) operational requirements.
DCPDS supports HR operations and improved business processes with continuous implementation of improved technology, meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals. Network and system operations span worldwide, with 24/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units. Other DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations, assisting laid-off workers, maintaining workforce balance, and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and unemployment compensation. DHRA/DCPAS supports the development, issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program, including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise civilian HR information system, DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program, to include a communications capability, computing equipment, and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes. This project realigned to EHRIS as project #10 in FY 2017.

Project 3: NEO Tracking System. The Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO)Tracking System (NTS) / Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25, DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USPACOM Area of Responsibility. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural, accidental, or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process. This project realigned to PA as project #11 in FY 2017.

Project 4: Synchronized Pre-deployment &amp; Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite. The Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT- ES) is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services, personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the Office of Management and Budget- directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations. This project realigned under PA, as project #11 in FY 2017.

Project 5: ESGR Awards &amp; Activity Tracking (AATR) Tool. Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) requires a comprehensive web-based application (Awards and Activity Tracking and Reporting) to track ESGR Activities to include briefings and recognition of civilian employers and briefings of National Guard and Reserve that will track against organizational goals vs. costs and the hours donated by Volunteers. The application will replace several manual processes that use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets across 54 State Committees and through contractor support. This will also place all critical data in a DoD Data Center. Development of a web-based application would immensely improve data collection and analysis while allowing field staff and volunteers to better focus on operations and mission accomplishment. The application would be an addition to ESGR’s current Portal that contains ESGR’s member management, inquiry and case management, and freedom award nomination systems. In FY 2016, funding will support the design and efforts will carry over into FY 2017. In FY 2018, funds required to build and implement design changes.

Project 6: Enterprise Data Services. Cybersecurity deals with the unauthorized exposure of classified data to WikiLeaks raised awareness on the need for improved data security management and access control measures across DoD IT enterprise. In PBR-12 one issue was critically linked to this risk and fully funded - Cross Domain Information Sharing (CDS). CDS provides for protected, automated transfer of data across networks of different security classifications reducing the need for removable media while better safe guarding the transport of information from one network to another. DMDC is developing the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS)/Access Based Access Control technology in the classified environment as an immediate deterrent to allow/deny access to classified information giving the DoD the ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g., using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication). Further, DOD will have the ability to enable, monitor and control the authorized transfer of information between SIPRNET and other DOD Networks as required via globally available and operationally effective cross domain enterprise service solutions. This was a new start in FY17.

Project 7:  Defense Sexual Assault Incidents Database.  The Defense Sexual Assault Incidents Database (DSAID) is the integrated DoD SAPR Data Collection and Reporting System that accommodates a variety of uses, including the tracking of sexual assault victim support services, support Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) program administration, program reporting requirements, and data analysis. In order to facilitate analysis at the OSD level, the System will be able to easily export data for analysis in computerized statistical applications, such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Service field-level users use the system to track support to victims of sexual assault throughout the lifecycle of that support requirement and to facilitate sexual assault case transfer between SARCs and Services. Service headquarters-level users use the system to support program planning, analysis, and management. DoD SAPR Office (SAPRO) users and Service headquarters-level users access the system to produce mandated and requested reports, monitor program effectiveness and support cohort and trend analysis.

Project 8.  Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program.   The Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) mission is to provide assistive technology and accommodations to support individuals with disabilities and wounded, ill, and injured Service members throughout the Federal Government in accessing information and communication technology.  CAP currently has partnerships with 69 federal agencies.  CAP’s wounded, ill, and injured Service member’s initiative is designed to cover active duty Service members, to include Guard or Reserve who are on active duty orders, including Title 10 orders.  Since its inception, the program has provided over 150,000 accommodations for Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD employees with disabilities and wounded, ill, and injured Service members.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 alone, CAP filled 12,789 accommodations – the most ever in a single year.  

Currently CAP utilizes a Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) product designed to support the program’s robust mission.  This product, CAP Portal, is used primarily to process DoD and other government agencies requests for hardware, software, training, and other miscellaneous accommodation services.  CAP Portal also processes information pertaining to developing and tracking requirements packages, market research, events and outreach to include proposals, presentations, materials, and assistive technology.  The CAP Portal allows staff and contract support personnel to utilize all aspects of its functionality to facilitate the provision of reasonable accommodations, and run various reports to make financial forecasts with the data that is contained within the system.

In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn. This is a new project but not a new start. This project realigned from Project 1 in FY 2017.

Project 10:  (EHRIS) is the Department’s enterprise civilian human resources (HR) transactional system supporting 800,000 employees, representing approximately one-third of the federal government’s civilian work force. DCPDS has proven its business case, avoiding costs for the Department of over $200M/year when compared to the multiple DoD Component operational costs prior to establishment of the enterprise system. 

Network and system operations span worldwide, with 24/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units. The current focus of DCPDS is the expansion of these efficiencies through the consolidation of DCPDS operations to a single database and expansion of capabilities to support integrated benefits processing and data management supporting the Department’s Force of the Future initiative.
Other DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations, assisting laid-off workers, maintaining workforce balance, and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and unemployment compensation via the Defense Injury and Unemployment Compensation System (DIUCS). DHRA/DCPAS supports the development, issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs ; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program, including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise  civilian HR information system, DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program, to include a communications capability, computing equipment, and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes. This was a new project for FY 2017 but not a new start. This project realigned from Project 2 in FY 2017.

Project 11: Personnel Accountability program is comprised of several systems, including: Synchronized Pre-deployment Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), Defense Travel System (DTS)/Defense Travel System Modernization and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilian, contractor and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD  travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees. This was a new project for FY 2017 but not a new start. This project realigned from project #3 and project #4. 

Project 12: Personnel Security Assurance (PSA) provides comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians and contractors including the technology and processes that need to be addressed in order to implement Continuous Evaluation. Planning funds within this program will support the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) which transferred to DHRA/DMDC from DLA in FY 2017. The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. This was a new start for FY 2017.

Project 13:  The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) administers many of the federal responsibilities of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) of 1986 and other federal military voter registration and assistance laws.  FVAP works to ensure Service members, their eligible family members and overseas citizens are aware of their right to vote and have the tools and resources to successfully do so – from anywhere in the world. FVAP works to Increase the likelihood of interested Active Duty Members to use available FVAP resources to increase their level of awareness of available DoD voting assistance resources, which will increase the likelihood of returning their absentee ballot. FVAP conducts voting research projects with States, local election jurisdictions and private entities to assist UOCAVA voters to register to vote and submit their absentee ballot and improve federal, State and local election processes and procedures.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In addition, changes to DCPDS are required for mandates for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), HR Line of Business (LoB), electronic Official Personnel Folder, and Retirement Systems Modernization implementation. DoD is one of five designated Shared Service Centers in the federal government focused on providing standard services across agency lines, gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative.

DCPDS is the Department’s enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800,000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department’s lead in automated systems include expansion of employee self-service functionality, and support for data warehouse improvements, engineering plans for consolidation and migration to a federal data center, an employee-manager portal, and information assurance initiatives to comply with DoD-mandated DMZ requirements. DCPDS enhancements will support the Department’s focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site, with linkage to Component operations worldwide. This project realigned to Project #10 EHRIS, in FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USPACOM AORs. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural, accidental, or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees’ movement through the evacuation process.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PA program is comprised of three sub-programs: Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS). This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, contractors, and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees. SPOT is the DoD system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. JPARR is a "public" SIPR only application that provides daily person- level location reporting. JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail. NTS is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO.

This project realigned to Project #11, PA, starting in FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

•  Provided the information on contractor personnel supporting Iraq and Afghanistan to the Office of the Secretary of Defense for reports to Congress.
•  Provided the number of contractor personnel and contract capability to Combatant Commands for operational planning purposes and to aid in their decision making processes.
•  Modified SPOT and TOPSS to accommodate the emerging requirement to account for contractors supporting Operation United Assistance in Liberia and Senegal. Deployed three JAMMS workstations for that mission.
•  Modified the Letter of Authorization format to accommodate changing requirements.
•  Upgraded to SQL Server 2012.
•  Modified SPOT/TOPSS to accommodate the new standard for Federal Procurement Identification number format for DoD.
•  Developed Audit Compliance Reports for TOPSS to allow Contracting Officers to better evaluate performance of contractor companies and hold them accountable for data maintenance.
•  Upgraded browser compatibility for TOPSS to include Internet Explorer 8/9/10/11, Firefox, and Chrome.</r2:Text>

Cross Domain Information Sharing (CDS) provides for protected, automated transfer of data across networks of different security classifications reducing the need for removable media while better safe guarding the transport of information from one network to another.  DMDC is developing the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS)/Access Based Access Control technology in the classified environment as an immediate deterrent to allow/deny access to classified information giving the DoD the ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g., using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication).  Further, DOD will have the ability to enable, monitor and control the authorized transfer of information between SIPRNET and other DOD Networks as required via globally available and operationally effective cross domain enterprise service solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) Portal has been certified as a Defense Business System (DBS). This project will help CAP obtain and maintain an optimized and     certified DBS that executes data collection, records management, and reporting accountability for all stakeholders. In order to enhance areas of program data-tracking capabilities and stabilize the environment for future operations, CAP requires modernization of CAP Portal. The CAP Portal has pages/controls that have accumulated up to 7,000 lines of code, making it difficult to ensure the reliability of any updates made to the system which has undergone over 500 change requests since its launch.
There are components and functionality that are no longer being utilized and others needed, but it is risky to remove or disable due to the interconnected nature of the codebase. The current codebase utilizes an outdated framework that is difficult to maintain. The CAP Modernization Project will implement a .NET Model View Controller (MVC) framework to separate the business, display and input layers of the code. As CAP’s operating procedures evolve, CAP Portal’s current structure will not match the changing business needs of its users. Towards that end, the issue of restructuring CAP Portal is necessary to ensure flexibility and reliability moving forward. As a result of an outdated framework, the current CAP Portal is becoming increasingly challenging to maintain and less reliable when making updates. The CAP Modernization Project will provide a restructured database for CAP Portal with an updated codebase to provide a solid foundation that supports CAP’s current structure and business processes while also increasing flexibility for future enhancements and efficiencies. All aspects of CAP Portal will be enhanced by this project, which will provide a streamlined foundation on which to incorporate new internal processing workflow entitled ONE CAP. It will provide the ability to implement new processes that reflect the current organization, roles, responsibilities, tasks and specific workflow and assignments. The modernization of technology will ensure full integration of the new internal operating model.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

One such effort will be increasing the ability for CAP Staff to update content on the CAP website, CAP Mobile App, and communications template to reduce dependence on external resources to make these changes. Also included are development efforts aimed at enhancing the ability of CAP Staff to document process actions within the system in support of procurement and acquisition records keeping requirements as well as to facilitate effective relationship management between CAP, the DoD, Federal partner agencies, and other stakeholders. Another major effort will be increasing the self-service accessibility of information to CAP customers to reduce the level of effort required to pass on information regarding their requests for reasonable accommodation.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Civilian HR automation enhancements planned for are focused on software development to support the Department’s civilian workforce, including a DoD-Wide performance management system; enhancement of employee competency assessment capability; modernization of injury and unemployment compensation case management; and EEO investigations case management. In addition, changes to DCPDS are required for mandates for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), HR Line of Business (LoB), electronic Official Personnel Folder, and Retirement Systems Modernization implementation. DoD is one of five designated Shared Service Centers in the federal government focused on providing standard services across agency lines, gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative.

EHRIS is the Department’s enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800,000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department’s lead in automated systems include expansion of employee self service functionality, and support for data warehouse improvements, engineering plans for consolidation and migration to a federal data center, an employee-manager portal, and information assurance initiatives to comply with DoD-mandated DMZ requirements. DCPDS enhancements will support the Department’s focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site, with linkage to Component operations worldwide.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PA program is comprised of four sub-programs: Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS), and the program management of the Defense Travel System (DTS). In addition to these sub-programs, at the request of Acting Secretary of Defense, PA is conducting a DoD Travel System Pilot Program (DTSPP), as part of the DTS-M effort, to determine the viability of using commercial-off-the-shelf software as a service (CSaaS) to conduct DoD travel.  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, contractors, and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees. SPOT is the DoD system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. JPARR is a "public" SIPR only application that provides daily person- level location reporting. JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail. NTS is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO.  DTS supports $3.0 Billion in annual travel across the DoD.  DTSPP will investigate the use of CSaaS to conduct DoD Travel under the Federal and Joint Travel Regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

•  Assess the impact of previous efforts to enact structured data feeds from the States and localities with the most populous number of military and overseas voters. 
•  Identify and assess the process to assess voter residency and how it impacts overseas citizen voters attempting to vote in federal elections.  
•  Study the extent to which States enact authorizations for the use and acceptance of electronic signatures derived from the Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC), or its successor. 
•  Identify the feasibility and risks associated with a comprehensive approach for States to establish a single statewide office with the technology and software to process UOCAVA absentee balloting materials.

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Each project contained within this program contains specific metrics to determine progress towards completion. Metrics for all include completed and documented analysis provided by the performer. The completion date for that analysis varies with each project. In addition, to that analysis, each effort contains a roadmap addressing the best use of the findings throughout the department. If the results of the analysis show benefit to the Department, those findings are included in policy, doctrine, tactics and procedures.  The project will yield actionable findings on how to best assist UOCAVA voters while reducing the overall reporting burden for these States to provide data on the number of absentee ballots transmitted to and received from military and overseas citizens after each federal election.  Process mappings about how the Federal Post Card Application and the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot, are treated by States for uniformed overseas and civilian overseas citizens and the impact of their residency classifications will identify the extent of uniformed and civilian overseas citizens who vote.   The acceptance of electronic signatures derived from the Common Access Card within the Department provides significant potential for ensuring the absentee balloting process is seamless for active duty military members by permitting the use of an electronic signing and submission of an absentee ballot application in those States that permit an electronic submission.  This will measure the extent to which States have proceeded with the consideration and adoption of authorizing statutes or administrative rules to permit the use of electronic signatures in a limited fashion and for a limited population of uniformed overseas voters.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced IT Services Joint Program Office (AITS-JPO) identifies and integrates new and mature commercial information technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements. AITS-JPO supports preparing for future joint force and coalition initiatives through developing and integrating a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support cooperative activities between the US and its coalition partners. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  

The program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements: (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Combatant Commands (COCOMs)/Services/Agency; (2) Joint Ventures with COCOMs/Program of Record (POR); and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR/Community of Interest. The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System process, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs. OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis.  Defense Information Systems Agency participates in both a technical and transition manager role.  The JCTDs and the Joint Ventures and risk mitigation pilots use a teaming approach thereby sharing costs and reducing the risk to individual organizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These Leading Edge products provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Senior Leaders, (e.g., the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commanders, as well as inter-agency participants) with critical focus on long-term collaboration, planning and information sharing. The Leading Edge technology pilots support future joint and coalition initiatives by developing and integrating a range of data services and advanced IT applications. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools for use by the US and coalition partners.
  
Program investments in advanced technology benefit strategic and tactical users in the intelligence, warfighting and business domains by providing them with reliable, persistent collaboration, and networking technologies including computing-on-demand to reduce the need to replicate data or services at the point of consumption. Investments also provide support for virtual end-user environments and semantic search capabilities which enhance the decision-making process. These capabilities provide the warfighter with technical superiority and to achieve interoperability and integration, while working in concert with joint, allied and coalition forces to effectively counter terrorism and enhance homeland security defense. 

The program is further divided into major subprogram areas:  Command and Control (C2) and Combat Support (CS), Information Sharing (IS), Network Infrastructure (NI), Network Operations (NetOps), Cyber Threat Discovery and Program Management Support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The decrease of -$0.791 from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the change in DoD policy where the JCTD process will be used to satisfy seven OSD identified technology problem areas.  Because of this shift, there is a reduction in the number of longer-term JCTDs (18-48 months) with the program moving towards rapid delivery of technical capabilities with Emerging Capability Technology Demonstrations (ECTDs).  ECTDs are shorter in duration (12-36 months) and provide faster delivery of capability to mission partners.</r2:Text>

The decrease of -$11.733  from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is an Agency efficiency and results in the disestablishment of the JCTD program.  As a result, civilian pay and FTEs were realigned to RDT&amp;E PE 0302019K (62 FTES), and O&amp;M (31 FTEs).  In addition, non-pay funding was realigned to RDT&amp;E PE 0302019K.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program accomplishes its mission through a combination of strategies focused on operations, technical integration, program management, and financial tracking. Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including, minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes.  It evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts. CTO reviews existing contract vehicles and the number of contracts to minimize administrative overhead.  Instead of individual contracts for program management, business line improvement, asset management, and financial management, there is now one small business program services contract that provides services across DISA.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>OSD holds program reviews twice a year to review cost, schedule, performance and delivery. For JCTDs/ECTDs, the 
program office develops an Implementation Directive and Management Plan. These guidance documents outline the 
project objectives, schedule, and funding for the JCTD/ECTDs. Military utility will be assessed by each JCTD/ECTD to develop and document the detailed objectives. The Operational Sponsor (a COCOM) will evaluate the process and measure results. For technology investigation and piloting, DISA CTO uses standard operating procedures for identifying objectives and metrics. Key metrics used include: utility of technology, time to delivery of technologies to the field, percentage of improvement in transition of technologies, and percentage of improvement in collaborative efforts with other Science and Technology organizations. See below for specific metrics:

1.  Metric: JCTDs/ECTDs provide rapid capabilities to the warfighter that address urgent COCOM needs. Metrics include: time of delivery of technology to the field and utility of technology.

Measure/Goal: Number of approved JCTDs/ECTDs with CTO as the Technical Manager and the number of JCTDs/ECTDs pending approval with CTO as TM.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

GCSS-J, the Logistics' System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (JLogCOP), ensuring the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantities across the full spectrum of military operations. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide fused, integrated, near real-time multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., Supply, Deployment and Distribution, Engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports.  GCSS-J provides real-time in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This goal was accomplished with the successful transition to a virtualized environment resulting in a more efficient system with greater reliability, better through-put, and better performance.  The Program Management Office met the functional requirements that were identified and prioritized by the Joint Staff J-4 (JS J-4) which included new widgets to improve the visibility of personnel, equipment, and supplies.

The FY 2016 to FY 2017 decrease of - $6.074 is the result of a reduction in the number of GCSS-J development efforts required to meet Joint Staff logistics operational needs while continuing to meet current functional priorities of the joint logistics community, as documented by Joint Staff requirements.</r2:Text>

The PMO will introduce SharePoint server within the GCSS-J enclave to provide an Enterprise SharePoint Solution which integrates the automated data services and visualizations provided by GCSS-J and supports site specific user defined operational pictures (UDOP).  This will promote standardization across CCMDs and allow CCMDs to use their primary SharePoint portal or alternative work space to visualize and share data with other CCMDs. Additionally, the functional sponsor approved the development of widgets to support the Operational Contract Support (OCS) community allowing visibility of contractor management, awarded procurements, and emerging requirements.</r2:Text>

The decrease of -$5.024 from 2017 to FY 2018 reduces Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (LogCOP) support to the logisticians as they plan, execute, control, and assess in an increasingly complex global environment.  Additionally, the decrease reduces the overall pace and scope of GCSS development efforts to meet Joint Staff logistics operational needs. Part of the overall decrease (-$0.274) is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO) uses various contract types, employs large and small contractors, and is focused on achieving agency socio-economic goals and incorporating DoD acquisition reform initiatives in purchasing. The PMO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements. By stating the requirements in a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements Document as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4. These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.

Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J PMO. The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are of benefiting the user. Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed. These tools become increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications, which allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services. As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics will ensure that the system is meeting user requirements.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during one of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States (US) forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North America Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  

A planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities; enabling network operation centers to priority command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, “non-mil” platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among United States (US) forces and multinational partners.

1) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations at the Secret Releasable level.  There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  

2) Pegasus connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the US, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. 

3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.

4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS) extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners, enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies. DISA's NMCS engineering program meets the NMCS systems engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.

The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS engineering focuses on implementing collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, integrating adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transitioning nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol based networks, migrating data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementing modern cryptological devices, and utilizing wireless networking to support warning systems and situational awareness. In addition, NMCS engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide required by DoDD S-5100.44 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The JSEIO conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks. Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.

The NMCS met all FY 2016 performance metrics and is on track to meet its FY 2017 and FY 2018 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within
allocated resources 100% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$1.935 in FY 2018 is attributable to the shifting of agency priorities to align with evolving mission.  The decrease is attributed to the termination in research efforts of the Service Level Interoperability of Tactical Edge Core (SLITEC).  Decrease is also attributable to technology maturing at such a rapid pace, it is imperative to rapidly assess, integrate, and transition promising technologies and capabilities.  To improve efficiency and effectiveness of these processes, the assessment framework will be streamlined to reduce the timelines, resource requirements, and fiscal requirements.  Capability prototypes will be delivered more rapidly through the use of Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs) and/or Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), and joint assessment initiatives and partnerships will be coordinated. These improvements are expected to yield an estimated cost savings in FY 2018.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EWSE uses contractors to assist/supplement the Government lead/team for technical activities. Subject matter experts in both large and small businesses are sought for the engineering support. Firm fixed price contracts with one option year are typically used in open competition. Furthermore, technical work with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) such as MITRE and MIT Lincoln Lab are established and coordinated when the Government can leverage their expertise and R&amp;D in the key technology.  

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). FFRDCs are also considered depending upon the task.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The Watchlist identifies key technology areas that are essential for Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) including:  Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, and Communication (DoDIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   
The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support Project ensure the technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and the latest Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO) Capabilities Planning Guidance (CPG) through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These strategies will establish the foundation for DISA's technology investments and technical development. The OCTO leverages emerging technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings to the DoD, the Warfighter, and other Federal Agencies, and provides actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.
Cyber security and cloud computing present critical near term challenges, especially the ability to securely leverage commercial cloud service offerings. The OCTO’s partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions. Included are applications with a security wrapper that detect and mitigate cyberattacks; smart routing and managed reputation capability; embedded system defense capabilities; and resilient and intrusion-tolerant network capabilities.
Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services. The OCTO will conduct technology assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DODIN architecture and standards. Enabled by the Technology Assessment Framework (TAF) and the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR), the OCTO will perform “quick looks” and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies. These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities; physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service APIs and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services; analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products; advanced approaches to Continuity of Operations (COOP) in a hybrid cloud environment; and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities, physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service APIs and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services, analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products, advanced approaches to COOP in a hybrid cloud environment, and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.

Will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions, provides smart routing and managed reputation capabilities; Software Symbiotes which provides embedded system defense capabilities; and advanced technologies and protocols that provide resilient and intrustion-tolerant network and messaging capabilities.  

Will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services through Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors. 

The increase of +$9.811 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is primarily attributable to the discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technology needed to support the development and adoption of key technological solutions, the realignment of civilian Full-Time-Equivalents (FTEs) and the associated payroll from PE0604764K to promote centralized, coordinated technology policy, direction, standards, and leadership allowing CTO and DISA the ability to influence and promote technology innovation that meets future DoD requirements.  In addition, CTO will perform assessment and reconnaissance of emerging technologies.</r2:Text>

It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler to leverage capabilities from five principal areas. These five areas are; Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DoDIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   CTO will conduct technical assessments for future cloud computing technologies and innovative service delivery models, mobile devices, application development and vetting best practices, and next generation virtualized Software Defined Networks (SDN) for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.   CTO will partner with commercial partners, academia, technical analysis centers, as well as organizations within the Intelligence Community, to bring state of the art capabilities to the DISA/DoD resulting in better communications and monitoring tools, enterprise services and improved end-user services and capabilities.  CTO will continue to pursue and refine methods, processes and strategies to assist in the acceleration of capability into the operational environment.                  

There is a decrease of -$1.644 from FY 2017 to FY 2018. The FY 2017 funding will be used to morph to an internet 2.0 environment where DoD, other government organizations, coalition members, first responders, private industry, academia and commercial vendors will be able to share secured data and information in such a way that adversaries can be identified, found, brought to Justice before inflicting harm on innocent citizens and allies anywhere in the world.  CTO will aggressively pursue next generation technologies to feed the internet 2.0 environment.  These technologies will be leveraged through the expansion of a CTO futuristic Skunk Works effort known as Software Defined Everything (SDE) which is based on the notion of using software to keep redefining itself, rather than being locked into operating in a specific way.  It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler for the internet 2.0 environment. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.276 is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Federal Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Number of Technology Assessments

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Networking capabilities and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.

PNVC:  The PVNC provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military, satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The decrease of -$25.050 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is primarily attributed to the one time increase in FY 2016 to complete the airborne variants of the PNVC baseband equipment. The original environmental requirements for the PNVC baseband equipment were changed in FY14 and the original designs were deemed suitable only for ground locations. This necessitated the creation of airborne variants of the baseband equipment to meet the more stringent aircraft requirements of the E-4B and E-6B platforms. The funding for the Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to develop the airborne versions came in two increments: an FY15 reprogramming and in FY16 to complete the development.</r2:Text>

These documents include:  Project Execution Plan, Concept of Operations Acquisition Strategy, Capability Production Document, System Engineering Plan and other documents required by the DISA’s Component Acquisition Executive.  Additionally, for management and system engineering support vendors, monthly reports are critical to tracking overall programmatic and engineering progress and the percent of total deliverables received on time.

For product development activities, effective progress is measured based upon the task order milestones in the form of development reviews and weekly progress meetings.  As end items (hardware and software) become available for test, additional measures will be available.  Specifically, the percentage of successfully verified requirements out of the number tested and the number of critical trouble reports outstanding longer than six months, will be tracked.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DISN Systems Engineering Support project encompasses four activities:

Next Generation Networking Technologies (formally known as Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical Transport Technology Refresh):  Provides engineering technical expertise to support and integrate newer, more efficient technologies required to replace end of lifecycle equipment and to achieve more efficient Networking technologies.  These new technologies provide protected and assured services for critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.

Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).

Peripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  

DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Engineer with plans and procedures, systems analysis, operational assessments, systems engineering, and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provide the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The increase of +$3.672 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to additional number of technical assessments required, expansion of the production of architectural artifacts required to complete the NLCC Technical Architecture; development of a NLCC Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability; support engineering and implementation of the NLCC enterprise mobility infrastructure. Part of the overall increase (-$0.297) is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by compliance with contract deliverables schedules for specifically included products, such as: operational assessment plans, operational assessment reports; recommended revisions to the Joint Staff’s Emergency Action Procedures (EAP-CJCS) Volumes VI and VII; updates to NC3 System Description documents and Nuclear C3 Architecture Diagrams. In addition, performance of the NC3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element. These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management. Performance of the SLC3S-Airborne fleet is measured by the technical assessment results documented in the assessment reports. Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff and the DoD CIO to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.

Specific performance metrics include the following:

Provide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.

Conduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.

MEECN achieved all its FY 2016 performance metrics and is on track to achieve the FY 2017 and FY 2018 targets of provisioning the Joint Staff requirements within the allocated resources 90% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment. One of the key capabilities residing within the JPES portfolio of sustaining the existing Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) while modernization of JOPES is planned and implemented.  The JPES portfolio also includes a core set of infrastructure services consisting of  the JPES Framework (JFW) and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection (JFP), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) and eventually the capabilities that will replace JOPES.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) is DoD’s Joint Command and Control (JC2) system of record and provides the foundation for migration of service-unique C2 systems into a Joint, interoperable environment. The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  Each year, the DISA architecture team, annually, produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities, anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the JC2 community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Use of performance-based contract awards is maximized while use of Time and Material contracts is minimized to those providing programmatic support versus software development, integration, or testing.  All development, integration, and migration efforts within the portfolio are primarily supported through Cost Reimbursable Task Orders issued under competitively awarded contracts.  Acquisition Strategies are structured to retain contractors capable of satisfying cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Contract awards incorporate provisions requiring contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data.  This strategy mitigates risk by requiring monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs) and utilizing award fee contracts where appropriate to incentivize performance.  Both GCCS-J and JPES apply formal acquisition rigor to include reporting requirements, as appropriate, by acquisition program designation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Spectrum Center (JSC), which is a division of Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO), designs, develops, and maintains Department of Defense (DoD) automated spectrum management systems, evaluation tools, and databases. The databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment (EME). Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.
 
Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The DoD E3 Program supports the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process and the DoD acquisition process to ensure that E3 control and spectrum supportability are incorporated into the development, testing, and procurement of information technology and National Security Systems. The E3 Program also supports the development of the Joint Ordnance E3 Risk Assessment Database (JOERAD) and Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) electromagnetic environmental effects surveys in support of the COCOMs and Joint Task Forces. JOERAD develops algorithms and provides analytical capabilities to perform real-time risk assessments to evaluate platform/system safety and identify equipment limitations in the operational EM environment. JOERAD enables operators to make critical decisions about the hazards associated with the use of ordnance within complex EM environments. A SSRA is performed by program managers and materiel developers on all programs that are acquiring or incorporating spectrum-dependent systems or equipment per DoDI 4650.1. These assessments encompassed regulatory, technical, and operational spectrum and E3 issues and associated risks.</r2:Description>

The goal of the EST program is to identify the opportunities and risks associated with emerging spectrum-related technologies in the early stages of the technology development, influence and lead technology development in order to maximize DoD spectrum utilization, and ensure that spectrum policies incorporate optimal technology to meet DoD mission requirements. Within EST there is an increased focus on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). DSA is realized through wireless networking architectures and technologies that enable wireless devices to dynamically adapt their spectrum access according to criteria such as policy constraints, spectrum availability, propagation environment, and application performance requirements.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office Enterprise Services (PEO-ES) provides a portfolio of enterprise level services that enable communities of interest and mission applications to make their data and services visible, accessible, and understandable to other anticipated and unanticipated users. The continually expanding portfolio of enterprise services supports 100 percent of the active duty military and Government civilians; 258 thousand embedded contract personnel; 75 percent of the active Guard and Reserve; and 25 percent of the Guard and Reserve users. This meets the Department’s requirement to support 2.5 million users on the Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) Internet Protocol (IP) Data network and 300 thousand users on the Secret IP Data network. The portfolio of services continues to expand through the transition of local services to the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise and providing enhanced functionality that allows DoD personnel to go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive, the implementation of an access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing throughout the DoD, and the integration of pre-planned product improvements to existing enterprise services keeping them relevant to the end-users’ missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office Enterprise Services (PEO-ES) continues to expand their portfolio of services that currently includes the core capabilities delivered by the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program, with a resilient and flexible access control infrastructure that enables strong authentication for secure information sharing in the Department of Defense (DoD), and the identification, transitioning, and operationalization of local services into the larger DoD enterprise. Critical warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services within the portfolio include an enterprise collaboration capability supporting over 900,000 DoD users, Enterprise Search that exposes data sources throughout the DoD, Service Oriented Architecture Foundation supporting a robust Enterprise Messaging service that provides producers the ability to publish one message that, in turn, can be distributed to hundreds of end-points supporting the subscribers to that information and a critical enterprise authoritative data source service that supports the user’s need to identify and use authoritative data and services. The portfolio also includes the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb) providing decision and event management support to all levels of a widespread user-base that ranges from the Combatant Commanders to the Joint Staff to Coalition partners on the Secret Internet Protocol (IP) Data network; DoD Visitor that allows personnel to “go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive;” the DoD Enterprise Portal Service that provides users with a flexible web-based hosting solution to create and manage mission, community, organization, and user focused sites; and privilege management Authentication Gateway Services (AGS) that is integrated with the Identity and Access Management services supporting brokered Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication for DoD applications without a native PKI authentication capability. The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs. This flexibility provides unprecedented access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information, and temporarily stores critical data in a secure environment. The portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by US Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations. These enabling benefits include the ability to:
•	Enhance collaborative decision-making processes
•	Improve information sharing and integrated situational awareness
•	Share and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands
•	Share and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources
•	Schedule and coordinate meetings with people across the DoD Components
•	“Go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive”
•	Create and manage mission, community, organization, and user-focused sites from global locations
•	Exchange knowledge to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and accurately assess the effects of that action
The portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric Enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and Coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The portfolio of services is leveraging portions of the acquisition approach approved for the NCES Program. Based on the approved NCES acquisition strategy, the portfolio will adopt proven specifications, best practices, and interface definitions to adopt or buy new network-based services or applications that are delivered, hosted, and managed in accordance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and that ensure available, reliable, and survivable services to support the warfighter’s mission.
The portfolio is using a streamlined acquisition approach to ensure that the required acquisitions contain only those requirements that are essential to meet the warfighter mission and that they can be acquired in a cost effective and time constrained manner that meets the defined mission need. This strategy will enable the rapid fielding of low to moderate risk capabilities to meet end-user operational needs through an agile requirements collection and engineering process that supports the acquisition, testing, and fielding of needed requirements in minimum time. The benefits provided by this acquisition approach include:
•	Satisfy time-urgent needs of the warfighter or theater commander
•	Provide early and continual involvement of the user
•	Evaluate the portfolio to determine optimum funding approach to rapidly deploy urgently needed services within the funding profile
•	Effective control processes that lower cost and maintains schedule
•	Provide multiple, rapidly executed increments or releases of capability
•	Early dialogue between the requirements and acquisition communities to expedite technical, programmatic, and financial solutions
•	Enable “insight” not “oversight” to identify and resolve problems early and ensure both the acquisition process and deployed service meets 
                     performance goals
•	Enable agility in selecting modular, open-systems approach
This business strategy will strike a balance between ensuring accountability using acquisition best practices and deploying urgently needed services to the warfighter on a schedule that will support their mission requirements. The goal is to facilitate the DoD enterprise cloud vision where users and Programs of Record easily access enterprise services from maritime, airborne, and land-based locations worldwide through a federation of core data centers. The user community will guide how the portfolio of services must evolve to remain relevant to the Warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area mission requirements. By partnering with the DoD Components and Mission Areas, the Defense Information Systems Agency will rapidly deliver functionality and capability at the lowest possible cost and risk in the shortest possible timeframe.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The management areas are designed to ensure that problems can be identified rapidly for resolution, while providing maximum support to the warfighters’ mission. The metrics associated with these management areas provide quantitative data to show that the portfolio of enterprise services are secure, interoperable, and responsive
to current and future warfighter missions in a cost-effective manner. The management areas and metrics will be used to continuously evaluate the value of services to the Warfighter. They will be used to determine the right time to scale and update services to keep them relevant to the warfighter’s mission. Also, when necessary, they provide the necessary artifacts to make decisions to continue, shutdown, or place in caretaker status capabilities that are not performing as expected or where the user demand has slipped or never grew to the level of keeping the service cost effective.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Information Environment (JIE) construct is a consolidated secure and defensible environment across DoD.  This is comprised of unified, consolidated and shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and standardized security architectures throughout the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.  

The target objective state of JIE is a DODIN that optimizes the use of DoD's IT assets from the administrative and operational planning at the Pentagon to the tactical edge; to include our mission partners through converging communications, computing, enterprise services, and defense of the DODIN that can be leveraged for all Department missions. 

When implemented, JIE will reduce DoD's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improved security by reducing the attack surface of our networks, and enable Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies (CC/S/A) to more efficiently access information to perform their missions from any authorized IT device, any time, from anywhere in the world.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The savings are realized by coupling the JRSS and JMS. The JRSS collapses replicated IT security functionality for all Department of Defense (DoD) components into relatively few regionally located stacks.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint DoD security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world. Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.															
															
FY 2016 (Estimated): N/A															
															
FY 2017 (Estimated): 100% successful testing of new pre-production capabilities for Full Packet Capture analytics (e.g. ArcSight and Splunk log); JMS 1.5 data orchestrator aggregation; and JRSS 1.5 active stack capabilities through the Joint Interoperability Test Command.															
															
FY 2018 Target: 100% successful testing of Break &amp; Inspect SIPR capabilities and Inline Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPCS) in the development environment as well as testing of 6 medium complexity analytics.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

The decrease of -$25.000 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the completion of initial advanced development capabilities and the planned transition to sustainment of initial capabilities delivered in FY 2017.  Advanced development capabilities prototyped in FY 2017 included (not limited to): Case Management, Imaging, Workflow Management, Virtual System Access, Automated Records Check, and E-Application. These advanced capabilities will reduce overall program and technical risk with respect to delivery of the new National Background Investigation System.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible. The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2018.

Generation 1/2 Metric:

Percentage of system changes resulting in interoperability certification

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible. The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Generation 3 Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Generation 3 Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to perform acquisition testing.

Across appropriations, performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2015, FY 2016 and FY 2017.

Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual, operationally-relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The DCGS T&amp;E FT performs a minimum of six DCGS Enterprise assessments per year, and the results are consolidated into the T&amp;E FT Enterprise Assessment Report annually.  The T&amp;E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time.

The T&amp;E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity. In FY 2016, T&amp;E FT performed twelve (12) DCGS Enterprise assessments.  This trend is expected to continue in FY2017. Of the six DCGS PoR systems, two hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, &amp; Computers/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases. One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending. Of the three remaining PoRs, two are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&amp;E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events. Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&amp;E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.

In FY 2016, T&amp;E FT conducted twelve (12) DCGS Enterprise assessments.

In FY 2017, T&amp;E FT will perform a minimum of ten (10) DCGS Enterprise assessments.

In FY 2018, T&amp;E FT will perform a minimum of nine (9) DCGS Enterprise assessments.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible. The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2018.

Generation 1/2 Metric:

Percentage of system changes resulting in interoperability certification

FY 2016 Actual: 100%
FY 2017 Target: 100%
FY 2018 Target: 100%</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Theater Enterprise Deployment and Distribution (TED2) analysis, the Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCC) identified several gaps between United States Transportation Command's strategic lift processes and GCCs' distribution processes.  Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo/passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Theater Capability, through the implementation of process improvements, integration of commercial transportation management/optimization tools, and the development of deployment/distribution supporting technologies, will provide the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Through the Theater Enterprise Deployment and Distribution (TED2) analysis, the Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCC) identified several gaps between United States Transportation Command's strategic lift processes and GCCs' distribution processes.  Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1.) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo/passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2.) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Theater Capability, through the implementation of process improvements, integration of commercial transportation management/optimization tools, and the development of deployment/distribution supporting technologies, will provide the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters’ needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  

Beginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  
•	The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  
•	Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. 
•	The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.    

Over the FY 18- FY 22 Planning Period, funds were realigned within the ManTech PE, from the DLA Log R&amp;D PE (0603712S) and DLA Procurement Defense-Wide Fund.  These funds will address critical shortfalls in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes and Maintaining Viable Supply Sources.  The largest requirement was in the Maintaining Viable Supply Sources to develop a long-term, reliable source of linear microcircuits.  These devices are critical to maintaining the readiness of front line weapon system electronics.  High priority requirements in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA included additional funding for battery technology, castings and forging manufacturing technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings/Forging Programs and Additive Manufacturing programs.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. BATTNET conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries.  BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

DLA is also conducting some short-term (FY17-FY18) manufacturing improvements in the Vacuum Electron Tube supply chain within this Budget Project. Electron tubes are still an essential product in Defense and National Security radar systems. included will be value-added studies and tests of alternative materials for tungsten wire and microwave quality glass to address obsolescence in these material supply chains.

The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) Program is a Manufacturing Technology Program and is the successor to the CORANET R&amp;D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program's expanded areas of interest includes: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. Desired outcomes include measures such as reduced cost, increased efficiencies, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.

The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DLA will work short term projects (STPs) with the community of practice partners of the military services, industry and academia.  SUBNET plans to improve process capabilities by identifying targets for product, automation and business operation changes, and implementing solutions in the Subsistence Supply Chain to produce such improvements as shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead cost, and improved quality. The STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as return on investment where applicable to ensure that all SUBNET STPs are fully documented, all projects have the potential for implementation in industry; and all projects address a specific DoD/DLA need.  

The Castings program will receive a significant increase in funding starting in FY17 to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR 17 process. Projects identified will investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter.  Contracts will be competitively awarded in FY17.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success.

The Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.

The Battery Network funding will be applied to pursue additional projects including production readiness of lithium conformable soldier batteries, military ground vehicle batteries, and aviation batteries; manufacturing transition of legacy and obsolete lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries to advanced lithium-ion batteries; and battery manufacturing automation and optimization technologies. These projects will address pressing supply chain issues by migrating from declining manufacturing to a high growth industrial base, and will achieve cost reduction by optimizing the manufacturing design, assembly, and test processes.

The Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.

FY 16 – FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust.</r2:Text>

The Program will also leverage new battery manufacturing technologies for the supply chain that have been developed in SBIR - electrode laser cutting, solvent-free electrode production, low cost materials production or recycling, advanced performance cells. DLA will also complete the initial investments in manufacturing and material improvements for the vacuum electron tube supply base (used in microwave and radar systems) and pursue additional opportunities.

The Subsistence Network program plans to initiate and execute short-term projects in FY18, and continue efforts from FY17. SUBNET will also continue to pursue Small Business Innovation Research Topics in Subsistence. The Subsistence Network will also continue to work with community partners (military services, industry, and academia) to leverage the latest technologies, encourage innovation and modernization, and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain.

The Castings program plans to investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter. Contracts will be competitively awarded to fulfill those requirements. Projects will be required to include a business case with specific metrics and a transition plan for success. The Casting program will also continue executing projects approved and awarded in prior years. 

The Forging program will also continue executing projects approved and awarded in prior years. In addition, the Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.

Contracts will be competitively awarded to fulfill those requirements. Project will be required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging program will also continue executing projects that are approved and awarded in FY17.

DLA R&amp;D plans to leverage Industry and the Military Service Engineering Support Activities (via Service-level agreements with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force) and the Department of Energy by providing funding for AM work identified under the respective agreements. Desired outcomes include: acceleration of rapid qualification and certification methodologies for AM, identification of AM applications for castings and forging preforms, rapid cast production and repair of castings using AM, exploration of conversion of recyclable materials to AM material, improved reverse engineering processes for AM purposes, and optimization of metal AM production to obtain land, air and sea platform spare parts. These efforts seek to increase the number of AM parts qualified for procurement and achieve savings from the associated lead-time, storage costs, transportation costs, in some cases reduction of fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. Overall AM efforts will provide alternatives in product realization in order to address unfulfilled Warfighter readiness needs.</r2:Text>

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  

Strategic Materials is a new area for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements. Targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE will begin a major new thrust in emulation to address Linear Microcircuits in addition to its traditional focus on Digital.  Several efforts will address basic design, manufacturing, electrical test and quality/reliability requirements for establishing a basis for product-oriented developments across the FYDP. MAE will also complete development and transition Advanced Schottky TTL Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also continue development of additional emulation capabilities including TTL-Compatible CMOS. MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of a 1 million gate Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and 512K Read-Only and Random-Access Memory Emulation Capabilities. It will complete prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.

Strategic Materials: A request for white paper proposals was recently added to DLA’s Emerging R&amp;D Requirements BAA for critical initial manufacturing technology requirements in domestic high strength carbon fibers.  Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.  Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.

The MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

The DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.

The Emerging Manufacturing Technology program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DLIR program will continue moving DLA from PDF Tech Data to Smart Data and Engineering Models and leveraging semantic technology to improve logistics data across the DLA Enterprise.

Emerging Manufacturing Technologies addresses the opportunities to start new manufacturing technology developments that occur out of the budget cycle. It is a new start in FY18.  Having an Emerging Technologies line allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs. In other programs DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off project start-up lead-times. Saving the startup lead-time allows the Agency to get advanced technology into the hands of the warfighter earlier that would otherwise be the case and begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case. It also allows ongoing programs to maintain continuity of funding and activity. SBIR phase III efforts (which can't be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging battery technologies, and technologies to address strategic materials shortage/risk.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, and combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate – including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLAs Generic Logistics R&amp;D Technology Demonstrations (Log R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available to accomplish the agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources and applying the most effective business processes. The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs. The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  

In December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&amp;D program in support of the agency’s mission. As a result, the R&amp;D program evolved from single supply chain efforts to Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs). The SFAs support DLA’s efforts to make the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness rates in a constrained budget environment. 

The three Strategic Focus Areas were renamed in FY 2021 to more clearly capture their focus and scope:  

1. Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (formerly Analytic and Decision Support): R&amp;D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.
2. Improving Logistics Processes (formerly Logistics Processes): R&amp;D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.
3. Emergent Logistics R&amp;D Requirements (formerly Innovative Products and Services for Customers): R&amp;D Efforts to support emergent Logistics R&amp;D requirements arising outside the budget cycle, a frequent occurrence.  The SFA begins new projects promptly without the disruption of ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes.

These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible responsiveness to emerging market and customer requirements. Currently, there are three major analytical thrusts: Planning Processes, Medical Supply Chain, and Distribution/Disposition. Planning processes model simulates item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories, acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items). Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies. The Strategic Distribution and Disposition (SDD) thrust will develop and implement analytical tools, models, and simulations of logistics and supply chain processes related to distribution and disposition.

The Medical Logistics Network will expand efforts in medical informatics, a growing area of health information systems that combines information science, computer science and health care to improve health systems to manage the healthcare supply chain more efficiently.  

The mission of the SDD program is to assist DLA Distribution and Disposition Services in anticipating, assessing, and meeting current and future Warfighter requirements by leveraging R&amp;D to infuse innovative solutions.

This strategic focus area has 2 thrusts: Technical/Quality (T/Q) Process Improvements and Selected Process Improvements

T/Q Process Improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters.  Services have engineering responsibility for most Class IX parts. Many T/Q sub-processes involve interactions with Service engineering functions, which often are time-consuming and costly.  Other key T/Q sub-processes are essential to the procurement function, such as analysis of parts content, source capabilities and problem resolution.

Selected Process Improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical/Quality (T/Q) function. Although all DLA processes are in scope, the focus for FY 2016 is on the Procurement process, especially aspects driving internal costs and delays in awards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In the past DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times.  Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs.

DLA and the Military Services will identify lists of candidate parts for AM to be used for vendor solicitation. DLA R&amp;D has established AM Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), and U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), and currently developing MOAS with Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM). These MOAs will allow the Agency to begin the transition of AM as a new alternative into its procurements activities. 

Energy Readiness will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers.</r2:Text>

Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs. Augmented reality is an emerging technology that has potential to advance to the forefront. Complete the Advanced Thermoelectric Technology  project to improve the current thermoelectric heater technology so it is more fuel-efficient, has an increased heating range, reduced maintenance requirements, and a longer service life. The Advanced Thermoelectric Heater will replace the existing Space Heater Convective standard heaters currently stocked at DLA, and will provide DoD a single, versatile heater that reduces the logistics footprint and satisfies the space heating requirements of expeditionary forces.

In FY18, the AM project will be funded under PE 0603680S / Manufacturing Technology Program (ManTech) Project 7 - Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (formerly Material Availability). This realignment will maintain continuity of funding and activity for this program.

ERP will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>USTRANSCOM is tasked to provide globally integrated, agile deployment and distribution solutions as well as related enabling capabilities to support national security, force readiness and sustainability within an increasingly constrained defense budget. Unpredictable/extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/area denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information, invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success, ensure the viability of our capabilities, and implement a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes as well as the ability to effectively collaborate/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote the effective/efficient/responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility, enhance planning/execution, and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process/system architecture which will integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DoD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Additionally need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DoD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion to include drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities. Current planning/forecasting/collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems to include the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need. Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces. The ability to rapidly determine the impact of any delays/changes and conduct "what -if" impact assessments on the closure of force packages is required. This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce low volume State-of-the-Practice (SOTP) and legacy microelectronics that are unavailable from commercial foundries. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing a guaranteed and Trusted source of supply of microelectronics parts that are essential to combat operations. In addition DMEA provides the rare technology capability to bridge the gap between research and application allowing DMEA to develop, manage and implement innovative microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  

This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. These threats include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned, their extended combat use increases attrition and the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases. 

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires low volume SOTP and legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. To meet these requirements, DMEA procures commercial licenses to organically produce semiconductor technologies that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and guaranteed source of these critical parts.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication expertise to ensure that the Department can field systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions – along with its unique technical perspective – allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.

Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now guaranteed to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.

These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production order. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence necessary in an industry partner to ensure them that their IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a weapon system operational, elevate its sophistication level or to meet new threats. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA
maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with
distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, guaranteed and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, and the incorporation of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands. 

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and are required to remain in service beyond planned replacement schedules, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing many systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DMEA applied advanced technologies to add performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. In FY16 DMEA worked 256 tasks (Army 24%, Navy/Marines 27%, AF 33%, Other DoD 11%, and Non-DoD 5%) totaling $1.29B and resulting in over $540M of cost avoidance/savings.  Examples of cost avoidance include $106M for the C-5 Data Transfer Device, $200M for the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar System and $40M for the HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter. In keeping with the rapid pace of microelectronics technology, DMEA continued the process of extending its fabrication capability to smaller node sizes. DMEA started installation of the cleanroom in the 200mm facility.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities that might be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies as illustrated by the recent acquisition of IBM’s semiconductor manufacturing capability by GlobalFoundries. This acquisition, caused by economic pressures, has again highlighted the fact that commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. This trend is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other areas of defense interest, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Microelectronics program provides the Department with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. DMEA will focus on fostering all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted and assured microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Microelectronics access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The amounts included for 2017 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution. 
EFD Base: FY17PB ($3.800M) + Request for Additional Appropriations ($1.860M required to address emergency warfighter readiness. Funds are in support of the RDT&amp;E Project Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) Phase 2 Design, Development, and Deployment. These funds are needed to ensure continued on time development and software upgrades for EFD capability, specifically the SFIS/GL requirements required by 30 September 2017 to support DOD Audit compliance mandate. Additionally, these funds are needed to ensure remaining Phase 2 requirements are designed/deployed on time to eliminate on going excessive parallel data entry operations required from the DOD EFD user community. Such operations jeopardize data integrity and negatively impact audit readiness preparation efforts.) 
NGRMS Base: FY17PB ($8.831M) + Request for Additional Appropriations (-$8.831M realigned for NGRMS from the Defense Logistics Agency to OSD to align funding with the program office for more efficient execution.)

PB18 NGRMS was removed across the FYDP as the program has been fully sunsetted. Some of the NGRMS was omnibus reprogrammed to Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD).</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is a systems solution that specifically addresses the security clearance and suitability adjudicative requirements of Section 3001 of Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) and the Joint Reform Team's Security and Suitability Process Reform Strategic Framework as published in February 2010 which requires 90% of all clearances - whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential - to be completed within 60 days. The first 40 days is to complete the investigative phase and the remaining 20 days is to complete the adjudicative phase of the clearance review. In addition to national security clearance determinations, DISS supports Suitability and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) credentialing eligibility compliance across the Department of Defense (DoD). The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRTPA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce. 

The DISS is comprised of two key application components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS). Currently, CATS is deployed in multiple versions (V1-V3) at the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF); whereas the CATS component of DISS will upgrade CATS (V1-V3) technology stack and consolidate capabilities into a single baseline in FY2017. CATS (V1-V3) are operational fulfilling the requirements to receive background investigations and adjudicate national security, suitability and HSPD12 credentialing eligibility determinations via electronic and human adjudication processes. Historically, CATS electronically rendered favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret-level cases. New Tier 3 e-Adjudication business rules for access to Secret information were approved in September 2016. JVS will be used by the security management community to manage subject's access to information based on eligibility, communicate with the CAF, manage subject incidents, and additional subject details such as reporting, travel, and relationships. The DISS will incrementally deploy additional capabilities to address functionality gaps between DISS and the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). DISS will enable consistent standards throughout the collateral DoD Personnel Security, Suitability and HSPD12 mission areas. CATS (V1-V3) instances and JPAS, once fully replaced by DISS, will be decommissioned. JPAS is projected to be decommissioned in FY2019 but this may be adjusted based upon DISS deployments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The DISS CATS has been designated as the DoD non-Intelligence Community IT system for case management and adjudications by the 10 April 2009 USD(I) memo “Designation of the DoD Case Management and Adjudication Systems.”  Currently, CATS processes over 500,000 cases annually; electronically producing favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret level cases.

Further, the 3 May 2012 Deputy Secretary of Defense Memo “DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Consolidation” consolidated all DoD CAF into one consolidated DoD CAF responsible for personnel security adjudicative functions as well as favorable Suitability and HSPD-12 adjudications.  The DISS (CATS) is the DOD CAF’s designated IT case management system.

Achieving the above goals will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the national security community and the Federal government.  It will decrease the time required to get an individual through the investigation process.  It will strengthen and reinforce reciprocity throughout the federal community by eliminating redundant or incomplete investigations by standardizing adjudicative decisions and by making available to all agencies adjudicative determinations of the Federal government.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On May 09, 2013, the DISS CATS received a Full Deployment (FD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which acknowledged that CATS was operationally fielded at the five adjudication facilities and authorized the DISS PMO to enhance and field a consolidated CATS (CATS v4) and its associated portal in order to improve the lifecycle management of the CATS by consolidating the existing CATS applications into a consolidated CATS application that uses a single database.  The July 11, 2014 “DISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum” revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The  JVS Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed in FY15 Q2 and this initiated the Engineering Development phase in which the program will refine system requirements, configure the software, build functionality, conduct developmental testing, and plan for operational testing.  These activities will continue until a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) is made.

The DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities. DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program’s acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting. As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer. Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets. These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies. These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information. Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant. Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information. The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices. They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw
conclusions. Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements. The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The amounts included for 2017 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution. Base: FY17PB ($26.657M) + Request for Additional Appropriations ($3.800M required to address emergency warfighter readiness. Funds are in support of the production environment for new agencies and meet the additional vendor software server requirements as DAI updates the other portions of the DAI Suite including, Operating system upgrade, Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, and other applications/utilities to maintain currency with support. The increases will largely support Washington Headquarters Services and supported agencies. The data volume for WHS is roughly three times the volume of the largest DAI deployed agencies. Additionally, the growth in the number and size of attachments has resulted in higher storage requirements. This funding will also support additional equipment and services from Defense Information Systems Agency's Defense Enterprise Computing Center Ogden, UT.)

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness. Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.

The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.  The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.

The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.3 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).

DAI supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”. DAI is also aligned to the  DOD Agency Strategic Fiscal Years 2015-2018, Goal 5: Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, Key Strategic Initiative - Improving competitiveness through accountability and efficiency and SO 5.2: Improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness. The objective of the DAI system is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data.

The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay (P2P); Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Release (Rel) 1 provided an application upgrade to Oracle R12 along with (P2P) enhancements facilitating SFIS/SLOA compliance and automated Time and Labor absence management.  Rel 2 introduced Grants Financial Management accounting and the start of a phased implementation of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) capabilities. Future capabilities will support Rel 3 Direct Treasury Disbursing and Budget Formulation as well as Rel 4 Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).


DAI is currently implemented at 20 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 29,990 users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) assertion packages.

The benefits of DAI are:
•	Common business processes and Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS and SLOA);
•	Access to real-time financial data transactions;
•	Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
•	Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; and
•	Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO completed the Oracle R12 application upgrade.  The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.  

DLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  While the DAI PMO serves as systems integrator, niche activities; i.e. P2P, development, are contracted.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than superior management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers.  It requires supply chain excellence.  Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe, requires that DLA-managed materiel flows seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit innovative technical applications of existing technologies to solve current and future agency requirements.  Proposals from the small business community will fulfill this requirement.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve a reasonable degree of technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit supporting a Phase II award. Direct impact on a DLA solution, future market possibilities and demonstrated commercialization potential have a strong influence on Phase II selections.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

The Defense Logistics Agency's SBIR/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within several DLA Elements:

2.  Commercialization:  The Congressional language defines “Commercialization,” which is clarified by the Office of Secretary of Defense Office of Small Business Programs (OSD/OSBP) Re-Authorization Policy Directive:
- (Investment) The process of developing products, processes, technologies, or services; and/or 
- (Sales) The production and delivery (whether by the originating party or by others) of products, processes, technologies, or services for sale to or use by the Federal Government or commercial markets    

The Small Business Administration and OSD/OSBP assign a Commercialization Index based on progression within the Phases and reported successes.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Industrial Preparedness Manufacturing Technology (IP ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters’ needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  

Beginning in FY16, DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  
•	The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly known as the Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  
•	Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future, it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. 
•	The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly known as Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Over the FY 17, $9.346M was realigned to the ManTech PE from the DLA Log R&amp;D PE (0603712S) and DLA Procurement Defense-Wide.  These funds will address critical shortfalls in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes and Maintaining Viable Supply Sources SFA's.  The largest requirement was in the Maintaining Viable Supply Sources to develop a long-term, reliable source of linear microcircuits.  These devices are critical to maintaining the readiness of front line weapon system electronics.  High priority requirements in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA included additional funding for battery technology, castings and forging manufacturing technology.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) is an R&amp;D effort undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times, assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Subsistence Program (former Combat Rations Program), the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The Subsistence Network objective is to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain with the goals of leveraging the latest technologies, encouraging innovation and modernization, and to maximizing capability and capacity in subsistence. The areas of research includes: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packaging solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. The Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate, Optimize Combat Ration Inspection Costs, and Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project are current short-term projects that will have desired results such as improved processes, enhanced  quality of individual and group combat rations, reduced cost associated with combat rations inpsections, and increased efficiencies, then transition these improvements as applicable to industrial base suppliers and government suppliers. 

The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new material and technological solutions for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The BAA projects have an expected duration of 6-24 months and the government plans to invest up to $18 million during Fiscal Years 2017-2021 for funding research in response to this BAA. The 5 MILMRE Menu Bag Test, a short term study  associated  with the Meals Ready-to-Eat (MRE) Chemical Laminate project was completed in December of 2016.
The work on three Short Term Projects (STP) (Optimize Combat Rations Inspection, Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), and MRE Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project) were extended at the government request in FY16 to fund additional research, development and testing of these projects. Further research and testing on the Optimize Combat Rations Inspection project will identify and test 18 cost savings measures. On the MATS project, a Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization Carrier Tray was designed and tested to optimize the product quality that the MATS can produce. The MRE Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project was extended to examine other subsistence storage and distribution points, including transportation systems and determine the temperature and humidity conditions that subsistence items are exposed to at the locations. The Small Business Innovation Research program Subsistence Topics were released in September 2016 and STPs were reviewed for consideration of Phase I selection in 2017.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Battery Network plan is to establish contract partners through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. A Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups will inform general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain and technology improvement. The plan also includes awarding Phase 2 and 3 projects from DLA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) in advanced battery manufacturing technology. 

The Subsistence Network Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the acquisition of research and development of short term projects was released in July 2016 and will remain open for five years, FY17 – FY21.  A Joint Steering Group made up of government representatives from the Military Services, DLA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Center, and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center will review ongoing projects, identify new areas for investment, assess proposed projects, examine procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA and DoD subsistence needs and requirements.

The DLA Castings R&amp;D Program involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in FY16 soliciting for new R&amp;D projects.  Evaluations will be completed in 2017, with multiple contract awards anticipated for 2017.  The current contracts reached the end of their base period of performance on September 30, 2016, which were also awarded under a competitive BAA in 2011. 
The DLA Forgings R&amp;D projects were awarded through a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Battery Network plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Subsistence Network plan is to execute reductions in cost for shipping, storage, supply chain process, inventory, waste and inspections, as well as reduced lead times for combat ration production, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and “market fresh."

For example, SUBNET will provide the following technical achievements: 1) a microwave-assisted capability to sterilize group-sized entrees and components, packaged in Institutional Sized Pouches (ISP) and Polymeric Trays and 2) identify and produce at least one or more alternate sealant layers that can be used by the rations industry to pack high acidic food products and to ensure uninterrupted supply of MRE rations. 

The Castings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Forgings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation.  

The Additive Manufacturing metric is the number of parts qualified for AM and the lead-time savings achieved to make small quantities of items.  

At least 30% of the completed projects will transition.   

OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  

The Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE completed development and transitioned higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities into full-scale production, further increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned emulation capabilities address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE also initiated new implementations including development of TTL-Compatible CMOS Emulation Capability and development of reverse engineering and design capability for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). It continued developing 350 nanometer Digital Emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.  AME also completed initial development and capability assessments (gap analysis) to support a new major emulation thrust to support Linear Microcircuits beginning in FY2017.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DoD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.

The MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DoD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently, there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

The DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreate the design in contemporary engineering systems.   

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The pilots are developing and demonstrating a digital specification authoring tool, a 3D visualization tool, and technology to streamline the transition of requirements from the Services to DLA.  This technology allows DLA, its customers and suppliers to access, manage and share technical requirements in a common format. 

The DLIR program completed the Strategic Sourcing Tool Project which provided an automated and repeatable process with an accompanying application for rapidly identifying commercially available equivalents for stocked NSNs. 

Additionally, the DLIR program initiated the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Interoperability Project. Currently, technical part data must be manually aggregated and interpreted, and then re-entered and verified within the various systems used by the Services, DLA, and its suppliers, to ensure consistency of all requirements. This project will attempt to semi-automate integration of requirements within each system, improve exchange across systems, and ensure that all participants are made aware of changes that affect these requirements.</r2:Text>

The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)in October 2011.

 The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

PDC's products and services enhance foundational and global services supporting civil-military humanitarian assistance operations by the US Military and US agencies, state agencies, United Nation agencies, ASEAN, national governments, and International/Non-Governmental Organizations (I/NGO).  Foundational and Global Services include projects supporting development, analysis, and delivery of relevant and actionable information.  These activities fall into three categories:  Global Information Services; Anticipatory Sciences and Socio-Economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessment; and Decision Support Platforms and Applications.

Emphasis areas in FY 2016 include:

•  Improve the simplified DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS user interface (a.k.a. "dashboard") for increased ease-of-use and situational awareness, while allowing the system to accommodate "no/low bandwidth" operational mode (enabling better support to mobile platforms, as well as, degraded communications) 
• Extend and enhance mobile computing and situational awareness platform for DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS to include:
   a) cross-device and cross-platform functionality, optimized for touch interface appropriate for mobile devices;
   b) limited "down range" data collection &amp; sharing capabilities (e.g., damage photos, voice memos, etc.)
   c) investigate and implement degraded but functional/operational "off-grid" capabilities
   d) investigate and implement user customization and data import capabilities 
• Enhance DisasterAWARE's social media/network visualization capabilities, in collaboration with partners such as ONR-funded research in the subject matter
•  Extend and enhance Bio Surveillance capabilities in collaboration with Navy and Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA)Bio Surveillance Portal (BSP) Joint Program Executive Office
•  Extend collaboration with DTRA &amp; other data providers in enhancing data fusion capabilities
•  Continue to emphasize and participate jointly- and externally-funded research and application programs to enhance the Center's capabilities and experiences which in turn can be operationalize and applied in direct support of DoD HA/DR and DSCA missions
•  Continue to grow competitive grants and proposals as a means to expand the center’s capabilities, and leverage these new capabilities in support of DoD missions</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Partner Outreach and Collaboration Support (POCS), is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative. The focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment – characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities. GlobalNET currently supports over 74,000 users. The program uses spiral methodology to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.

The GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of  Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate globally 24/7, and supports administrative activities. It provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. POCS implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure, and provides allies and partner countries the ability to team in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program. The program supports PfP coalition Initiatives through the development of distributive collaboration tools to assist U.S./NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities. This support is important to achieve the interoperability/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force. POCS supports internet-based education, collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Add redundant/additional user capacity. This includes expanding the hardware and software to an alternate site to allow additional users to access and use the system concurrently, and be a backup site in the event of a disaster or failure. Because of all of the advanced graphics and expansion of the user base, it is anticipated that we will need this additional capacity.

Ensure that discovery is much easier including adding the capability to refine search results using a keyword based refinement methodology. The amount of data the system will be collecting dictates greater refinement of the search results. In addition, build the capability to allow the users to refine the data by multiple folders.</r2:Text>

The program uses a regional approach to ensure sustainable, leave-behind technology and information sharing procedures. By partnering with other U.S. Government activities, existing assets are leveraged to preserve U.S. investments, avoid duplication of effort between activities, and offer economically prudent solutions to improve information    sharing and achieve U.S. security cooperation goals. Independent Operational Test teams are brought on to ensure that GlobalNET bears independent validation of the development team’s effort. GlobalNET has regional based personnel to assist partners who are not familiar with social collaboration and networking media.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The use of a 3rd party to execute the operational test ensures that the system meets the performance metrics prior to moving to production.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) provides stakeholders of DoD Humanitarian Assistance (HA) programs, including embassy staff, the Combatant Commands, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), and a broad range of Department of Defense and interagency partners, the capability to manage, support, and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funded projects on a web-based map display, in addition to automating report generation, providing tools to coordinate with Interagency and partner nation stakeholders, and perform a variety of analyses.

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training, and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.5 system, which contains more than 16,000 active projects (7,000 of which have been completed) valued at more than $2.3 billion, with a community of over 6,000 users. The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, manage, and evaluate projects intended to assist the Combatant Commands in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information System (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nation’s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events. G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF).

G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.

G-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in four major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY2012-FY2020.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2016 - 2018: An increase in control from $7.861M in FY17 to $14.450M in FY18 is required for development contract award of the fourth release,  Release 4.  New requirements resulted from the Joint Staff J6 Requirements Workshop in Jun 2015 which added additional developmental efforts to the fourth release.  New capabilities will include the ability for conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD, CJCS and MILDEP stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD CAC/PKI Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DOD agencies such as the Deptartment of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user’s organization is easily shared and accessible.  Further improvements will be accomplished on the Cross-Domain Solution (CDS), which will allow the transfer of data/documents from SIPRNet to NIPRNet; the addition of four Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes.

FY18 controls also required for program support for the acquisition, system development test and evaluation, systems engineering, cybersecurity, training development, and cross domain solution implementation fees.  If full FY18 funds are not received, the scope of the Release 4 development contract would be reduced and the acquisition effort would be required beyond FY20.  By not delivering all key capabilities in this final release, severe impacts on the security cooperation user community would occur as the demand signal to use G-TSCMIS increases</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>G-TSCMIS will follow the Rapid IT Acquisition approach as detailed in Section 804 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). G-TSCMIS will initiate an evolutionary and iterative development process for a software-only solution using multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Build Decision in FY2012 and enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G- TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2, and fair and open competition for the Release 3 contract. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards. Release 4 will be completed by a separate contract which will be competed for under fair and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>G-TSCMIS performance is measured in several outcome-based methods. The JC2 Capability Definition Package produced by JS J6 defines the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) to be met. JS J6 also approved specific Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance (MOE/MOP), establishing thresholds and objectives for G-TSCMIS software to meet. Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program. The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational. Additional statistics-based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&amp;V and Developmental tests validate system performance. Major Performers: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for Release 1, 2 and 3 software development.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Security Service (DSS) supports national security and the warfighter through its industrial security oversight, education, and insider threat missions. The DSS is responsible for overseeing the protection of classified information and technologies, and materials in the hands of cleared industry by ensuring compliance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) on behalf of 26 Department of Defense (DoD) components and 31 other U.S. Federal agencies. The NISP serves as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security program to protect classified information and to preserve our Nation’s economic and technological interests. The DSS provides security oversight, counterintelligence coverage and support to approximately 10,000 cleared companies (comprising over 13,000 industrial facilities and about 850,000 cleared contractors), and accreditation of more than 55,000 workstations across multiple and differing classified networks that process classified information and 160 Secure Internet Protocol Router Networks (SIPRNet) nodes.  The DSS NISP oversight role includes responsibility for the majority of the cleared contractors in the United States to include determination, issuance, and oversight of facility security clearances and making determination that contractor employees are eligible to access classified information. The oversight roles include: Conducting required NISP assessments to deter, detect, and identify loss or compromise of classified information and ensure corrective actions; Accrediting classified contractor computer systems to allow industry to perform on classified programs; Completing Foreign Ownership, Control, and Influence (FOCI) mitigation agreements and properly analyzing, evaluating and providing oversight to cleared firms under FOCI agreements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY17 – Amended Budget Request: +2.9M - is required to address emergency warfighter readiness. Funds are needed to continue the development of the National Industrial Security System (NISS). NISS increment 2 will provide critical functionality with a cross domain solution between NIPR and SIPR environments as well as create a SIPR version of the NISS application. This capability bridges the foundational technology gap with the DSS risk based threat approach to oversee the protection of national security information relative to the development of our nation's most critical warfighter programs. In the absence of this capability, DSS will divert resources to legacy systems which require menial data entry rather than meaningful security, counter-intelligence operations and analysis.

FY18 Budget Request: represents a $2.5M decrease from the FY17 PB; the FY18 funding request of $4.6M is required to continue development of the Defense Security Service automated mission system capabilities overseeing the protection of classified information and technologies, and materials in the hands of cleared industry.  Continuous development activities are required to implement the DSS in Transition (DiT) initiatives to facilitate tailored, threat-driven security oversight and prioritized information sharing.  As DoD Security Enterprise continues to evolve, several critical missions have transitioned to DSS, which drives the need for continuous application refresh of existing as well as the acquisition of new advanced technologies in support of new missions.  A critical facet of DiT is Phase II of the National Industrial Security System (NISS) which will leverage event driven SIPR communications amongst DSS Components and external- organizations in lieu of schedule driven compliance.  NCAISS integration with NISS will ensure access to authorized individuals with the need to know are provided with timely and relevant information to respond on anticipated threats.  NCCS, the automated DD-254, will be updated to allow contractors and Government Contracting Authorities (GCAs) to review the full history of submissions for a more holistic view of security requirements and subcontractor relationships.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Security Service manages the Enterprise Security System (ESS) to provide an effective, real-time, security support capability for the Military Departments, DoD Agencies, the NISP, and other Federal Agencies.  In compliance with the Expanded Electronic Government, President’s Management Agenda, and the DoD Enterprise Architecture Framework, ESS is the unified offering of security mission systems which facilitate and automate improved national investigative and adjudicative standards, streamline security processes, and increase DoD community collaboration.

The DSS Mission Information Technology (IT) systems provide critical service to the major DSS mission areas for Industrial Security Oversight and Security Education.  DSS performs this critical function through operation of its mission production systems to include the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), the DSS Gateway, and the Security Training Education and Professionalization Portal (STEPP).  RDT&amp;E for DSS mission systems primarily includes pre-planned product improvements to the applications, researching and improving assured information sharing to better posture systems and networks against vulnerabilities, ensuring self-defense of systems and networks, and safeguarding data at all stages for the DSS to increase efficiencies by providing web-based systems to manage certification and accreditation activities. These IT systems are as follows:   

Office of Designated Approving Authority (ODAA) Business Management System (OBMS).  The OBMS will automate the approval and certification process of cleared industry’s classified information processing security plans and operations.  This will increase mission efficiency by providing a web-based system to manage certification and accreditation activities, provide improved reporting capabilities to support DSS and industry through improved metrics, accreditation timeliness and accuracy and reduce the number of unaccredited systems by providing automated notifications to DSS and industry.  

EFCL:  The eFCL will be a centralized repository for information of facilities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). The eFCL will capture facility information relating to a cleared facility, from the initial processing of the facility clearance, the record decision pertaining to facility clearance request, to include Foreign Ownership Control or Influence (FOCI) information, as well as decommissioning the facility clearance, and capturing the DSS oversight activities.  The eFCL will provide a means for users to submit, update, search, and view facility verification requests.

Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  ISFD is the main DSS mission system that tracks and executes the National Industrial Security Program for DoD and 27 other Federal Executive Agencies of cleared industrial security facilities.  The ISFD provide users with a nationwide perspective on National Industrial Security Program related facilities, as well as, facilities under DSS oversight in the DoD conventional AA&amp;E program. ISFD provides source data for the DoD Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and the Facility Verification Request (FVR) application.

National Industrial Security System (NISS, formerly known as Field Operations System (FOS).  The NISS is slated as the next generation enterprise capability, replacing the Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD).  Additionally, NISS will provide seamless integration of other DSS systems and applications, such as eFCL, OBMS, DD-254, and Mobile Workforce Applications.  NISS will provide DSS with comprehensive enhanced capability to manage its entire mission portfolio.  NISS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data in the hands of field representatives for decision-making.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  

The National Contract Classification System (NCCS).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires a DD Form 254 be incorporated in each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and classification guidance necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required to perform on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation’s classified information is properly safeguarded.


National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) formerly known as Identity Management (IdM).  NCAISS is mandatory for compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program Management Office and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD-NII), Joint Task Force for Global Networks Operations (JTF-GNO) Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 06-02, CTO 07-015, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo 11-11 (M-11-11), directing accelerated use of PKI across the enterprise.  This initiative is designed to enable multiple DSS business systems to have service-accessibility that is controlled through PKI-compliant single sign-on authentication.  Potential expanded use of the NCAISS across the DSS enterprise to provide CAC-based authentication for business support applications to support the SIPRNet and JWICS domains, provide enhanced identity and access control analytics. It will also incorporate any remaining DSS operated application into the DSS NCAISS solution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DITMAC and the systems that support it (DITMAC System of Systems (DSoS)) were scoped to enable processing of reports to DITMAC only. The commencement of operations of some DoD Component Insider Threat Programs in FY16 uncovered a lack of available technical capabilities.  A determination was made to offer the DSoS as the DoDs enterprise platform for insider threat related technical capabilities. The platform expansion requires a complete system re-architecture design to make the technical capabilities more readily accessible by related missions, increasing communication/information sharing, decreasing cyber vulnerabilities, and cost savings each year in software licensing and technical support.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Technical Information Center’s (DTIC) unique mission is to aggregate and fuse science and technology data to provide rapid, accurate, and reliable knowledge to researchers and developers of the next generation of technologies needed to assure our national security. DTIC, a DoD Field Activity, is the DoD’s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and industry-related information.  DTIC also operates DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs) focused on Defense Systems, Cyber Security and Information Systems, and Homeland Defense and Security.

Each year, DoD invests over $12.0 Billion in research, development and procurement of advanced technologies needed to defend our nation.  DTIC preserves the fruits of these costly labors for reuse across the enterprise.  As an efficient and cost-effective steward of technical information, DTIC provides nearly instantaneous answers to researchers seeking state-of-the-art data relevant to their projects.  DTIC regularly prevents duplication of experiments, tests, and prototyping activities because researchers can see what has already been done in their field of effort, even if prior research resulted in a dead end.  Their work can pick up from the point of most recent results.  Using DTIC-created forums, researchers, Warfighters, and industry partners can also rapidly collaborate and connect across the DoD research and engineering (R&amp;E) enterprise.  Finally, DTIC provides a department-level map of R&amp;D activity.  This map gives decision-makers insight into current and past research, highlighting where progress is being made and by whom.  Through the preservation and sharing of the results of billions of dollars of past DoD investments, DTIC increases the return on past investments and accelerates current efforts, saving the Department precious time and dollars.  Through its collaboration tools and outreach to the R&amp;E community, DTIC connects researchers across the lab enterprise, to include researchers and engineers, Warfighters and DoD’s industry partners. 

DTIC’s strategic themes center on customer focus, innovation, operational excellence, and strategic partnering.  In support of these themes, DTIC’s organizational efforts are focused on the following priority areas:
1) Search:  Develop new algorithms that enable our users to quickly discover useful information and to ensure we present the most relevant information.  Expand and enhance our data collections to improve the quality and completeness of the data. 
2) Collaboration:  Provide collaboration platforms for the DoD science and technology community to work together on investments that efficiently deliver solutions to the Warfighter.
3) Access Identity:  Strengthen methods of user authentication through the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) tokens, biometrics and other methods to grant access to recognized, trusted and authorized users.  Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC’s stewardship (protect information access).
4) Data Fusion/Analysis:  Gather information from multiple data sources and provide knowledge products that fuse the disparate data sets into a single view of the life cycle of research.  Present an overarching picture of research investment that enables decision-makers to link multiple efforts with integrated capabilities (employ resources to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across Services).  
5) Cyber Security:  Continue to leverage state-of-the art technologies, processes and practices designed to protect DTIC networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.
6) Data Center Optimization/Cloud:  Migrate services to cloud providers to improve availability, redundancy, and mission flexibility; to reduce time to deliver new capabilities; to save costs; and to enhance cyber security.

DTIC recognizes the need to accomplish its mission while increasing the value of its services and products in an environment of Department-wide budget reductions.  DTIC has reduced its headquarter staffing, physical footprint, civilian personnel and support contractors.  DTIC has restructured the IAC program, and continues to consolidate its data center.  

Despite reduced budgets, DTIC has taken on additional programs, to include its new role in leading the Department in efforts to provide public access to DoD-funded journal articles and research data and increase outreach to industry through DTIC’s Defense Innovation Marketplace.  Moreover, DTIC activities promote citizen science.  Citizen science mobilizes the public to engage in the scientific process and thereby address real-world problems.  Citizen scientists identify research questions, collect and analyze data, interpret results, make new discoveries, develop technologies and applications, and solve complex problems.  DTIC continues to ensure its activities are efficient and effective, meet users’ expectations, and employ industry best practices and standards, while protecting its wealth of information from cyber threats. 

DTIC's restructured Information Analysis Centers (IACs) drive innovation and technological development by anticipating and responding to the information needs of the defense and broader community. The IAC Program Office provides core funding, management and oversight of three IACs, which are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields. The IAC multi-award task order contracts ensure that new research, analysis, and development builds on prior investments and puts to work the best practices of government, industry, and academia. The IAC approach was identified as a "best practice" by the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy in a January 2015 memo wherein he promoted maximum use of the IAC contracts across DoD.  The IACs are structured into three application areas:  Cyber Security and Information Systems, Homeland Defense and Security, and Defense Systems. As part of the Department's acquisition improvement initiatives, the IAC multi-award contracts enhance competition, increase usage of small businesses, and reduce costs. For the last several years, competition inherent in the IAC model has produced savings of 17-25 percent over projected costs, delivering vetted technical expertise to address many of the complex challenges DoD faces. An independent assessment by the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that the IACs improve affordability, productivity, and standardization within defense acquisition programs. Providing the acquisition enterprise access to thousands of industry subject matter experts, DTIC's IACs perform over $1.0 Billion of customer-funded research and prototyping annually.  The results of the work are a rich source of new material in DTIC's information asset collections and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies, e.g., Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security).

This Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations. DTIC focuses on three core mission areas (Collection, Dissemination and IACs) and purchases space and shared services (e.g., human resources (HR); financial management; contracting; IT security; communications; and civilian payroll services) from expert and efficient DoD providers.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Specific changes to the FY 2018 program (a net increase of $8.641 Million from the previous FY 2018 PB Base) are outlined below:

FY 2018 Program Changes:  The Department added $9.055 Million to the FY 2018 DTIC program as a means of resetting the DTIC budget top-line, which had seen a general decline since FY 2011. Absent the requested increase, DTIC would be forced to cease most capability development and to limit efforts on cybersecurity.  These constraints would translate to increased risk on the cybersecurity front and reduced search and retrieval effectiveness, i.e., DoD researchers would incur increased costs and delays in solving technology challenges related to fielding needed warfighting capabilities. 

The funding infusion enables DTIC to keep closer pace with the advance of the state of the art in the science and technology data collections, to refresh outdated and increasingly unsupportable infrastructure, to pursue strategic improvement in tools used by users to search and find needed information, and to begin DTIC’s migration to a cloud host.  Marketplace realities force DTIC to refresh commercial-off-the-shelf technologies supporting information search, storage, and retrieval.  These upgrades are driven by constant evolution of information technology and the reality that vendors enhance or discontinue products as a means of remaining competitive.  This dynamic is not new. The eight previous search engines DTIC deployed, over two decades, have been discontinued by the manufacturer.  In addition, user identity management continues to evolve, and DTIC must keep pace.  In recent years, DTIC has added support for multiple variants of the government Public-Key Infrastructure card (CAC) used by DoD, other Federal Agencies, industry, and other commercial entities.  In the future, we must be ready to accept other identification tokens and biometric identifiers.  Finally, DTIC must find ways to support a growing variety of platforms, devices, and interfaces.  Ten years ago, 99 percent of DTIC users were on Windows/IE desktop platform.  Added funding will allow DTIC to deliver improved search and discovery tools, to simplify access and identity management while increasing cyber security, to provide access on our users’ platform of choice – expanding to deliver to mobile devices (tables and mobile devices), and to migrate to cloud hosting.  Cloud hosting merits special mention because of its promise to allow DTIC professionals to move their focus from infrastructure maintenance to more strategic functions.  Cloud hosting will enable DTIC to be more flexible and agile in meeting our mission objective and increase our ability to innovate.  Use of cloud technologies to support COOP capabilities were delayed by DoD security concerns requiring policy changes for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).  Revised FedRAMP guidance and vendor certification now allow DTIC to reconstitute this critical capability.  The requested additional funding will allow increased collaboration with our partners, and allows further outreach and increased ability to educate and bring awareness to the importance of sharing their results with the community through DTIC.  Funding also promotes increased attendance at scientific conferences and outreach to DoD laboratories, partnership with COCOM S&amp;T staffs, etc., in DTIC’s primary mission to find, collect and ingest S&amp;T data for the purpose of sharing with the larger community.

New funding supports key initiatives to develop and implement new technologies.  These include search and discovery infrastructure; IT COOP reconstitution; data center consolidation and transition to cloud computing; mobile technology; user access and identity management; Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in support of the Executive Order 13556; Public Access to scientific data and publications, in compliance with the Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and Technology Policy; as well as efforts to address a rapidly changing and more sophisticated technological environment.  While DTIC has been planning these initiatives, budget erosion and funding constraints have limited our ability to address these critical tasks.  Without the Department’s FY 2018 funding increase, DTIC will be unable to accomplish these initiatives.  The FY 2018 investment represents a small fraction of the Department’s research and development spending, and will lead to near- and long-term benefits as efficiencies in the information collection and dissemination processes are implemented.  These DTIC initiatives strengthen DoD business practices and result in taxpayer savings.  The FY 2018 funding increase supports the following DTIC programs/initiatives:

- Search and Discovery Infrastructure:  “Search” functionality is the primary way information is shared.  DTIC’s funding shortfall over the past several years has reduced the effectiveness of our search.  Given current funding levels, DTIC has maintained basic functionality, but has not been able to improve and incorporate new search technologies and user interfaces.  This shortfall directly effects users.  It makes them work harder to find the most relevant, applicable, and essential information in DTIC’s collections.  In a practical sense, with the Department spending $12.0 Billion in science and technology funding per year, limited “search” capability drives up costs in the form of duplication of “search” effort, pursuing trails of approaches that have already shown to fail, and inability to find relevant research results.  DTIC must invest in the latest “search” technologies to offer users a complete data picture of DoD-funded research results and reduce the expertise users must hold to find relevant information.

- DTIC IT COOP Reconstitution:  DTIC holds and manages over 4 million records in its collection.  Funding enables DTIC to reconstitute its Continuity of Operations (COOP) systems/servers (mission-essential functions) within the 12-hour timeframe required by Department of Defense Directive 3020.26 if a catastrophic event were to take the primary system off-line.  The investment lessens the risk associated with the extended loss of access to DoD-funded research data and the inability for DTIC to collect new research results.  Funding supports the analysis of alternatives, system architecture, cyber risk management framework documentation/accreditation, system engineering, software development, testing, hardware procurement, software licenses, storage, and bandwidth.

- Data Center Consolidation/Cloud Computing Transition:  The Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) directs the reduction in physical servers and the consolidation of data centers.  DTIC has reduced the number of its physical servers by 60 percent and moved to a virtualized server environment.  Outsourcing to the cloud will enable DTIC to focus more resources on our core mission--delivering information through innovative applications, rather than maintaining an IT platform.  DTIC information services will become more flexible and innovative, shortening the gap between testing and implementation of DoD weapon systems.  To operate effectively in cloud environments, DTIC must reengineer much of its information pipeline.  The funding request supports the analysis of alternatives, system architecture, system engineering, cyber risk management, necessary architecture and software modifications, services costs (servers, storage, bandwidth, management, etc.), testing, and software licensing. 

- Mobile and Emerging Platform technology:  DTIC serves a diverse audience.  DoD users, industry partners, and academic researchers have moved from a traditional desktop Windows Internet Explorer (IE) environment to an array of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile), operating systems, and browsers.  To remain relevant, DTIC must ensure products and interfaces support these new devices.  If new technology is not pursued, large portions of DTIC’s user community will be lost.  FY 2018 funding supports the analysis of alternatives, metrics, software development, testing, hardware, licenses, cyber security, and Risk Management Framework (RMF)/accreditation.

- Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  In September 2016, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA, specifically the Information Security Oversight Office) released final guidance to execute the CUI effort throughout the Executive Branch.  This guidance supported the President‘s Executive Order 13556, issued in November 2008, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).  The EO directed the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as the CUI Executive Agent to standardize the way the Executive Branch handles information (excluding information that is classified).  Distribution of information outside of the DoD is only allowable when documents are marked to the new CUI standards, including categories that will require portion marking.  The term “Controlled Unclassified Information” (“CUI”) will start being used by the Department in 2017, phasing out the term “For Official Use Only” (“FOUO”).  As the Department’s unique central repository and distribution source for technical information, DTIC must modify their collection, storage, and distribution systems to recognize and properly handle new marking and distribution standards.  Lacking establishment of these new systems and proper CUI marking, the DoD would lose much of its ability to share material with other Federal Government agencies, industry partners, and allies.  Added funding supports the initiation of steps needed to support new CUI standards, namely:  policy development, system requirements planning, cyber security assessments, software prototyping, and development of user training.

- Public Access:  The Executive Office of the President (EOP)/Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a memorandum directing Federal agencies that spend more than $100 Million per year on research and development (R&amp;D) to develop plans to support increased access to the results of research funded by the Federal government.  As the Department’s central repository of DoD-funded technical information, DTIC was tasked with implementing the infrastructure to collect and disseminate journal articles, manuscripts and digital data that are the result of DoD-funded research.  In FY 2017, DoD issued new policy to internal researchers to develop data management plans and submit authors’ manuscripts for journal articles.  Funding allows DTIC to continue work with DoD Labs; educate and train researchers of new requirements; develop policy for external researchers (contracts and grants), submission compliance measures, and user facing tools; and evaluate and prototype the handling of data sets.  Supporting data sets bring with it a range of complex issues caused by the variety of sciences and their output, and the sheer sizes that can grow to petabytes.

FY 2018 Service Requirements Review Board (SRRB) Reduction:  $.592 Million reduction to the DTIC program is the result of the Department’s recent service contract downsizing effort.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DTIC is responsible for developing, coordinating and enabling a strong scientific and technical information (STINFO) program for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) and the DoD scientific &amp; technical (S&amp;T) enterprise. In this role, DTIC sets policy for scientific and technical information (STI) exchanges for the research and engineering (R&amp;E) community. DTIC’s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions to safeguard national security, export control, and intellectual property rights.

Recognizing the common elements across budget justification documents, progress reports, completed work reports, studies, and journal articles, DTIC is mapping relationships to enable users to access the life cycle of research projects from planning to final results. DTIC employs information technology to verify and validate information submitted and improve user confidence in DoD research documentation.

DTIC is leading the Department’s efforts to implement public access to published journal articles, and digital data from research funded by taxpayers. In this role, DTIC is actively working with partners across the Services, components, other federal agencies and publishers.  These ongoing efforts directly complement and support the Department’s objectives associated with Citizen Science.  Consistent with the Administration’s (Office of Management and Budget) emphasis for open standards and machine readable formats, DTIC initiated the transition from paper and Portable Document Format (PDF) based information to Web Service Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard data submission and machine readable delivery. DTIC partnered with the OSD Comptroller to collect investment account budget justification documentation in XML and embed this XML in PDF for justification books delivered to Congress. DTIC employed this same technology in collecting S&amp;T progress reports from the Services and Agencies, and Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) data from industry. DTIC is planning the migration of its completed technical reports collection to the same open standards, i.e., machine readable formats.  

Through the use of commercial search technology, DTIC provides search capability that links its knowledge of the DoD domain and metadata to support both text searches and data mining. DTIC continually works to enable additional features within our search capabilities and from commercial partners to improve information discovery and relevance.

DoD conducts science and technology research via the following means:  60+ labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), DTIC’s Information Analysis Centers (IACs), and other contracts and grants.  Spanning over a dozen distinct priority area communities of interest, the results of this work is available through DTIC’s web-based R&amp;E Gateway.  To protect this information, DTIC regulates access through a database of registered users.  In addition, DTIC uses commercial software in compliance with DoD Identity Management Standards to provide instant authenticated access to users of either the Common Access Card (CAC), External Certificate Authority (ECA), or Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  DTIC’s unclassified assets, tools and community interaction capabilities foster innovation, competition and identification of solutions in an access-controlled environment.

Focus on User Communities and Distribution Points:  DTIC supports user communities on the network where they work, i.e., NIPRNET, SIPRNET and public internet, and uniquely provides access controls within unclassified and classified material to protect intellectual property in our search, distribution, and collaboration tools.

- DoD’s RDT&amp;E Enterprise:  As a Field Activity to ASD(R&amp;E)/AT&amp;L, DTIC’s priority is the RDT&amp;E enterprise, hosting information assets and tools on the NIPRNET (the primary network for the community).

- Warfighter:  Improving coordination between the acquisition enterprise and warfighter communities, DTIC hosts a subset of information assets and tools on the SIPRNET. DTIC is working to expand the availability of science and technology (S&amp;T) information, to include Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D), on the SIPRNET.  DTIC is continuing its efforts to establish parity of information and capabilities on applications hosted on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET platforms.

- Industry and Academia via Public Internet:  Engaging industry outside the NIPRNET firewall to support acquisition improvement initiatives and encourage the introduction of innovation, DTIC hosts unclassified public information and tools accessible to all users on the Internet. The Public Access initiative adds importance to the public distribution point, to encourage technology transfer of basic and public research to the private sector, and to give an economic boost to small businesses that can use that data to provide new applications to consumers.

Summary.  DTIC protects and preserves DoD’s multi-billion dollar investment in research, which empowers the acquisition enterprise through innovative tools, information systems, and decision support capabilities. The efficiency benefits can be enormous.  Each 1 percent increase in the reuse of S&amp;T efforts produces over $100 Million in savings that can be redirected.  Those savings come from elimination of inefficient redundancy (and unnecessary delays), increased community interaction, and ultimately, a more capable military.  DTIC is uniquely positioned to support and to ensure the value of DoD’s R&amp;D portfolio is fully realized.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs), established under DoD Instruction 3200.14, serve as a vital resource in providing timely, relevant information directly to users when and where it is needed. IACs serve as a bridge between the warfighter and the Acquisition/Research community, providing essential technical analysis and data support to a diverse customer base, to include the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, and the Military Services. IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies. The IACs create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements. IAC operations directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key CCMD operational issues such as cyber security, unmanned aerial vehicle visual/audible signature reduction, and improvements to the ballistic resistance of body armor.

The IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies. In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing scientific and technical information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges.  Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Technical Area Task (TAT) order processing, Basic Center Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense R&amp;E community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for shared direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations, with OSD-COMPT and Office of General Counsel concurrence.  This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&amp;E community at large.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides funding for the Management Headquarters (HQ) element of the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), a DoD Field Activity to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)/AT&amp;L).  The PE supports personnel compensation for HQ-assigned civilians, along with related administrative support costs.  This second DTIC PE, established in FY 2017, is designed to track activities deemed as headquarters functions, with no operational efficiencies or enhancement to mission.

The PE supports the following HQ functions and mission essential activities critical to the success of DTIC’s business operations, and mandated by law or regulation: 

- Activity leadership, strategic planning, and Front Office support staff.
-- The front office staff (6 authorizations) represents a small component of this PE.  Most of the specialized functions and skill-sets described below are centralized activities within the PE, yet support the larger organization and its employees.  These activities were consolidated as a means to improve efficiencies throughout DTIC, and are essential to the operation of DTIC’s primary PE 0605801KA.
-- Reductions to DTIC’s HQ staffing levels continue, reducing civilian full time equivalents (FTEs) below FY 2017 levels. 
- Financial Management and Comptroller.  Provides integrated resource management at the Agency level to obtain, control, and execute budget and manpower authorities to support the organization's mission requirements.  Develops and prepares agency budget documents and exhibits for submission to both OSD and Congress.
-- Accounting support to DTIC’s mission operations; partners with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to present accurate financial reporting and Fund Balance with Treasury. 
-- Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) activities and oversight in compliance with the Department’s audit goals, objectives, and milestones.
- Human Resources (HR) Liaison Support.  Provides the DTIC enterprise with payroll processing and “Hire to Retire” mission support; oversees and organizes employee training, professional development, and certification programs (e.g., Acquisition, Financial Management, and IT programs).
-- Coordinates recruitment placement and classification action for the mission areas; liaison to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for HR servicing and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) program maintenance.
- Mandatory Records Management compliance activities and administration programs.
- IT Management/Chief Information Officer (CIO).  Collects, analyzes, and reports information necessary to effectively and efficiently manage enterprise IT resources; CIO functions are performed in compliance with DoD-CIO guidance, instructions and mandates. 
- IT Help Desk/Local Area Network (LAN).  Office automation supports desktop computing customers; resolves IT-related equipment or system incidents; provides assured system and network availability, info delivery, and secure IT solutions to support current and future business and mission requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Basic Research funds research across physical, material, engineering, computational, and life sciences directed toward greater knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of observable phenomena associated with weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

DTRA's Basic Research is the Nation’s only basic research program solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD).  It provides for the discovery and development of basic knowledge by research performers comprised from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry. This investment helps motivate the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions, advancing the body of CWMD knowledge, and improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts. These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a basic research program under DoD’s Chemical and Biological Defense Program. 

Each year, program and technical managers conduct formal assessments of the portfolio, leveraging deep Science and Technology (S&amp;T) expertise within DTRA, as well as from the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group, independent external panel reviews, and other CWMD-focused stakeholders. This coordination facilitates unique, CWMD-relevant basic research while eliminating unintended duplication of effort in the broader defense S&amp;T community.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project, as the nation’s only basic research solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) CWMD mission areas.  This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.  This Initiative aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.  The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: Accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  This project solicits, coordinates, and conducts basic research aligned to five Thrust Areas.  Each Thrust Area Manager coordinates an independently reviewed portfolio of research projects selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation. 

Thrust Area 1:  Science of WMD Sensing and Recognition.  This thrust area explores novel methodologies to investigate physical properties of sensitive materials as they interact with phenomena associated with WMD, such as ionizing radiation.  This research provides the basis for developing capabilities to discover the presence, identity, and quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant, in turn providing the means to develop advanced forensic applications that enable detection, characterization, and attribution, particularly in post-detonation radiative environments.

Thrust Area 2:  Network Sciences.  This thrust area explores analytical, numerical, computational, and other mathematical approaches to model and simulate the behavior of layered, interdependent physical networks affected by WMD.  This interdisciplinary, theoretical research provides the basis for developing advanced algorithms and analytical frameworks that accurately predict and depict WMD environments by characterizing impacts and vulnerabilities, representing root causes of cascading failures, and assessing robustness, resilience, restoration, and recovery in varying degrees of disruption.

Thrust Area 3:  Science for Protection.  This thrust area employs experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to explore and understand the causal mechanisms and deleterious characteristics of ionizing radiation and the tolerance, response, and resistance characteristics of affected sensitive electronic systems and microorganisms.  This research provides the basis for engineering resilient systems and technologies, offering radical improvements to the survivability and performance of mission-critical electronic equipment and personnel in hostile radiative environments.

Thrust Area 4:  Science to Defeat WMD.  Through experimentation and computational modeling and simulation, this thrust area investigates phenomena associated with penetration physics, shock propagation and turbulence dynamics, and researches novel energetic and reactive materials for defeat of targets containing WMD.  This research provides the scientific foundation necessary to develop advanced solutions for:  (1) Accessing WMD in hardened and deeply buried infrastructure, (2) defeating (non-nuclear) targets with minimal unintended collateral effects, and (3) predicting post-detonation (non-nuclear) weapon effects.

Thrust Area 5:  Science to Secure WMD.  This thrust area leverages a wide range of scientific and mathematical disciplines to explore phenomena related to physical, biological, and chemical interactions with radioactive particles and waveforms.  This research provides the technical basis for development of innovative, unconventional applications to improve security oversight and control of WMD materials and facilities and to improve monitoring and surveillance systems related to arms control and nonproliferation.

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 balances near term operational needs with future technical developments and capabilities.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the relative impact of the decrease in FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Researchers discovered that cognitive impairment from radiation exposure occurs at much lower levels, and on later timelines than previously thought.  New data rewrites the exposure/protection guidelines in consideration of after-battlefield effects.
- Researchers developed a new model to characterize and assess power grid responses to WMD events on a country-wide scale.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Science Foundation, and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy have awarded research grants based on these results.
- Researchers found the use of micro-vesicles harvested from normal adult stem cells could reverse the effects of radiation-induced cognitive impairment. The finding has potential to lead to a new class of therapeutics to counteract battlefield radiation exposure.
- Researchers developed a novel spectroscopic technique to differentiate isotopic signatures in molecules.  The findings suggest shortened timelines for developing capabilities to perform rapid in-field isotopic analysis of nuclear debris, critical for nuclear forensics.
- Researchers developed a new method to reduce noise 100x below the classical limit for atom interferometric sensors; published in Nature.  The findings show the potential to greatly improve gravimetric sensors for radiological/nuclear search and tunnel detection.
- Researchers developed new low-noise contacts for solid-state radiation detectors by taking advantage of a photon-exchange effect.  This research has the potential to eliminate the need for cooling, leading to the development of field ready, high-resolution radiological/nuclear detectors.  This research has transitioned to Iljin Radiation Engineering for further development.
- A DTRA-funded researcher was chosen as a DoD National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellow and another researcher was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers.  These prestigious DoD and Presidential awards showcase the quality of DTRA-funded principal investigators working within the CWMD science and technology mission space.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Sciences and Applications project develops concepts and technologies in the areas of high-speed information processing, modeling and simulation, signal detection, and data-driven decision analysis in support of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) technical reachback teams.  This project develops and maintains continuously improving collaborative architectures and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) modeling &amp; simulation codes that drive an integrated suite of decision support tools serving the Combatant Commands, other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, and national and international Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) partners.  This effort also provides management and support of the Threat Reduction Advisory Committee through FY 2017.  The committee is a senior-level federal advisory committee, which provides independent expert advice on CWMD to the Secretary of Defense through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Matters.  This effort also funds the Next Generation Nuclear Professionals (NextGen) activities.  This outreach effort encourages collaboration between those currently in the nuclear field and those who are considering entering that field.  The effort consists of conferences, working groups, a debate series, publications, international outreach, an online presence, and a Nuclear Scholars effort.

The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the net effect of increased investment in hazard and effects characterization and technology-driven WMD threat forecasting and decreased investment in advanced analytics and operations analysis, modeling, and simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These forensics technologies also enable the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and its trusted partners to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats, including weapons and material and enablers to their acquisition and development.  In accordance with Department of Defense Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the U.S. Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&amp;D).  As the central NTNF R&amp;D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions.

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in prompt nuclear effects exploitation for attribution.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to increased investment in nuclear device characterization for forensics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities.  The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project.  On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.

The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in CWMD weapons technologies.  The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 supports the funding profile for CWMD weapons technologies’ planned activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event.  Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment.  This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration.  This project also supports international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group.  The Human Survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.  

The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the net effect of increased investment in system vulnerability and assessment, nuclear weapons effects experimentation, and nuclear technology analysis support and decreased investment in radiation-hardened nano-electronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering WMD Test and Evaluation project provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing.  The test bed facility provides structured and systematic end-to-end test event planning, preparation, management, execution, and data analysis.  The test bed offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management.  The facility leverages fifty years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD.  Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the Department of Defense (DoD) and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.  

The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in environmental compliance, the WMD national test bed, and test and technology support to revitalize DTRA’s CWMD test and evaluation capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

(DTRA’s) Basic Research Program to identify promising emerging science with potential to be matured into CWMD technologies. The advancement of technology
and science into applied technology development efforts focuses upon increasing the stability and utility of mid- to long-term, moderate risk but high payoff science,
and emerging technologies for transition to other DTRA applied technology programs. This effort serves as the bridge between the bench scientist and the applied
technologist.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Advanced Technology Development program element funds the development and testing of subsystems and components for integration into prototype systems with the potential to transition into mature, state-of-the-art WMD surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification capabilities.

The Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives as well as with Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction which is established annually by DTRA.  The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) Efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&amp;T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The project performs continuous modeling of ad hoc computational analyses on the consequences of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) in consultation with military and civilian planners, warfighters, and first responders and leverages research performed by the Project on Advanced Systems and Concepts for CWMD at the Naval Postgraduate School. The project also supports international CWMD cooperation by developing technologies and concepts suitable for foreign release.

The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to decreased investment in hazard and effects characterization and technical reachback support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two research areas: (1) Countering WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation Research and Development is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development/acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; (2) USSOCOM CWMD-T Support develops concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize operations and activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Forensics Technologies project develops, integrates, tests, and demonstrates post-detonation nuclear forensics systems providing accurate, rapid, and reliable means to collect, analyze, and evaluate prompt data and debris from a nuclear or radiological event in support of exploitation and attribution efforts.  These forensic capabilities enable the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and its trusted partners to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats, including weapons and material, and enablers to their acquisition and development.  In accordance with DoD Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the U.S. Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&amp;D).  As the central NTNF R&amp;D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions.  NTNF R&amp;D supports advanced research in the following areas: (1) Prompt nuclear effects exploitation for attribution; (2) nuclear device characterization for forensics; (3) nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution.

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in monitoring and verification technology, device characterization for forensics, and materials exploitation for attribution.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the relative impact of reduction in FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability.  Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the relative impact of reductions in FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

HAMMER provides a concept demonstration for penetrating weapons which mitigate collateral contamination effects through: low overpressure, minimal target structure damage, and no aerosolization.
- Conducted Modular Autonomous CWMD System Increment A (MACS-A) Risk Reduction Test 2, which demonstrated increased supervised autonomous technologies addressing multiple payload configurations to enhance combating WMD and included navigation in an underground facility in extreme obscurants with limited communications.  MACS-A addresses the ability to enable plug-and-play technologies as a force multiplier.
- Transitioned initial MACS-A concept to U.S. Army for further development.
- Demonstrated a highly resilient weapon design that survived two separate shock environments at different velocities, enabling detailed prototype work on other sub-systems with a known shock environment to meet TRL 6 specifications prior to transition.  Additionally, the body of knowledge resulting from the construction of high fidelity targets (softer than cement) to meet specifications of analogous high fidelity soil-codes, penetration tools, and build properties will serve many communities of interest investigating earth penetrating weapons and ground sensor designs.
- Continued development of access denial or denial-of-use technologies for CWMD applications.
- Continued functional defeat system development, testing, and demonstration.</r2:Text>

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.  The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The Radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  The Human Survivability supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.

The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.  

The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the transition of nuclear effects modeling applied research efforts to advanced technology development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions emerging technologies enabling efforts to find, characterize, assess, and plan for the defeat of WMD threats. There are two core research efforts in this project. The WMD battlespace awareness effort provides warfighters with capabilities to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats. This effort develops and integrates sensing technologies with multi-mission Unmanned Aerial System payloads. The Countering WMD (CWMD) weapons effects effort develops modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations.

The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in WMD reconnaissance technology and weapons effects and planning tools. The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to increased investment in weapons effects and planning tools technology development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to a relative impact of increased investment in FY 2016 for crane operations and build-out of the test bed structures at the Nevada National Security Site for sensor development and testing.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to increased investment in the Special Test Bed for missile defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Target Assessment Technologies project develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates, and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) target assessment and functional defeat.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets and to (2) assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the projected completion of the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize, and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to decreased investment reflecting the transition of the previously mentioned high-priority sensor technology and supporting algorithms to the combatant commands.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.

The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to re-phasing of program activities to FY 2018 and FY 2019.  The increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the net effect of re-phasing of program activities from FY 2017, a realignment of RDT&amp;E to O&amp;M in support of station operations for NACT, and a realignment of funds from DTRA to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD (AT&amp;L)) for support services necessary to meet Congressional oversight responsibilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrated legacy capabilities and facilitated data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provided near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between the Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.  This toolset migrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) decision support capabilities. The framework was the only operational chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) framework in the world that provided capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by international, national, state, and local authorities.  

The decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JIAMDO-Core (FY17):  $5.3 million is required to address emergency warfighting readiness requirements. Joint Regional IAMD Capability Mix (JRICM) II is a DepSecDef and JROC directed Regional IAMD study, directing the Joint Staff, Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO), in coordination with USSTRATCOM, USCYBERCOM, Intelligence Communities, Agencies and Services to assess the impact of emerging non-kinetic capabilities to supplement regional IAMD.

JIAMDO-Homeland:  Program development and management were handed off to the Air Force. JIAMDO retains only requirements and integration oversight responsibilities not requiring program funding.  

JIAMDO-Nimble Fire:  Increased funding for FY 2018 will be used to hold two large Nimble Fire events in support of U.S. Fleet Forces Command, USPACOM, USSTRATCOM and USEUCOM.  Additionally, funds will be used to improve Electronic Warfare, Multi-spectral Environment, Advanced Capability Model, and Space Warfare.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

Across all four events executed in FY 2016, Nimble Fire project resulted in significant cost-avoidance for the Department and Services through identifying real-world system issues, supporting live venues, and providing the backbone simulation environment for other users.  Major accomplishments include:
•	Identifying real-world issues on multiple systems including E-2, E-3, Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS), and F-15. Issues fed back to program offices to take corrective action
•	Impact of advanced capabilities on tactical fight (details classified)
•	Human-machine and Link-16 network challenges associated with executing integrated fire control kill chains
•	Potential benefits of future sensors, weapons and capabilities (e.g., next generation jammer (NGJ), airborne early warning)
•	Concepts of employment (CONEMPS) for 4th and 5th generation fighters employing with F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to inform Service tactics, techniques and procedures (e.g., Air Force 3-1)

The Joint Concepts Program assists the CJCS in the formulation of “best military advice” by providing a long-term (out to 20 years) vision of how the Joint Force will be developed to respond to the future operating environment characterized by trans-regional, multi-domain, and multi-functional challenges.    Key deliverables include:  The Joint Operating Environment (JOE); Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO); identification, development, and implementation of Joint Concepts necessary to address future operating environment challenges and achieve objectives of the National Military Strategy (NMS); and CJCSI 3010 Guidance for Development and Implementation of Joint Concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Active implementation included 14 Joint Concepts into Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) processes during FY 2016 resulting in 3 studies, 5 Capabilities-Based Assessments (CBA), 14 DOTMLPF-P Change Requests (DCR), 1 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), 3 Capability Development Documents (CDD), 1 Capability Production Document (CPD), and development of 3 Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) courses. The final update for the Joint Operational Access Concept Implementation Plan was signed May 2016 signaling that appropriate DOTMLPF-P processes are developing capabilities critical to addressing Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) challenges.  18 legacy concepts were approved by the Director of the Joint Staff for archival.  The CJCSI 3010 was approved Aug 2016 with improved terminology and process descriptions to guide joint concept development and implementation.  Initiated the pilot year of the DepSecDef directed Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund (WLIF) program, resulting in 13 OSD-funded projects designed to spur and support warfighting field experiments, demonstrations, and operational user input to develop innovative capabilities, and new operational and organizational constructs to address emerging warfighter challenges.</r2:Text>

This complex and multi-variant task requires modernized technologies that must provide integrated information by linking authoritative force structure data (derived from the GFM DI Organizational Servers) to C2 data (resident in GFM mission applications). The Joint Staff Operations Directorate is responsible for GFM Allocation and is the Functional Manager of the GFM mission applications. Accordingly, the Joint Staff Operations Directorate will employ a joint strategy for efficiently fulfilling Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.

The DoD must quickly transition from legacy systems that promulgate data disparity across the Defense enterprise in order to meet National military objectives that have evolved from large force scenarios to operations that include small-to-full scale activities. As stated in both the NSS and NMS, our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic means. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to seamlessly exchange information in a manner that keeps pace with globally changing threats to rapidly and accurately accomplish force sourcing activities to support SecDef allocation decisions. TJS is mandated to utilize the Service Org Server (OS) EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces. Key deliverables include incrementally developed, operationally realistic capability enhancements focused on Resource-Informed Planning and GFM sourcing functionality required by JROCMs, the Capability Development Document (CDD) for GFM DI; Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Definition Package (CDP); Joint Operation Planning Process (JOPP) and Assessment CDP; and Force Planning &amp; Deployment Planning/Execution CDP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This GFM DI effort within the Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) family of programs: will immediately streamline the SECDEFs "Forces for Unified Commands" memorandum Assignment Tables. RDT&amp;E efforts for Assignment and Apportionment functions ended in FY 2015 with the declaration of the Automated Global Force Management Tool (AGT) Full Operation Capability (FOC). In order to complete the GFM DI tasks, efforts must begin as early as possible to ensure all GFM DI planned milestones, reflected in Section E, are realized and thereby enable a Global Visibility Capability. GFM applications managed by the Joint Staff are used by the JSAS family of programs. This effort to fund critical upgrades is a precondition to GFM DI EFS Integration.</r2:Description>

This approach is essential in a budget constrained environment to fulfill the DoD CIO "DoD Cloud Way Forward" focused on service-oriented architecture that flattens the legacy "Silos of Databases" paradigm by leveraging decentralized infrastructure services. It will enable DoD CIO foundational IT changes with enhanced cybersecurity that provides information sharing within the Joint Command and Control mission partner environment without redundant or duplicative resources. The strategy will result in initial incremental development of the Joint Force Capability Catalog (JFCC) virtual application with a Force Element Inventory Predictive Analysis Tool (FEI PAT) utilizing dynamic force visibility that provides timely, accurate and dynamic data representing U.S. Forces in motion for the 34 GFM leading indicators and Combatant Commanders initial force requirements as identified in the NMS priority OPLANS.  The Initial Operating Capability (IOC) will be achieved by first aggregating the Service Org Server data into the Global Laydown Server to link Service generated Organization Unique Identifiers (OUIDs) for  force elements identified to establish the Joint C2 relationships to the Allocation process (OPCON and TACON Links). This will provide the capability to establish the OUID/ Unit Identification Code (UIC) linkages in Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDDs), then map them to GFM allocation information (Force Tracking Number [FTN], Request for Forces [RFF], Deployment Order/Line Number [DEPORD/LNR]), and Assignment of the Forces For Unified Commands</r2:Text>

The GLS algorithms will enable the GFM mission applications to present meaningful information required for timely and accurate decision making to assist the Chairman in providing best military advice. The JFCC will serve as a user interface that uses the GLS algorithms to streamline operations planning and GFM execution in support of CCMD Warfighter requirements. The FY 2018 strategy will focus on a Unit Type Capabilities registration functionality within the JFCC that will unify the unit-based readiness and unit type reporting process by obtaining on-hand forces (personnel and equipment) via the EFS (GFM DI) standard format. The FY 2018 incremental development of the JFCC virtual application and associated dynamic force visibility will provide the true inventory of force availability based on Service employable entities (Unit Types) and sustainability factors, to enable the use of on-hand Service Force capabilities identified down to the Service-defined lowest deployable entities (Unit Types) for executive decision making and GFM mission execution.</r2:Text>

This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management, and are measured by the following:

(1)	Meet IOC that enables rapid generation of GFM decision-making information for Policy-makers and warfighting Combatant Commands based on authoritative Service force capability, readiness, availability and current employment data.

(2)	Reducing the manual process of assembling Capability, Readiness, Availability, Employment (CRAE) data, is the first step to providing enhanced force management decision-making. Mining this data is currently a labor-intensive, time-consuming process and significantly impedes rapid response capabilities. Automating this data aggregation requires EFS Data services and Web Service Interfaces supporting a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog (JFCC) as described in the EFS Capability Package (CP) and is critical to operationalizing the force structure data and achieve GFM DI Next Steps Allocation.

(3)	Services, CCMDs, Joint Staff and OSD will be able to efficiently manage (collect and analyze) force generation data supporting GFM in far less time than the current process, and with an authoritative common view of the sourcing-to-employment tracking of forces. This is accomplished by the automated linking of the Organization Unique Identifier (OUID) attributes from the GFM DI Org Servers (OS) to the Unit Identification Code (UIC) resident in JOPES.

(4)	The JFCC will enable the rapid generation of information when making time-sensitive decisions and allow a Joint Planner to inculcate the association of standard and consistent force structure instance data and consistently applied data "types" with force structure data referenced over time in the GFM sourcing solution generation and deployment planning, execution, and distribution processes.

(5)	Ability to meet the VCJCS guidance to meet the GFM DI Full Operating Capability (FOC) by FY 2020 for GFM Allocation.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Joint Simulation System (JSS)

- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)

- USSTRATCOM SPACE CYBER

- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and SOF joint training and enabling capabilities that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint collective training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. The enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program will focus efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS), consisting of the Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS), provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO, and multinational partners. The Joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS’s intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners by continuing limited investments to ensure JTLS and JCATS remain relevant and provide reliable, low-cost, small footprint, distributed, and deployable joint training solutions. 
 
JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD T2 JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, Interagency training; OSD required training (externally funded): and, administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (SEJPME) program.  JKO expends research, development test and evaluation (RDTE) funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance specific aspects of the training capability as required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.

USSTRATCOM CYBER: The USSTRATCOM CYBER funding provided architecture and analysis support to Space Security and Defense Program (SSDP) and the JOINT SPACE OPERATIONS CENTER (JICSpOC) through Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&amp;A); Trade-Off Analysis; Concept Development; Scenario Development; and Military Utility Analysis.

Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and Cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements, and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands to train as they operate.  The net funding increase from FY 2016 through FY 2018 represents planned growth and internal reprogramming decisions to accelerate development of a cloud-enabled joint training environment.  The funding requested continues to modernize joint training capabilities into a single integrating architecture for Joint Training that is aligned to the DoD Chief Information Officer IT mandates.  Funding supports the development of cloud-enabled modular training application services.  Program intent is to reduce dependence on touch labor, and mitigate the impact of reductions in operation and sustainment funding.  Focus must be maintained to deliver operationally relevant training environments and respond to changes in global security landscape and the warfighter’s operational environment.  JNTC enables the Department of Defense to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices. In FY 2018, this investment continues expanding capabilities and access for Service and Combatant Command trainers to plan and execute joint training.  Funds support improved relevance and realism of training by providing capabilities that replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>JNTC provides the technical standards, architecture (blueprint), and development processes required to integrate/link joint training programs.  The Joint Training Environment is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes, and accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating specific actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience.  This enhances the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  Funding in this account supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  The resulting capabilities enable selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command Headquarter levels.  The funding supports modernization of the Joint Training Environment (JTE) to increase warfighter access to semi-automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE) through web-based, modular cloud capabilities. 

The Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the Joint Force to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed JLVC enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and CJCS High Interest Training Issues identified in the Chairman’s Annual Training Guidance.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DoD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  JKO is tasked to develop a DoD enterprise-wide, Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products, services, and enabling training technology.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD (P&amp;R) CE2T2 Program Goals &amp; Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Issues, Joint Staff training priorities, and JKO Stakeholders (Combatant Commands, Services, and Combat Support Agencies, Interagency, and Multinational) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve all components of the Joint Content Management Architecture including:  

• JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit. JKO LCMS is necessary to develop, host and deliver JKO courses and track/report students’ progress, completions and survey results more effectively and efficiently. JKO LCMS extends web-based, distributed access to mission-critical joint training requirements. There are currently over 2.7 million registered users of the JKO LCMS.

• Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and prerequisite JKO courses enable blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises that augment the Joint Event Learning Cycle and in meeting combatant commanders exercise objectives.

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E development efforts are evaluated based on performance metrics.  This ensures the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) capabilities development effort synchronizes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to: time, money, realism, and fidelity and are defined below.

• Time – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to prepare and execute training more timely than current capabilities allow?
• Cost – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to prepare and execute training at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow?
• Realism – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to create a training environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow?
• Fidelity – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to create more detailed capabilities in the training environment than current capabilities allow?
• The Navy will produce one Navy Training Baseline (NTB) software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) consistent with approved requirements and contractual requirements and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate NTB enhancements in accordance with requirements.
• For JSAF, Joint Simulation BUS (JBUS) reliability, scalability, and tactical control, the Navy will continuously update the Common Operational Picture (COP) during large scale JLVC exercises.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Applying small incremental amounts of investments to Department of Defense (DOD), other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Small incremental co-investments with DOD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allow USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Technology development needs in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via agency announcements and calls for white papers.  Sub-projects within the SOF Technology Demonstration effort include:

•  SOF Technology Development Sub-Project:  This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.

•  Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Sub-Project:  TTL funds Applied Research projects identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL applies leading edge nanotechnology, biometric and biotechnology, and chemistry which is directed towards the development of revolutionary tags, taggants, sensors, communications, and data processing.

•  Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Technology Development (project S200) conducts rapid prototyping and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It is a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in operationally relevant environments with Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the SOF Special Technology Development efforts include:  

  •  Special Operations Forces Special Technology Sub-Project.  This sub-project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.

  • Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technologies Sub-Project.  TTL funds SOF unique ATDs identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL rapidly prototypes and expeditiously transitions projects from laboratory to acquisition Programs of Record/operational use to address SOF capability deficiencies.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts rapid prototyping of information and broadcast system technology.  Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media &amp; Product Selection, Distribution &amp; Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  

Broadcast and Dissemination Modernization.  Develops emerging technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities for MISO forces. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advance Technology Demonstrations and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended systems, especially in denied areas; focused/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of long-loiter broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environment; and technologies that automate and improve planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC) provides for efforts to develop and integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery/signals intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. SAFC applies focused Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&amp;D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

New AEW kit incorporates waterproofed hardware, multiple signal sets, and can be flown aboard a Puma I or Puma II UAS air vehicle.

•  Open System Auto-Pilot:  Successfully replaced proprietary Puma I auto-pilot with low cost, commercial, non-proprietary device; aircraft flew well with no observed anomalous flight characteristics.  Began effort to replace Scan Eagle auto-pilot with the same commercial auto-pilot used in Puma I; expected to fly in FY17.

•  Wi-Fi Exploitation Capability:  Flew down-sized space, weight and power (SWAP) LANShark© hardware in Puma I UAS.  Demonstrated initial capabilities including the ability to turn the payload off to conserve battery power.</r2:Text>

The Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Joint Task Force level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and multi-national partners.  It connects the SOF warfighter with the essential intelligence information and provides situation awareness information to the SOF leadership at all echelons.  The four components of DCGS-SOF include the following:  The Enterprise provides infrastructure and processing capability to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing. Full Motion Video PED provides (FMV) PED capabilities in garrison and deployed environments of manned and unmanned sensors.  SILENT DAGGER provides Signals Intelligence exploitation capability in both garrison and deployed environments. The All Source Information Fusion (ASIF) will provide the intelligence analytical tools via a global and disconnected architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-SOF leverages SOF programs, DoD partners, National labs, and other Government Agencies to integrate commercial/government off-the-shelf systems, and other mature technologies into the Program of Record which resides within the SOF Information Enterprise and enables more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of data and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements.  The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, interagency, and Coalition tactical ISR PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by an engineering development team.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

USSOCOM is designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This program element addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY2017, this Program Element has been consolidated into SOCOM Program Element 1160434BB, Unmanned ISR.

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program.  Two programs are in this program element: Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).  SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations.   

USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program. Two programs are in this project: Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).  SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations. The current material solution for SUAS is the All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) of the Puma UAS. The current material solution for MTUAS is the Scan Eagle UAS.

USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 is the first year USSOCOM is participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser (HEL); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.  

CV-22 Development:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar program provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.

Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.

Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding:

FY 2016:  Decrease of -$6.169 million is due to a transfer of funds to Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs.

FY 2017:  Increase of $4.400 million in Project D615, Rotary Wing Aviation is due to an FY 2017 Request for Additional Appropriations to continue research, development, test and evaluation of new and modified detection and defeat countermeasures systems to improve aircraft survivability capabilities and address emerging threats to SOF rotary wing aircraft.

FY 2018:  Increase of $103.967 million is to complete flight testing efforts for A/MH-6M aircraft Block 3.0 upgrades ($11.839 million); research, develop and evaluate new and modified detection and defeat countermeasure systems and improve SOF rotary wing aircraft survivability ($13.700 million); development, integration and test to provide EW capability against RF threats on AC/MC-130J aircraft ($15.009 million); prepare for testing of the AbMN capability of near-real-time intelligence reporting to the SOF MC-130J fleet ($0.692 million); provides for risk reduction testing of the PSP HEL weapon onto AC-130J aircraft ($15.650 million); systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP integration and test on SOF platforms ($3.000 million); supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development, qualification, and operational flight testing of a SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar on the MC-130J  ($44.077 million).

Schedule:  SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar Initial Operational Test and Evaluation has been delayed until 2nd Quarter FY 2017, after an interoperability assessment revealed shortcomings in flight suitability and effectiveness.   Another software version must be developed to address these shortcomings.  EC-130J SOF-Unique 7.0/8.1 development slip was due to a delay in the 7.0/8.1 Air Force modification contract.  C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar trial kit installs were delayed due to subcontractor negotiations and resulted in a slip to contract award.  No change in development start.

Technical:  None.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the investigation, evaluation, development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements.  Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD), terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures (DCM) which includes Electronic Warfare – Radio Frequency Countermeasures (EW-RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection and identification technologies; digital broadcast capability; aerial refueling; Survivability; and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF UAS ISR platforms.

• EC-130J Upgrades provides for integration of SOF-unique implementation of the C-130J block cycle upgrade as installed on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft and development of digital broadcast capabilities.

 • EC-130J Commando Solo supports development, integration and testing of digital broadcast capabilities on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft.

• EW-RFCM supports development, integration and test activities to provide EW capability against RF threats for SOF AC/MC-130J aircraft.  The DCM suite is an integrated package of existing and future aircraft defensive systems which provides situational awareness and threat response processing; this includes the RFCM system, and future defensive systems.  RFCM program provides SOF-unique aircraft defensive capabilities required for SOF missions.

• PSP for SOF supports systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP and integration, installation, and test on host MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force for the AC-130H, AC-130W and AC-130U recapitalization, as well as current SOF C-130s,  AC-130Js and AC-130Ws, and other SOF platforms.  Missions for the AC-130 aircraft include, but are not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Air Interdiction, and Armed Reconnaissance.  PSP is modular, scalable, and platform neutral.
 
• PSP High Energy Laser (HEL) supports demonstration of HEL weapon onto AC-130 platforms.  HEL efforts include system design and evaluation of mature laser, beam director, power, and thermal subsystems.  The HEL components will be designed for modular upgrades and integrated with the PSP system.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports integration and test of a TF/TA radar and on-board processor to provide a multi-mode terrain following capability on MC-130J aircraft.  Crew systems integration efforts include modifications to aircraft controls and displays to automate TF/TA flight management and reduce pilot, copilot and Combat Systems Officer workload during missions previously performed by five aircrew members on legacy C-130 tankers and penetrators. This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), qualification, and operational flight testing of a SOF common TF/TA LPI/LPD radar to defeat advanced passive detection threats while maintaining ability to fly safe TF.  This radar is targeted for use on MH-47G heavy assault helicopters, MH-60M medium assault helicopters, MC-130J Commando II and CV-22 Osprey aircraft.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology supports development, integration, and testing of sensor miniaturization efforts to adapt large (Group 4-5) unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR capabilities on all SOF UAS ISR platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>• EC-130J Upgrades:  Operational Flight Program Block Cycle is being developed by the Air Force program office using existing development and production contracts.

• EC-130J Commando SOLO:  Digital broadcast capabilities are being developed through an incremental acquisition strategy to incorporate and test readily available equipment into the EC-130J aircraft.

• EW – RFCM:  Awarded competitive EMD contract for development. Down selected to the best overall solution to integrate and test an RF Countermeasures System on AC/MC-130J aircraft.

• PSP for SOF:  Incremental acquisition strategy to integrate and test the PSP and capability enhancements on donor MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force and other SOF aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• PSP HEL:  AC-130 HEL program utilizes Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division as the government integrator of HEL components.  HEL system components purchased under Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium broad area announcement using incremental Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts and cost sharing agreements.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Awarded delivery order on Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract to integrate and test the SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar on MC-130J aircraft and develop modifications to aircraft displays and controls. Government developmental test and evaluation, FY 2018 - FY 2020; Operational Test and Evaluation, FY 2021 with Initial Operational Capability, Q4FY2021.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Competitive EMD contract was awarded to Raytheon in FY 2007 for radar B Kit design, development, and testing.  Subsequent MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit design, integration, and test efforts awarded to Lockheed Martin (SOFSA). Low Rate Initial Production Contract II was awarded to Raytheon in May 2016.  Follow-on platform A Kit aircraft install kits will be awarded in FY 2018 - FY 2019.  MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit production and installation will be completed at the SOFSA. A follow-on Full Rate Production Firm-Fixed-Price contract following completion of operational testing.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in order to make them usable by smaller SOF ISR platforms, such as Group 2-3 UAS.  This development will include the integration of the ISR capability with the platform’s C2 and Communications systems as appropriate.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The funding in this program supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform. CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar program provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.

• Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.

The acquisition strategy for the CV-22 SKR program is to procure APQ-187 radar units and software modifications through the USSOCOM SKR Program Management Office. Contracts will be awarded to integrate SKR into the V-22 platform and buy aircraft modification kits, using a mixture of both sole source and competitive contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.

Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AC/MC-130J project funds core Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique modifications to replace aging/retired MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, and AC-130U Spooky aircraft. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J Gunship configuration. The AC-130J aircraft perform close air support (CAS), air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions.  The MC-130J aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improved lethality and enhanced aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  

•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components to the extent possible and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.

•  MH-60M Modification and Upgrades develops technologies to improve safety of the MH-60 and decrease operational costs. Efforts include, but are not limited to, DOD MH-60 engineering changes, product improvements to SOF unique equipment and munitions during testing. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades provides the development, integration, and qualification efforts on the MH-60 helicopter to include flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. 

•  Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aircrew.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in Degraded Visual Environments. This program addresses SOF-unique requirements for rapid fielding and weight limitations, capitalizes on the unique skills of the SOF aviator while integrating with SOF-unique avionics, and leverages existing sensors on SOF aircraft to the maximum extent possible.

 •  Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-unique modifications to the common aircraft.

•  Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird with potential use on the MH-60 and MH-47 aircraft. The IRCM program will integrate and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and countermeasure capability and infrared suppressor. The A/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the SOF inventory without protection from infrared guided and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense missiles.

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS) and Engine Barrier Filter. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats and enhance aircraft self-protection.

•  Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System.  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit: (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft’s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.

•  Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program improves targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness on ARSOA platforms. This program mitigates obsolescence and increases functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.

•  The Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Upgrades program develops, integrates, and tests critical active and passive SOF-unique aircraft survivability equipment to counter the acknowledged high proliferation of advanced Surface-to-Air (SA) threat systems for the A/MH-6, MH-60, and MH-47.  Additionally, these threat systems are technically evolving at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid counter system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, flares, and associated qualification testing.

•  Secure Real Time Video (SRTV) ensures that while en route to an objective, SOF aircrews and operators have access to the latest data collected on the objective enabling them to maintain situational awareness and improve survivability.  This project will integrate and test software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time full motion video intelligence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three major efforts:  airframe/rotors, engine control, and cockpit.  The airframe/rotors development effort will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Triumph Electronic Control Systems under sole-source contract to Rolls Royce.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item (NDI)/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-unique upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. 

•  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process was conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and heads up display of visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

•  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   

•  IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Naval Research Lab IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The Government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.   

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

•  MPU - Data Concentrator Unit (DCU) Modernization NRE will be used to improve analog-to-digital signal processing and reliability, as well as reduce weight.  The DCU efforts will be sole-source to Sanmina SCI Corporation, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the DCU.  The Future Aircraft Architecture Studies will be competitively awarded.

•  NGFLIR utilizes the Common Sensor Payload, an existing Army program of record, as a life-cycle replacement for the Q2V2 EOSS.  This effort mainly consists of upgrading the camera from Standard Definition to High Definition utilizing existing Army contracts with the OEM.  SOF-unique integration on the MH-60M DAP platforms will be accomplished through existing aircraft modification contracts.

•  The ASE Upgrades program develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment and flares.   For new systems, other services’ development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the original equipment manufacturer.

•  The SRTV project integrates and tests software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time full motion video intelligence.  A variety of contracting methods will be used for acquiring test assets, accomplishing SOF-unique modifications and testing to include use of other services’ contracts, competition, sole source awards, and directed efforts of government organizations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces. Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This sub-project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Special Operations Tactical Video System/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (TVS/RSTA);  Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).

U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    

OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    

•   NSSS.  This program provides research and development and rapid prototyping as the HQ SOCOM Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by leveraging National Geospatial-Intelligence (NGA) and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units to include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid development, fielding and deployment, and focus on transitioning to SOCOM Programs of Records (POR). These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM’s existing Military Intelligence Programs.  Focus items include:  Small Unmanned Aircraft System Multi-Intelligence geo-location and targeting capabilities with a Rapid Reliable Targeting system that supports NGA CAT1 level targeting, enhanced GEOINT processing capabilities by fusing Light Detection and Ranging with National Technical Means (NTM) and the Enhanced Image Rendering Tool, which allows sharing of NTM Imagery with coalition forces.  NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM’s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automate radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.

•   JTWS.  The JTWS System of Systems (SoS) enables the SOF Cryptologic Operator to collect, process, locate and exploit threat communications signals of interest in order to provide timely, relevant, and responsive intelligence, cross-cueing, and threat avoidance information directly to the SOF Commanders.  The JTWS SoS is assembled in four variants: Ground SIGINT Kit; Maritime; Air; and Unmanned Aerial Systems.  Each variant has additional requirements for Communications Intelligence, Electronic Intelligence, and Precision Geo-location.

•   HF-TTL.  This program utilizes a commodity procurement strategy to provide SOF warfighters with the necessary tools to find, fix, and finish terrorist networks through the emplacement of sophisticated tags and devices that feed into an integrated architecture.  HF-TTL provides Global Combatant Commanders (GCC) and SOF operators with an immediate capability to tag, track, and locate people, things, and activities.  The HF-TTL program provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners.  The mission sets comprise a mix of different classes of tags and their associated detection, interrogation, viewing, tracking, and communications systems that are fielded annually to SOF Components and TSOC based upon dynamic and emergent SOF operational requirements.  

•  TVS/RSTA.  This program provides SOF with critical Special Reconnaissance (SR) equipment that directly supports the planning and execution of SOF missions.  This capability allows the SOF warfighter to meet SOF SR mission requirements to find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate information of an adversary’s movement, construct, identification, location; and associated things and activities.  TVS/RSTA provides GCC and SOF operators with an immediate capability to visually and electronically acquire people, things, and activities and provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners and Commanders.  The program Family of Systems (FoS) consists of interoperable equipment to capture and transfer near-real-time ground-based, tactical day/night/reduced visibility, imagery, video, and electronic proximity and movement sensing, all capable of dissemination through SOF organic, global C4I, and commercial communications infrastructures.

ABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON) 

• SOFPREP.  This program serves as the intelligence focal point for production of SOF enhanced GEOINT (maps, imagery, and terrain data) and 3D scene visualization databases. SOFPREP gathers, processes, exploits, disseminates, and manages classified high resolution 3D databases and GEOINT data in support of SOF training, mission rehearsal, and execution preparation systems. The program builds the SOF common geospatial environment and manages the authoritative database of SOF-specific GEOINT terrain data.  SOFPREP is a NGA-certified co-producer in support of time-sensitive SOF specific requirements. 

•   ISP.  This program collects and produces current, detailed, tactical planning data to support military operations to counter threats against U.S. citizens, interests, and property located both domestically and overseas. ISP products are specifically tailored packages that provide operational information, as well as intelligence data for use by DOD and the U.S. Department of State to support operational planners for counter-terrorism operations, evacuations, and other rescue missions.

•   SSE.  This program provides the capability to exploit personnel, documents, electronic data, material, and forensic evidence on sensitive sites/objectives.  Biometric kits allow collection and transmission of unique, measurable biometric signatures from personnel, including live/latent fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features.  It also provides a means to verify against and enroll subjects into the DOD authoritative database, and to query that database to support hold or release decisions. Forensic kits enable on-objective linking of events to specific persons through chemical analysis, latent fingerprints, cell phones and computer data analysis, and deoxyribonucleic acid collection. Exploitation Analysis Centers provide theater-level mobile forensic capabilities for more in-depth exploitation of captured evidence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  NSSS introduces and integrates national systems capabilities into the SOF force structure and operations.  This is accomplished by partnering with existing IC POR to incorporate SOF mission requirements into current and developing technologies and assets.  This leveraging of funds increases national and commercial systems awareness, demonstrates the tactical utility of national systems and commercial data, tests technologies and evaluates operational concepts in biennial Joint Staff Special Projects, and allows for the transition of promising concepts and technologies to other SOF program offices for execution.

•  JTWS is a SoS leveraging commercial technologies and partnerships with other government agencies.  The POR will identify Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)/Government Off The Shelf capabilities requiring minimal modifications and only use new development when necessary. JTWS will address the continuously evolving threat environments on the Ground, Air, Maritime, and Unmanned Aircraft System variants, leverage existing partnerships with the National Security Agency and other government partners to integrate and sustain systems based on prioritized need from the Components and as emerging threats require technology modernizations.  Additionally, the POR will work to find common solutions across the variants and increase interoperability in order to reduce duplication of efforts.  The contracting strategy is a mixture of full and open competition for prime integrators and leveraging existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for COTS procurement.

•   HF-TTL utilizes a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide highly sophisticated TTL and close target audio/video devices capable of operating in various environments as needed to meet SOF operational requirements. Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, device level modifications, integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.  

•  TVS/RSTA employs an evolutionary strategy to incorporate the latest state of technology within its product line to provide upgraded next-generation technology insertion of COTS systems and address the changing threat environment to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations. 

•   SOFPREP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.

•   ISP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.

•   SSE uses a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide next-generation technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities supporting SOF exploitation mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system development and testing to meet continually emerging Counter RC-IED threats. 

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. 

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Munitions Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development and acquisition of Military Information Support Operations (MISO) equipment. MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders and includes: 

• Media Production and Broadcast Systems support the Media Production Center (MPC) and the Fly Away Broadcast System (FABS) MISO missions.  The MPC includes the fixed site MPC with light and medium media production capability.  FABS is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), cellular, and television (TV) transmitters.  

• Long Range Broadcast System (LRBS) is a family of broadcast systems intended to be integrated into multiple manned and unmanned, long-loiter aerial systems with the capability of broadcasting in AM, FM, SW, TV, Very High Frequency (VHF), TV Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and cellular (Short Message Service, Multi-Media Messaging Service, and Voice).  This system provides the capability of broadcasting MISO messages via multiple mediums into permissive, semi-permissive, and denied foreign areas.

• FABS is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of AM, FM, SW, cellular, and TV transmitters.

• Family Of Loudspeakers (FOL) is a portable loudspeaker system that is capable of disseminating high quality recorded and live audio messages by MISO Forces in varied geographical areas and climate conditions.  The new variant of the FOL is the Next Generation Loudspeaker System (NGLS).  The NGLS consists of a Dismounted and Mounted variants that are lighter, smaller, and louder than legacy speaker systems, with added clarity and durability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides specialized equipment to meet the unique operator protection and survival requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF) to include: Army Rangers; Army Special Forces; Navy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) teams; Navy Special Boat Units; Air Force Operators; and Marine Raiders.  Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems, as well load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF, while conducting varied missions, and personnel safety equipment.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. 

SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system mounts.  

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication, mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. 

Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future RC-IED threats used by terrorist networks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support Special Operations Forces (SOF). Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. 

•  SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity, voice, data, video tele-conferencing (VTC), and full motion video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms, transport for intelligence variants, technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.

•  Civil Information Management (CIM).  The CIM Data Processing System (CIMDPS) is an automation system that assists active Civil Affairs (CA) and others engaged in civil-military operations to collect, process, analyze, maintain, mine, and deliver Civil Information and analysis products in support of military operations.  

•  The Special Communications (SPCOM) Enterprise program, formerly justified as the Special Communication Enterprise (SCE) includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field) for worldwide deployed SOF units, often in austere environments with heavy adversarial monitoring.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF). Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.

- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. The TACLAN consists of Suites, Mission Planning Kits and Field Computing Devices, Coalition Local Area Network, and Full Motion Video Kits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios, which includes SOF Tactical Communications (STC), and Blue Force Tracking (BFT), rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY 2017 Unmanned ISR represents the approved consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies Program Element (PE) 0304210BB; MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), PE 0305219BB; MQ-8, PE 0305231BB; RQ-11, UAV PE 1105232BB; and RQ-7 UAV, PE 1105233BB.

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.

Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications to ground control stations. SAFC develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities that address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. This program provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  

Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC). Provides for efforts to develop and integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. SAFC applies focused Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&amp;D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets.

Group 1 UAS.  Group 1 UAS are small tactical systems, less than 20 pounds in weight.  Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.

Group 2 UAS.  Group 2 UAS are medium tactical systems, between 21 pounds and 55 pounds in weight. Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.

Group 3 UAS.  Group 3 UAS are large tactical systems that weigh less than 1,320 pounds and fly less than flight level 180.    

Group 4 UAS.  Group 4 UAS are large systems that weigh greater than 1,320 pounds and fly higher than flight level 180. Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Utilizes existing competed contract vehicles for minor development and integration and modification of Government-Off-The-Shelf/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf equipment. It utilizes limited/full and open competition contracts for major developments. 

The Group 1 UAS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

The Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  The current family of SOF tactical vehicles include: individual mobility vehicles, light mobility vehicles, medium mobility vehicles, non-standard commercial vehicles, and heavy mobility vehicles.     

Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FSOV).  This initiative provides for product improvements in the areas of suspension, power management, armor protection and unique vehicle design for all SOF tactical vehicle configurations.  Designs must be standardized across all SOF Components that utilize a tactical vehicle.   Improvements include, but are not limited to, new engineering change proposals (ECPs), field safety issues and theater endorsed requirements that make it essential to keep up with the increased weight and minimize the impact to mobility on the basic vehicle.  FSOV develops, integrates and tests Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems in order to reduce space and power claim on vehicles and develop safety and engineering improvements that specifically address the enemy’s changing tactics on the battlefield which typically focuses on survivability, force protection, or mobility.  Specific efforts include but are not limited to: Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) Medium Version 1.1 effort which provides for a medium vehicle variant capable of meeting specific requirements of internal aircraft transport on the C/MH-47.  The effort also provides for engineering costs related to performance, endurance, safety testing, integration and logistical analysis of product samples.  Additionally, efforts include ECPs associated with the Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle (NSCV), the Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV).  These ECPs will address any identified safety, reliability, and performance concerns.  Finally, funding will be used to support vehicle signature reduction efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These submersibles, equipment, and diving systems are used by SOF in the conduct of infiltration/extraction, personnel/material recovery, hydrographic/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:

•   Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS):  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development of one Engineering Developmental Model (EDM) to replace the SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) system.  The EDM is being developed due to obsolescence of the SDV system.  This project will utilize mature technologies, which include electric propulsion along with upgraded navigation, communication, and sensor suites.  It also provides for integration efforts with the current Dry Deck Shelter (DDS), development of engineering changes for SWCS production craft configuration, and integration of other diving technologies to meet SOF requirements.  

•  Dry Combat Submersible (DCS): This sub-project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development efforts for a surface-launched, dry, diver lock-in/lock-out vessel capable of inserting and extracting SOF and/or payloads into denied areas.  USSOCOM awarded an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in FY 2016 to produce one production representative vessel, with options to produce two additional vessels.   USSOCOM is testing one submersible prototype to validate test, commercial classification, and SOCOM safety certification processes and will continue to use the prototype to evaluate capability enhancing technologies and reduce risk in the DCS program.

•   DDS Modernization:  This sub-project provides for the pre-planned product improvements, testing, and integration of specialized underwater systems to meet the unique requirements of SOF, and compatibility with the submarine fleet.  The current DDS is a certified diving system which attaches to modified host submarines that provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms.  Funding supports product improvements to the current DDS, as well as associated diver equipment for in-service submarine support systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, and follow on development efforts for future SOF payloads.

•   SOF Combat Diving:  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, development, and transition of SOF peculiar diving equipment providing the SOF combat diver the ability to engage the enemy and conduct operations.  SOF Combat Diving will provide capabilities to USSOCOM components and will support the SDV, SWCS, and DCS in conduct of infiltration/extraction, material recovery, underwater ship attack, beach clearance, and other missions.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, commercial and developmental life support, maneuverability, employment of weapons, diver navigational accuracy and situational awareness, thermal protection, and underwater communications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development of medium and heavy surface combatant craft, combatant craft mission equipment, and pre-planned product improvement (P3I) and technology insertion engineering changes to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF).  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:

•   Combatant Craft Medium Mk 1 (CCM):  This sub-project is a semi-enclosed, low-observable, multi-mission combatant craft for platoon-size maritime mobility in maritime denied environments.  It is multi-mission capable, including Maritime Interdiction, Insert / Extract, and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) Operations.  CCM is Naval Special Warfare’s (NSW) craft-of-choice for long-range, high-payload SOF mobility operations in denied environments up to high threat.  CCM has NSW’s best Iron Triangle: 40 knot (kt) speed; 4 crew + 19 passengers (pax) / 10,000 pound (lb) payload; and 600 nautical miles (nm) range.  CCM Mk 1 payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 60 feet long, CCM is C-17 / C5 transportable and can launch/recover by well deck or shore based trailer.  

•   Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH):  This sub-project represents a family of solutions that provides platoon-size maritime surface mobility.  The current CCH is the Sea, Air, Land Insertion, Observation, and Neutralization (SEALION) craft.  SEALION is a fully-enclosed, climate-controlled, low-observable, semi-submersible craft that operates in denied environments up to high-threat. SEALION is NSW’s most versatile and survivable combatant craft and the craft-of-choice for sensitive maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and those missions requiring a prolonged presence in denied environments.  Its clandestine mobility capability is only exceeded by an undersea craft.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 7 crew + 12 pax / 3,300 lb payload; and 400 nm range.  SEALION payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 77+ feet long, SEALION is C-17/C-5 transportable and can launch/recover by well deck or shore based mobile travel lift or crane.  

•   Next Generation Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (NG CCFLIR):  The CCFLIR capability provides SOF with a multi-sensor, electro-optic system that enhances SOF effectiveness by improving their ability to detect, recognize, identify, range, track, and highlight objects of interest in a maritime environment.  The NG CCFLIR will use technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as operational range, image fusion, net-centric data sharing, information assurance, and seamless craft and combat systems integration.

•   Combatant Craft Mission Equipment (CCME):  This sub-project (previously Next Generation Surface Systems) provides a rapid response capability to support SOF combatant craft systems, subsystems, and their emerging requirements.  CCME provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as, but not limited to, conformal antennas, identification friend-or-foe capabilities, enhanced communications, weapon integration, software refresh, and navigation subsystems in support of future missions.  Solutions to these emerging requirements may be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), leveraged from other Government agencies , or new solutions. 

•   Combatant Craft Assault (CCA):  This sub-project is a National-to-Theater transition.  The CCA is the theater version of the High Speed Assault Craft.  The CCA is a low-observable combatant craft for squad-size maritime mobility operations in maritime denied environments.  CCA is NSW’s best craft for VBSS in maritime denied environments up to and including medium threat.  It is the craft-of-choice for maritime interdiction and boarding operations because of the open deck space, maneuverability, and interoperability with an Afloat Forward Staging Base.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 3 crew + 12 pax / 5,000 lb payload; and 300 nm range.  At 41 feet long, CCA is air transportable by C-130 / C-17 / C-5 and can launch/recover by crane, davit, well deck, or shore based trailer.

•  Threat Awareness System (TAS):  This sub-project provides SOF with an Electronic Intelligence capability for enhanced force protection of SOF in Maritime denied environments by allowing them to identify and avoid enemy detection capabilities.  TAS will utilize technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as miniaturization and marinization to enable seamless craft integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  CCM acquisition strategy was a competition using a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistic support.  

•  CCH:  SEALION I &amp; II were transitioned from U.S. Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I &amp; II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity.  Based on market research completed in December 2015; currently pursuing a Sole Source award for SEALION III in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I &amp; II.

•  NG CCFLIR:  Completed a full and open competition in September 2015.  An Engineering Manufacturing Development contract was awarded to FLIR Systems Incorporated, which included production and sustainment options.  The NG CCFLIR will be installed on the CCM, CCH, and CCA.

•  CCME acquisition strategy emphasizes on spearheading Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology for successful transition into SOF Combatant Crafts. CCME accomplishes this by using the full spectrum of contracting services, using existing contracts where appropriate, and leveraging from other Government agencies including the Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L Science &amp; Technology. CCME focuses on developing the technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility, to then transition to the craft. The integration and procurement piece is managed by the individual Combatant Craft Program.

•  CCA will use various contracting and better buying power practices to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the craft’s current performance envelope.

•  TAS will conduct market research to determine feasibility and appropriateness of conducting a full and open competition. TAS will pursue existing Government-Off-The-Shelf technology in order to reduce acquisition timeline.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) transfer from OSD (PE 0602230D8Z) to WHS - (Non-Management Headquarters)

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) relies on innovation to maintain our nation’s ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict.  Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) increases the Department’s access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter.  Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIUx is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include “non-traditional” companies that never imagined the military as a potential customer, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their tremendous talents on the vital and difficult mission of our nation’s defense.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016.  

DIUx mission is to accelerate innovation the majority of which resides in the commercially- focused technology sector to the warfighter.  Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, (USD, AT&amp;L) when it was established in July 2015.  In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the operational control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) with a functional realignment of $148.8 million across the FYDP to WHS.

DIUx funds the acquisition and/or prototyping of leading-edge technologies from commercially-focused companies (i.e., “non-traditionals”) from Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and across the country; as well as from traditional defense contractors that either partner with non-traditionals or offer one-third in cost sharing.  DIUx acquires and/or prototypes these commercially viable technologies solutions, in direct response to particular capability gaps faced by our nation’s warfighters.  As such, solution proposals are assessed to ensure alignment with DoD’s strategic objectives to increase and strengthen our nation’s security.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Initially, this program was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, (USD, AT&amp;L) with functional realignment of $148.8 million across the FYDP to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) beginning in FY 2018.  The DIUx program will fund the development of novel leading-edge technologies emerging from high-tech companies that are not traditional defense contractors.  An objective of this program is to obtain innovative ideas from industry that have low technology readiness and are of high priority to DoD leadership.  Incoming proposals will be assessed to ensure alignment with the DoD’s strategic objectives to increase and strengthen our nation’s security.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

With outposts in the heart of Silicon Valley and Boston, Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) serves as a bridge between those in the U.S. military executing on some of our nation's toughest security challenges and companies operating at the cutting edge of technology.  DIUx is an experiment that continuously repeat how best to identify, contract, and prototype novel innovations through sources traditionally not available to the Department of Defense, with the ultimate goal of accelerating technology into the hands of warfighters and keep them on the cutting edge of technology.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     Approve component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).
-     Approve component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversee Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Report results of OT&amp;E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     Review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
 (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. 

DOT&amp;E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&amp;E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Funding for FY 2016 provides Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2016 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.  

Cybersecurity Evaluations

DOT&amp;E sponsored seven Combatant Command (CCMD) and two Service cybersecurity exercise assessments in FY 2016.  In addition to the nine exercise assessments, DOT&amp;E performed two assessments during visits to operational sites not involved in an exercise.  All DOT&amp;E-sponsored assessments included a “fix” phase during which DOT&amp;E-funded cybersecurity experts helped CCMD and Service personnel address critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  As part of our new Cyber Readiness Campaigns (CRCs), DOT&amp;E worked with U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. European Command, and U.S. Southern Command to evaluate a larger spectrum of cybersecurity related issues than is possible during a short exercise.  The CRCs included more frequent and focused assessment events, and they helped commands address persistent, mission-critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  To enable more threat-representative and longer-duration adversary portrayal, DOT&amp;E initiated a Persistent Cyber Opposing Force (PCO) capability as part of U.S. Pacific Command’s CRC as well as at U.S. Northern Command.  DOT&amp;E worked with U.S. Cyber Command to expand the use of PCOs to better understand and address our network vulnerabilities, to be more threat representative, and to allow more efficient use of limited cyber red team assets.  To support cybersecurity assessments of live DoD networks, DOT&amp;E conducted lab-based cyber testing of cross-domain solutions (CDSs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  These are critical components in many DoD systems and networks, and DOT&amp;E’s testing resulted in recommendations to improve CDS and PLC security and test procedures.   Using personnel with advanced cybersecurity expertise, DOT&amp;E conducted evaluations of a small number of offensive cyber capabilities in direct support of the capabilities’ sponsor.  DOT&amp;E transmitted critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD’s cybersecurity posture. DOT&amp;E’s FY 2016 cybersecurity evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.</r2:Text>

This effort is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities and is a continuing effort.  Funding for FY 2017 provides Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2017 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List. 

Cybersecurity Evaluations 

DOT&amp;E plans to sponsor approximately 10 CCMD and Service cybersecurity assessments and CRCs in FY 2017, each including a “fix” phase as described above.  DOT&amp;E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multi-year plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events.  These plans will focus on assessing the CCMD or Service’s ability to complete missions in a contested cyber environment.  To support threat-representative assessments, and to enable continuous improvement of DoD’s cybersecurity posture, DOT&amp;E will continue to work with U.S. Cyber Command to establish a PCO capability for all CCMDs and Services.  Primary objectives for DOT&amp;E’s assessments in FY 2017 include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks.  DOT&amp;E will assess Cyber Protection Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC or exercise events.  DOT&amp;E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, and conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities. DOT&amp;E will use the DoD Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) and other lab and cyber range assets to support events, for added threat realism. DOT&amp;E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD’s cybersecurity posture.   FY 2017 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.</r2:Text>

Cybersecurity Evaluations

DOT&amp;E will oversee and resource approximately 10 CCMD and Service assessments in FY 2018, each including a “fix” phase.  Pending CCMD and Service agreement, DOT&amp;E plans to conduct CRC events with all of the CCMDs and Services.  Each CRC will include frequent assessments focused on new cybersecurity technologies or procedures to address problems identified in prior assessments. CRCs will culminate in a capstone event during a major exercise that evaluates the cybersecurity of critical missions, as improved by the new technologies and procedures.  Using the PCO, DOT&amp;E will continue to work with the CCMDs and cyber red teams to increase the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats.  The goal is to have the majority of assessments in FY 2018 include advanced threats that stress critical missions.  DOT&amp;E will assess Cyber Protection Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC or exercise events.  DOT&amp;E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, and conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities. DOT&amp;E will use the DoD Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) and other lab and cyber range assets to support events, for added threat realism.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME).  

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. 

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            In FY16, JLF funded 27 projects and delivered 21 reports.  Focus areas for JLF included projects that either 1) characterized new survivability issues; 2) characterized new lethality issues; 3) improved accuracy and fidelity of weapon data; 4) improved test methods; or 5) improved modeling and simulation methods.

JLF Air projects evaluated a range of contemporary vulnerability issues.  Projects investigated the ballistic vulnerability of (1) rotorcraft with auxiliary fuel tanks inside the cabin; and (2) C-12 fuel subsystem ullage reactions.  Another project evaluated the effectiveness of the CV-22 Wing Fire Protection System during various modes of fuel transfer.  In addition, the effectiveness of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene armor installed in CV-22 cabins (due to emerging threats encountered on the battlefield) was addressed by one project.  Other projects improved modeling and simulation tools by collecting aircraft system-level damage effects data for medium-class missile warheads against fixed-wing aircraft, as well as a project to determine the vulnerability to yawed armor-piercing and armor-piercing incendiary projectiles.  Finally, JLF Air projects assessed vulnerability to foreign threats such as the OG-7V fragmentation grenade as well as MANPADS.

JLF Ground projects pursued a variety of lethality and survivability research objectives.  One project characterized the complete fragmentation description data for an MK84 bomb.  Other efforts quantified collateral damage effects from Hellfire and MK82 warheads, developed better methods to characterize blast debris for collateral damage assessments, and measured the effect of bomb burial on collateral damage.  Other projects modeled the behind-armor debris of ground vehicle kinetic energy penetrators as well as anti-tank mines, and an underbody blast vulnerability assessment of the JLTV was conducted.  JLF Ground projects sought to develop materials to better evaluate body armor as well as evaluate various materials used in combat eye protection.  JLF Ground conducted modeling to determine a more lethal mix of 30 mm ammunition combinations.  Finally, JLF Ground pursued efforts to enhance test &amp; evaluation methodology such as improved methods of collecting arena test data.

JLF Sea projects provided various vulnerability results.  One JLF Sea project conducted deep depth underwater explosion testing against a model surrogate to improve submarine vulnerability assessments.  Another project collected test data of underwater explosion bubble jetting in order to improve modeling and simulation tools.  Finally, another project developed ballistic mannequins that provide for real-time assessment of rapid incapacitation.
	
	JLF continued to support the development of a ground vehicle survivability educational program, including a 3-day short course and the development of formal course notes and a textbook.

Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP)

In FY 2016 the JASP continued work on 37 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiated 18 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP addressed improving the effectiveness and reducing the space, weight and power required for directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, integrated aircraft survivability equipment, and aircrew situational awareness. In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP continued to address requirements for lighter and more effective vulnerability reduction technology (e.g., armor, fuel containment, fire suppression, and aircrew and passenger protection). In aircraft survivability Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), the JASP continued to improve survivability M&amp;S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&amp;S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  The JASP completed 27 reports documenting efforts accomplished in FY 2016.
The JCAT continued to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP continued supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness

JTCG/ME continued to field critical JMEM products to enable on-going Combatant Command (CCMD) operational Weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, along with support to the Anti-air effectiveness community (operational, training, testing, and analysis).  

In FY16, JTCG/ME continued to develop and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness, including target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and Combatant Commands’ needs.
 
JTCG/ME deployed and continued enhancement of future versions of its two major JTCG/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) products, the JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) and Joint Antiair Combat Effectiveness (J-ACE). The JTCG/ME also continued coordination and development of a non-kinetic JMEM capability, to include a prototype Cyber JMEM. Beyond traditional JMEM products, JTCG/ME developed and supplied specialized weaponeering data and solutions for Warfighter requirements. This includes the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool and Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE), as well as standalone resources such as the Probability of kill (Pk) Lookup Tools, Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) tables, and munitions weaponeering guides.

JWS is the DoD wide source for air-to-surface (AS) and surface-to-surface (SS) weaponeering, munitions, and target information used daily in the U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) in the deliberate planning process directly supporting Joint Publication 3-60 “Joint Targeting”. JWS enables Combatant Commands to efficiently prosecute their target sets. JWS incorporates accredited methodologies, certified munition characteristics, delivery accuracy, target vulnerability data, and numerous user aids to support the operational use of JWS to predict weapons effectiveness for fielded weapons and delivery systems.    

The JTCG/ME deployed JWS v2.2 in FY16. JWS v2.2 included a total of 220 methodology, functionality, weapons/warheads/fuzes, and target updates. JWS v2.2 included initial connectivity with the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) Tool, as well as updates to the Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST) (containing building types and a quasi-static blast capability) and other high priority User requirement updates. The connectivity with DCiDE improves both speed and throughput of data. This capability enabled the Combatant Commands to have operational targeting, weaponeering, and collateral damage estimation capability in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training. Additionally, Warfighters were able to put ordnance on target and as such, directly affected combat effectiveness in current operations.

JTCG/ME continued to facilitate coalition interoperability in FY16, and is currently completing several JWS version releases to key coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreements. These efforts will enable the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Republic of Korea, and other coalition partners to plan operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses. This capability is critical to the effectiveness of U.S. targeting and fires personnel working in combined environments.  

JTCG/ME finalized integration, performed operational testing, and progressed to final systems verification for JWS v2.3 in FY16, with Risk Mitigation Framework testing and release scheduled for FY17. JWS v2.3 will include enhanced data sets and capabilities with focus on connectivity to other targeting and mission planning capabilities for improved estimates and more seamless planning. Specifically, JWS v2.3 will include new/updated data sets, new Imagery Interface to implement aimpoint development leveraging the Tasked Target Text Data (T3D) data format implemented by currently fielded mission planning systems. JWS software and T3D imagery interface modifications to support integration of Electronic Light Table (ELT) viewers. There will also be a Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) and Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT) interface with additional capabilities to support connectivity. These developments will enable the integration of Weaponeering, Precision Point Mensuration (PPM) and Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) via Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE). JWS v2.3 will also add the updated Gunship Delivery Accuracy Program (GDAP), Rotary Wing Delivery Accuracy Program (RWDAP), and Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST) v2.0. 

JTCG/ME continued to deliver data and methodology for integration and development of JWS v2.4 in FY16. Enhanced capabilities for data and connectivity will continue for JWS v2.4 during FY17.

JTCG/ME began to plan and refine a future JWS architecture strategy to enable interactive scene base weaponeering, maximize re-use and interoperability of capabilities, increase speed of modeling and simulation, support future hardware/software compatibility, and support allied releasability. A key to this strategy is a JWS v3.x prototyping effort initiated in FY16, which will continue in FY17.

The JTCG/ME released Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool version v1.2.3 in FY16 to support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01B – “No-Strike and the Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Methodology”. The DCiDE tool is critical to the Warfighters’ ability to meet Urgent Operational Needs for an accredited automated CDE tool that both expedites and simplifies the CDE process. DCiDE is the only automated CDE tool authorized for use in the USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM Areas of Operation (AORs). The JTCG/ME CDE tables are used in every planned kinetic strike in all AORs to meet Commanders intent and to minimize civilian casualties. JTCG/ME updated the accredited Collateral Effect Radii (CER) Reference Tables for selected AS/SS weapons, which are the basic data that supports the CDE methodology. Changes included additions for airburst munitions, nomenclature changes, and additional updates for newly fielded/updated systems (e.g., Hellfire family). JTCG/ME also developed and accredited the Collateral Effects Library (CEL) Tool in support of advanced CDE mitigation techniques. DOT&amp;E received positive feedback on the use of the CER values as a critical enabler in support of munitions employment against high value targets (HVTs).

JTCG/ME is finalizing the Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE) v2.0  with DPSS. DIEE will provide both seamless planning and direct linkages between JWS and mission planning systems in operational units. DIEE will combine applications that will allow targeteers and operational planners to develop more rapid strike plans, due to seamless connectivity of weaponeering, collateral damage estimation, and precision point mensuration results to mission planning systems for target execution. This new concept will integrate capabilities of an Electronic Light Table (ELT), Precision Point Mensuration tool (Common Geopositioning Services - CGS), and CDE tool (DCiDE), as well as other targeting applications in what we are calling an Integrated Display Viewer (IDV). Although DIEE is in final development, with expected fielding by beginning of FY17, several Combatant Commands have already committed to using DIEE as their primary tool for full-integrated targeteering capability.

J-ACE provides authoritative air-to-air (AA) and surface-to-air (SA) weapons effectiveness information, and serves as the primary tool used by the Air Force and Navy to underpin air combat tactics, techniques, and procedures development. J-ACE is the umbrella program that includes both the Joint Anti-air Model (JAAM) and Endgame Manager (EM), which provides a full kill chain (end-to-end) capability. Other Users include National Test and Training Ranges for AA/SA shot validation and various members of the analytical community for air combat studies and planning. U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) leverages J-ACE capabilities to support of route planning for the execution of strike packages. JAAM supports operational squadrons mission de-brief tools such as Personal Computer Debriefing System (PCDS) and several others. 

In FY16, JTCG/ME performed operational testing and progressed to final systems verification reviews for J-ACE v5.3, with expected Risk Mitigation Framework testing and fielding in FY17. J-ACE v5.3 will extend and update data sets for missile and aircraft target aero-performance, anti-air missile lethality, and air target vulnerability. New capabilities include the Hybrid Integration and Visualization Engine (HIVE) computer architecture interface and BLUEMAX6 (six degree of freedom aero performance) model for increased aircraft aero performance modeling with Hands-On-Stick-and-Throttle (HOTAS) and display capability allowing for actual flight control of the air craft, as well as increased counter-measure capabilities leveraging Enhanced Surface-to-Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS). J-ACE v5.3 will also include the effect of weapon system reliability on the probability of a successful engagement. The fielding of J-ACE v5.3 will allow greater aero performance options and the ability to estimate counter-measure effectiveness. A key enhancement of J-ACE v5.3 is the continued evolution of the J-ACE architecture to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing. 

JTCG/ME continued to develop, deliver, and integrate data and methodology for J-ACE v5.4, which will provide enhanced data, methodology, and descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and EM. The fielding of J-ACE v5.4 in FY18 will allow for greater connectivity for outbrief capabilities by units, target detection estimation, counter Air Defense prediction capability, and enhanced architecture allowing future version growth and compatibility. J-ACE will enhance Personal Computer Debriefing System (PCDS) capability, and further evaluate enhancement of aircraft maneuverability modeling with HIVE/BLUEMAX6. In addition, JAAM will include capability to evaluate two sided Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (DEAD); improved target detection capability leveraging National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Infrared (IR) and Radio Frequency (RF) models; and multiple ESAMS capability. The J-ACE architecture continues to be enhanced to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing.

JTCG/ME performed requirements analysis and planning for J-ACE v5.5. J-ACE v5.5 will include rotary wing aircraft capability and further expansion of electronic warfare and counter-measure capabilities. User input through working groups and training sessions are feeding requirements generation and planning to ensure alignment with User community. 

In FY16, JTCG/ME continued the development of non-kinetic weaponeering tools and methodologies. Joint Non‑Kinetic Effectiveness is intended to be the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities, electronic attack weapons, and directed energy effectiveness.  

In conjunction with DOT&amp;E and the Air Force’s 363rd Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group, the JTCG/ME continued development of a JMEM process for cyberspace operations, electronic attack, and directed energy. FY16 efforts centered on developing the foundational elements for JMEM production, including weapons characteristics, target vulnerability, and effects estimation tools (e.g., U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber Capabilities Registry, Electronic Warfare/Cyber Critical Elements/Weaponeering Guides, and Directed Energy Effectiveness Lookup Tables). These efforts culminated in an initial Cyber JMEM prototype to stimulate user interaction, feedback, and maturation, while setting the foundation for a full J-NKE capability suite, to include other non-kinetic effects (e.g., directed energy). JTCG/ME will continue to refine these initial efforts in FY17, with further expanded efforts in FY18.

Since JTCG/ME products are User focused and requirements driven, there is considerable effort that goes into working with Users to establish Warfighter requirements for on-going efforts and future JTCG/ME products. 

The Operational Users Working Group (OUWG) is a critical venue for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support AS, SS, AA, and non-kinetic engagements. JTCG/ME continued to chair OUWGs, while representatives from USCENTCOM, USAFRICOM, USSTRATCOM, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), USSOCOM, the Services, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Fires Center of Excellence, Service School Houses, the Marine Aviation Weapons/Tactics Squadron, Operations Support Squadrons, Intelligence Squadrons, and numerous other operational units routinely participate. 

JTCG/ME provided User training on its products. For JWS in FY16, JTCG/ME supported 23 JWS sessions at 19 CONUS/OCONUS locations and approximately 340 students. For DCiDE, JTCG/ME supported numerous training classes to support units in USCENTCOM (e.g., Combined Task Forces, J-34 FIRES, and J2 Targeting Elements), USPACOM, and coalition partners (e.g., Australia). With new versions of JWS, DCiDE, DIEE, and J-ACE expected in FY17, there will be additional growth in training support.  

JTCG/ME provides help desk and training packages via the JMEM Product Information Access System (JPIAS), as well as product newsletters. FY16 support included addressing over 400 User support requests and developing training aids, such as the JWS Training Tidbits and Sample Weaponeering Problems.

At times User requirements call for specialized solutions, such as weapons fielded between product releases and need for urgent target vulnerability surrogations to support current operations. JWS is the calculation engine used to develop Quick Weaponeering Guides/Probability of Kill Lookup Tool software to address some of these requirements. FY16 examples include updates for the AGM-114, AGM-176, GBU-49/BLU-129, GBU-49/BLU-126, GBU-12/BLU-129. JTCG/ME also leveraged the Collateral Effects Library to deliver 40 collateral damage mitigation analysis packages to operational Users for HVTs. There were seven rapid request target vulnerability surrogation packages (31 target-weapon pairings - filled based on Urgent Operational Needs), and a specialized AN/SEQ-3(XN-1) Solid State Laser-Quick Reaction Capability Laser Weapon System (SSL-QRC LAWS) Weaponeering Guide authored.</r2:Text>

JLF Programs

	The FY 2018 budget will support the planning and execution of tests of fielded systems not previously tested under the Live Fire Programs to support DOT&amp;E and operator needs.  New threats, missions, TTPs, and combat environments will create the need for these tests and an assessment of performance.  JLF projects will be defined, planned, and executed to provide survivability and lethality data on currently fielded U.S. systems; improve modeling and simulation tools; develop vulnerability data libraries for emerging threats; and initiate responses to quick reaction requests from theater.

JASP

In FY 2018 the JASP will continue work on at least 27 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate about 5 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness.  Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft.
The JCAT will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness

In FY18, JTCG/ME will continue to develop and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness, including target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and CCMDs’ needs. 

JTCG/ME will deploy and continue to enhance future versions of its two major JTCG/ME JMEM products, the JWS and J-ACE. The JTCG/ME will increase development of a non-kinetic JMEM capability, as well as the DIEE and Collateral Damage Estimation capabilities. Beyond traditional JMEM products, JTCG/ME will continue to support specialized weaponeering data and solutions for Warfighter urgent requirements and support Users. This includes standalone resources such as the Pk Lookup Tools, CDE tables, and munitions weaponeering guides. The objective is to provide efficient and effective support to meet CCMD current and future needs for agility in a dynamic operational environment. 

JTCG/ME will continue to expand coalition interoperability in FY18 with JWS version releases to key coalition partners in support of current operations under FMS agreements. Past efforts enabled the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Republic of Korea, and other coalition partners to plan operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses. This capability is critical to the effectiveness and synergy of U.S. targeting and fires personnel working in combined partnered environments.  

JTCG/ME will field JWS v2.4 in FY18. JWS v2.4 will include enhanced and updated weapons and target data sets, improved Graphical User Interphases for improved business logic and human system interaction, and improved database designs for speed and updates. When fielded, this capability will continue to enable CCMDs to have operational targeting, weaponeering, and collateral damage estimation capability in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training. 

JTCG/ME will develop and begin implementing JWS v3.x product line capabilities. JWS v3.x will enable interactive scene base weaponeering, maximize re-use and interoperability of capabilities, increase speed of modeling and simulation, support future hardware/software compatibility, and support allied releasability. JWS v3.x efforts will implement the JEL, which will provide open architecture capabilities. JWS v3.x is the next evolution of agile, scalable capability solutions to meet the needs of the Joint Force in a dynamic operational environment.

Beginning in FY18 (based on FY18-22 increases), JTCG/ME will have focused efforts to enhance and validate collateral damage. The enhancement will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces while not increasing risk of collateral damage by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools. Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD  Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities to make their strike decision calls. 

JTCG/ME will continue to support updates for DCiDE tools in FY18 to support the CJCSI 3160.01B – “No-Strike and the CDE Methodology”. JTCG/ME will update and the accredit CER Reference Tables for selected AS/SS weapons, which are the basic data that supports the CDE methodology. 

JTCG/ME will field DIEE v2.2. DIEE enhancements will continue to provide agile capability solutions for the Joint Force Commander in dynamic operational environments. JTCG/ME will continue to sustain and monitor DIEE requirements with the User community.
 
JTCG/ME will field J-ACE v5.4 in FY18. J-ACE v5.4 will provide enhanced data, methodology, and descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and EM. 

JTCG/ME will finalize development and provide operational testing for J-ACE v5.5 in FY18. J-ACE v5.5 will include rotary wing aircraft capability and further expansion of electronic warfare and counter-measure capabilities. 

JTCG/ME will continue to develop, deliver, and integrate data and methodology for J-ACE v5.6 based on User requirements from working groups and training sessions to ensure alignment with User community. 

Joint Non‑Kinetic Effectiveness JMEMs are intended to be the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities and directed energy effectiveness. Beginning in FY18 (based on FY18-22 increases), JTCG/ME will enhance development of non-kinetic weaponeering tools and methodologies. JTCG/ME will continue to develop and mature the JMEM process for cyberspace operations and directed energy.

JTCG/ME will expand efforts to review, analyze and synthesize offensive cyber capabilities and target data into standardized Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals. Cyber JMEM is a top priority of USCYBERCOMMAND and CCMDs to support their Warfighting Force. FY18 efforts will include increased manpower to further enhance and build upon prototype efforts in FY16 and FY17. These increased efforts and resources will culminate in institutionalized methodology and cyber effectiveness capabilities that will provide warfighters with non-kinetic weaponeering assessments and a common non-kinetic measurement to predict cyber capability outcomes. The publishing of JMEMs, accreditation of non-kinetic capability effectiveness methodologies, facilitation for validation of operational data, and the population of non-kinetic capability databases will help fulfill the Department's Cyber Strategy.

 Since JTCG/ME products are User focused and requirements driven, there is considerable effort that goes into working with Users to establish Warfighter requirements for on-going efforts and future JTCG/ME products. 

JTCG/ME will chair OUWGs. OUWGs are a critical venue for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support AS, SS, AA, and non-kinetic engagements. JTCG/ME will continue User training on its products in FY18, as well as provide help desk and training packages via the JPIAS and newsletters. 

JTCG/ME will support urgent operational needs with specialized solutions, such as weapons fielded between product releases and need for urgent target vulnerability surrogations to support current operations.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&amp;A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&amp;A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).

Joint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&amp;E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.

Threat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&amp;E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&amp;E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  Threat Systems provides DOT&amp;E assessment officers and other DOT&amp;E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.

The Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) T&amp;E Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&amp;E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&amp;E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), weapon system developers, and the Services.  The Center’s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The Center develops unique CM/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines effectiveness of precision guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs.  Analysis and recommendations on CM/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&amp;E, DASD (DT&amp;E), and the Services.  The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM/CCM technology and capabilities.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY 2016 four JT&amp;E projects closed and four projects continued. One of the projects that closed was the Joint Base Architecture for Secure Industrial Control Systems Joint Test that tested joint industrial control systems network tactics, techniques, and procedures to better identify, mitigate, and recover from advanced, persistent cyber-attacks.  Another project that closed was the Joint Tactical Air Picture Joint Test that developed tactics, techniques, and procedures to provide an improved tactical air picture that decreases the risk of hostile attacks and fratricide as well as increases the effective use of integrated air and missile defense systems.

Three new feasibility studies were conducted in FY 2016, two of which were selected to conduct joint tests.

Threat Systems

Threat Systems continued test planning working group participation and performed technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conducted special studies and provided current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions; continued managing intelligence “deep dives” to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets; operated and maintained the modeling and simulation configuration control board for threat models and simulation used in test facilities; and continued the development and implementation of a tri-Service and Allied threat M&amp;S roadmap to ensure infrared countermeasure systems have sufficient threat test assets. Moreover, Threat Systems represented DOT&amp;E concerns at the Threat Steering Group (TSG) through the transition from the System Threat Assessment Reports (STARS) to the new Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) report process.  Represented DOT&amp;E interests on Acquisition/Intelligence/ Requirement Task Force (AIRTF) and Executive Steering Group (AIRESG) and provided access to the Intelligence Mission Data Management Analysis &amp; Reporting System (IMARS).  Threat Systems proposed, managed, and oversaw threat test assets funded by the Test Resource Management Center that support DOT&amp;E-identified threat shortfalls, identified candidate threat systems from the various intelligence agencies for possible development of models for use in test and evaluation. Initiated actions to embrace the growing and evolving DOT&amp;E Cyber Threat requirements and analyzing the convergence of Cyber and Electronic Warfare effecting the baseline required for OT.  Threat Systems also continued efforts to maintain a standard set of threat performance models.

These activities helped DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.

The Center

The Center completed 32 T&amp;E activities and analyzed and reported on more than 30 different systems, with special emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CM/CCM employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs. Several programs the Center supported received an independent assessment of our data/findings and test support for their CM/CCM evaluations. Our support was distributed across all the Services.

Approximately 40% of the Center’s efforts were spent on aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) testing, with the majority of these efforts in support of Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) and Urgent Universal Needs Statement (UUNS). About 22% of the Center’s efforts were spent on PGW, foreign systems, and other types of field testing not related to ASE. Approximately 8% of the Center’s efforts were dedicated to CM–based, pre-deployment training for rotary wing units. 

Twenty-six percent of the Center’s efforts were spent on internal programs to improve test capabilities and to develop test methodologies for new types of T&amp;E activities. These internal programs include the, Joint Standard Instrumentation Suite (JSIS) and Multi-Spectral Sea and Land Target Simulator (MSALTS) upgrades, a new test van to support the Remote Launcher system (RLS), and upgrades to existing equipment. The Center is expanding its presence/expertise in the electronic warfare (EW) realm with an internally funded threat radar stimulation capability. These systems will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and ASE urgent operational needs. 

About 4% of the Center’s efforts consisted of providing subject matter expertise and other support not directly related to scheduled test activities. The Center provided expertise to many organizations and was actively involved in the following panels: Joint Expendable Countermeasures (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&amp;E Subcommittee, Joint Countermeasures T&amp;E Working Group (JCMT&amp;E WG), and JCMT&amp;E WG Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) subgroup lead.</r2:Text>

In FY 2017 JT&amp;E plans on closing two projects that were started in FY 2015. One, the Joint Pre-/Post-Attack Operations Supporting Survivability &amp; Endurability Joint Test, expected to close in February 2017, will develop and test procedures for protective posturing and mobile support that will mitigate the effects of an electromagnetic-pulse on mission critical functions. The other project to close in FY 2017 is the Joint Advanced Sensor to Shooter Joint Test, which is looking to develop, test and evaluate tactics, techniques, and procedures to more efficiently and effectively gain and maintain battle space awareness through integration of rapidly developed capabilities to support combat operations in anti-access and active denial environments

Two projects that started in FY 2016 will continue through FY 2017.

Four new feasibility studies are expected to be conducted in FY 2017, two of which will be selected to conduct joint tests.

Threat Systems

In FY 2017, Threat Systems will continue test planning working group participation and perform technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions based on the availability of funding.

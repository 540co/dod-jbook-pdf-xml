            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Theater Enterprise Deployment and Distribution (TED2) analysis, the Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCC) identified several gaps between United States Transportation Command's strategic lift processes and GCCs' distribution processes.  Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo/passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Theater Capability, through the implementation of process improvements, integration of commercial transportation management/optimization tools, and the development of deployment/distribution supporting technologies, will provide the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters’ needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  

Beginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  
•	The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  
•	Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. 
•	The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.    

Over the FY 18- FY 22 Planning Period, funds were realigned within the ManTech PE, from the DLA Log R&amp;D PE (0603712S) and DLA Procurement Defense-Wide Fund.  These funds will address critical shortfalls in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes and Maintaining Viable Supply Sources.  The largest requirement was in the Maintaining Viable Supply Sources to develop a long-term, reliable source of linear microcircuits.  These devices are critical to maintaining the readiness of front line weapon system electronics.  High priority requirements in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA included additional funding for battery technology, castings and forging manufacturing technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) is an R&amp;D effort undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times, assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings/Forging Programs and Additive Manufacturing programs.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. BATTNET conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries.  BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

DLA is also conducting some short-term (FY17-FY18) manufacturing improvements in the Vacuum Electron Tube supply chain within this Budget Project. Electron tubes are still an essential product in Defense and National Security radar systems. included will be value-added studies and tests of alternative materials for tungsten wire and microwave quality glass to address obsolescence in these material supply chains.

The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) Program is a Manufacturing Technology Program and is the successor to the CORANET R&amp;D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program's expanded areas of interest includes: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. Desired outcomes include measures such as reduced cost, increased efficiencies, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.

The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The Subsistence Network plan in FY17 is to expand to the broader subsistence network; having awarded the Broad Agency Announcement in 2016. DLA will work short term projects (STPs) with the community of practice partners of the military services, industry and academia.  SUBNET plans to improve process capabilities by identifying targets for product, automation and business operation changes, and implementing solutions in the Subsistence Supply Chain to produce such improvements as shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead cost, and improved quality. The STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as return on investment where applicable to ensure that all SUBNET STPs are fully documented, all projects have the potential for implementation in industry; and all projects address a specific DoD/DLA need.  

The Castings program will receive a significant increase in funding starting in FY17 to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR 17 process. Projects identified will investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter.  Contracts will be competitively awarded in FY17.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success.

The Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.

The Battery Network funding will be applied to pursue additional projects including production readiness of lithium conformable soldier batteries, military ground vehicle batteries, and aviation batteries; manufacturing transition of legacy and obsolete lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries to advanced lithium-ion batteries; and battery manufacturing automation and optimization technologies. These projects will address pressing supply chain issues by migrating from declining manufacturing to a high growth industrial base, and will achieve cost reduction by optimizing the manufacturing design, assembly, and test processes.

The Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.

FY 16 – FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust.</r2:Text>

The Program will also leverage new battery manufacturing technologies for the supply chain that have been developed in SBIR - electrode laser cutting, solvent-free electrode production, low cost materials production or recycling, advanced performance cells. DLA will also complete the initial investments in manufacturing and material improvements for the vacuum electron tube supply base (used in microwave and radar systems) and pursue additional opportunities.

The Subsistence Network program plans to initiate and execute short-term projects in FY18, and continue efforts from FY17. SUBNET will also continue to pursue Small Business Innovation Research Topics in Subsistence. The Subsistence Network will also continue to work with community partners (military services, industry, and academia) to leverage the latest technologies, encourage innovation and modernization, and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain.

The Castings program plans to investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter. Contracts will be competitively awarded to fulfill those requirements. Projects will be required to include a business case with specific metrics and a transition plan for success. The Casting program will also continue executing projects approved and awarded in prior years. 

The Forging program will also continue executing projects approved and awarded in prior years. In addition, the Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.

Contracts will be competitively awarded to fulfill those requirements. Project will be required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging program will also continue executing projects that are approved and awarded in FY17.

DLA R&amp;D plans to leverage Industry and the Military Service Engineering Support Activities (via Service-level agreements with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force) and the Department of Energy by providing funding for AM work identified under the respective agreements. Desired outcomes include: acceleration of rapid qualification and certification methodologies for AM, identification of AM applications for castings and forging preforms, rapid cast production and repair of castings using AM, exploration of conversion of recyclable materials to AM material, improved reverse engineering processes for AM purposes, and optimization of metal AM production to obtain land, air and sea platform spare parts. These efforts seek to increase the number of AM parts qualified for procurement and achieve savings from the associated lead-time, storage costs, transportation costs, in some cases reduction of fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. Overall AM efforts will provide alternatives in product realization in order to address unfulfilled Warfighter readiness needs.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Quality Sources SFA are projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently.  Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  

Strategic Materials is a new area for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements. Targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE will begin a major new thrust in emulation to address Linear Microcircuits in addition to its traditional focus on Digital.  Several efforts will address basic design, manufacturing, electrical test and quality/reliability requirements for establishing a basis for product-oriented developments across the FYDP. MAE will also complete development and transition Advanced Schottky TTL Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also continue development of additional emulation capabilities including TTL-Compatible CMOS. MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of a 1 million gate Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and 512K Read-Only and Random-Access Memory Emulation Capabilities. It will complete prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.

Strategic Materials: A request for white paper proposals was recently added to DLA’s Emerging R&amp;D Requirements BAA for critical initial manufacturing technology requirements in domestic high strength carbon fibers.  Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.  Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.

The MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

The DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.

The Emerging Manufacturing Technology program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Emerging Manufacturing Technologies addresses the opportunities to start new manufacturing technology developments that occur out of the budget cycle. It is a new start in FY18.  Having an Emerging Technologies line allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs. In other programs DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off project start-up lead-times. Saving the startup lead-time allows the Agency to get advanced technology into the hands of the warfighter earlier that would otherwise be the case and begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case. It also allows ongoing programs to maintain continuity of funding and activity. SBIR phase III efforts (which can't be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging battery technologies, and technologies to address strategic materials shortage/risk.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, and combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate – including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLAs Generic Logistics R&amp;D Technology Demonstrations (Log R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available to accomplish the agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources and applying the most effective business processes. The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs. The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  

In December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&amp;D program in support of the agency’s mission. As a result, the R&amp;D program evolved from single supply chain efforts to Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs). The SFAs support DLA’s efforts to make the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness rates in a constrained budget environment. 

The three Strategic Focus Areas were renamed in FY 2021 to more clearly capture their focus and scope:  

1. Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (formerly Analytic and Decision Support): R&amp;D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.
2. Improving Logistics Processes (formerly Logistics Processes): R&amp;D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.
3. Emergent Logistics R&amp;D Requirements (formerly Innovative Products and Services for Customers): R&amp;D Efforts to support emergent Logistics R&amp;D requirements arising outside the budget cycle, a frequent occurrence.  The SFA begins new projects promptly without the disruption of ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes. 

NOTE: The single supply chain exhibits were removed as they are now included within the SFA exhibits.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>During FY 2017 – FY 2021  funds were realigned from PE LOG R&amp;D (0603712S) to the Industrial Preparedness – Manufacturing Technology Program (PE 0708011S). This realignment was needed to accommodate high priority requirements within DLA to improve the industrial base that supports critical weapon systems. In FY17, $4.646M was realigned from LOG R&amp;D to MANTECH for these high priority requirements.

A full-year FY 2017 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, the budget assumes this account is operating under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2017 (P.L. 114-254).  The amounts included for 2017 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution. BASE: FY17PB ($11.011M) + Request for Additional Appropriations ($0.000M).</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>R&amp;D efforts to develop and implement advanced analytical tools, modeling, and simulation of logistics and supply chain processes. These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible responsiveness to emerging market and customer requirements. Currently, there are three major analytical thrusts: Planning Processes, Medical Supply Chain, and Distribution/Disposition. Planning processes model simulates item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories, acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items). Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies. The Strategic Distribution and Disposition (SDD) thrust will develop and implement analytical tools, models, and simulations of logistics and supply chain processes related to distribution and disposition.

The Medical Logistics Network will expand efforts in medical informatics, a growing area of health information systems that combines information science, computer science and health care to improve health systems to manage the healthcare supply chain more efficiently.  

The mission of the SDD program is to assist DLA Distribution and Disposition Services in anticipating, assessing, and meeting current and future Warfighter requirements by leveraging R&amp;D to infuse innovative solutions. Current R&amp;D thrusts include finalizing a simulation study for the Eastern Distribution Center (EDC), battery desulfation and lithium battery upgrade projects in support of DLA Distribution, and a Hazardous Waste (HW) disposal feasibility study in support of DLA Disposition Services</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Strategic Distribution and Disposition (SDD) conducted a state simulation of DLA’s East Coast Distribution Center (EDC). The current state simulation was compared to new potential redesigns of the EDC. The most promising new designs were simulated and compared to the current state for labor savings, reduction in fulfillment time/cycle, and reduction of Material Handling Equipment (MHE).

SDD completed the Warehouse Automation and Robotics Exploratory Project (WAREP) and provided a Gap Analysis and an initial ROM BCA. Subsequently, J6 assumed responsibility for the initiative.</r2:Text>

To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. 

This strategic focus area has 2 thrusts: Technical/Quality (T/Q) Process Improvements and Selected Process Improvements

T/Q Process Improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters.  Services have engineering responsibility for most Class IX parts. Many T/Q sub-processes involve interactions with Service engineering functions, which often are time-consuming and costly.  Other key T/Q sub-processes are essential to the procurement function, such as analysis of parts content, source capabilities and problem resolution.

Selected Process Improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical/Quality (T/Q) function. Although all DLA processes are in scope, the focus for FY 2016 is on the Procurement process, especially aspects driving internal costs and delays in awards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs.  In the past DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times.  Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs.

DLA and the Military Services will identify lists of candidate parts for AM to be used for vendor solicitation. DLA R&amp;D has established AM Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), and U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), and currently developing MOAS with Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM). These MOAs will allow the Agency to begin the transition of AM as a new alternative into its procurements activities.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>USTRANSCOM is tasked to provide globally integrated, agile deployment and distribution solutions as well as related enabling capabilities to support national security, force readiness and sustainability within an increasingly constrained defense budget. Unpredictable/extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/area denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information, invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success, ensure the viability of our capabilities, and implement a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes as well as the ability to effectively collaborate/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote the effective/efficient/responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Synchronizing strategic/theater delivery capabilities to meet increasingly dynamic customer needs.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Theater Commander has not always been able to provide the appropriate security in a timely manner during deployment.  In some cases there are insufficient security assets to oversee convoy security in-country; therefore, all movement requirements are competing for the same limited resources.  Additionally need to explore new, portable methods of detecting hazardous/asymmetric materials in very small quantities to support safe logistics operations.  Also explore technologies to enhance the capability to deliver personnel/materiel to anti-access/austere airfields and seaports.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Capabilities which improve deployment, distribution and supply chain decision-making/collaboration (e.g., planning stage to real-time execution/retrograde operations) without need for highly specialized operators. Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion to include drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities. Current planning/forecasting/collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems to include the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need. Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces. The ability to rapidly determine the impact of any delays/changes and conduct "what -if" impact assessments on the closure of force packages is required. This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce low volume State-of-the-Practice (SOTP) and legacy microelectronics that are unavailable from commercial foundries. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing a guaranteed and Trusted source of supply of microelectronics parts that are essential to combat operations. In addition DMEA provides the rare technology capability to bridge the gap between research and application allowing DMEA to develop, manage and implement innovative microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  

This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. These threats include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned, their extended combat use increases attrition and the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases. 

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires low volume SOTP and legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. To meet these requirements, DMEA procures commercial licenses to organically produce semiconductor technologies that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and guaranteed source of these critical parts.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication expertise to ensure that the Department can field systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions – along with its unique technical perspective – allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.

Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now guaranteed to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.

These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production order. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence necessary in an industry partner to ensure them that their IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a weapon system operational, elevate its sophistication level or to meet new threats. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA
maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with
distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, guaranteed and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, and the incorporation of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands. 

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and are required to remain in service beyond planned replacement schedules, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing many systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities that might be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies as illustrated by the recent acquisition of IBM’s semiconductor manufacturing capability by GlobalFoundries. This acquisition, caused by economic pressures, has again highlighted the fact that commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. This trend is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other areas of defense interest, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Microelectronics program provides the Department with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. DMEA will focus on fostering all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted and assured microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Microelectronics access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>A full-year FY 2017 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, the budget assumes this account is operating under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2017 (P.L. 114-254).  The amounts included for 2017 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution. 
EFD Base: FY17PB ($3.800M) + Request for Additional Appropriations ($1.860M required to address emergency warfighter readiness. Funds are in support of the RDT&amp;E Project Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) Phase 2 Design, Development, and Deployment. These funds are needed to ensure continued on time development and software upgrades for EFD capability, specifically the SFIS/GL requirements required by 30 September 2017 to support DOD Audit compliance mandate. Additionally, these funds are needed to ensure remaining Phase 2 requirements are designed/deployed on time to eliminate on going excessive parallel data entry operations required from the DOD EFD user community. Such operations jeopardize data integrity and negatively impact audit readiness preparation efforts.) 
NGRMS Base: FY17PB ($8.831M) + Request for Additional Appropriations (-$8.831M realigned for NGRMS from the Defense Logistics Agency to OSD to align funding with the program office for more efficient execution.)

PB18 NGRMS was removed across the FYDP as the program has been fully sunsetted. Some of the NGRMS was omnibus reprogrammed to Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD).</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is a systems solution that specifically addresses the security clearance and suitability adjudicative requirements of Section 3001 of Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) and the Joint Reform Team's Security and Suitability Process Reform Strategic Framework as published in February 2010 which requires 90% of all clearances - whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential - to be completed within 60 days. The first 40 days is to complete the investigative phase and the remaining 20 days is to complete the adjudicative phase of the clearance review. In addition to national security clearance determinations, DISS supports Suitability and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) credentialing eligibility compliance across the Department of Defense (DoD). The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRTPA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce. 

The DISS is comprised of two key application components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS). Currently, CATS is deployed in multiple versions (V1-V3) at the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF); whereas the CATS component of DISS will upgrade CATS (V1-V3) technology stack and consolidate capabilities into a single baseline in FY2017. CATS (V1-V3) are operational fulfilling the requirements to receive background investigations and adjudicate national security, suitability and HSPD12 credentialing eligibility determinations via electronic and human adjudication processes. Historically, CATS electronically rendered favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret-level cases. New Tier 3 e-Adjudication business rules for access to Secret information were approved in September 2016. JVS will be used by the security management community to manage subject's access to information based on eligibility, communicate with the CAF, manage subject incidents, and additional subject details such as reporting, travel, and relationships. The DISS will incrementally deploy additional capabilities to address functionality gaps between DISS and the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). DISS will enable consistent standards throughout the collateral DoD Personnel Security, Suitability and HSPD12 mission areas. CATS (V1-V3) instances and JPAS, once fully replaced by DISS, will be decommissioned. JPAS is projected to be decommissioned in FY2019 but this may be adjusted based upon DISS deployments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The DISS CATS has been designated as the DoD non-Intelligence Community IT system for case management and adjudications by the 10 April 2009 USD(I) memo “Designation of the DoD Case Management and Adjudication Systems.”  Currently, CATS processes over 500,000 cases annually; electronically producing favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret level cases.

Further, the 3 May 2012 Deputy Secretary of Defense Memo “DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Consolidation” consolidated all DoD CAF into one consolidated DoD CAF responsible for personnel security adjudicative functions as well as favorable Suitability and HSPD-12 adjudications.  The DISS (CATS) is the DOD CAF’s designated IT case management system.

Achieving the above goals will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the national security community and the Federal government.  It will decrease the time required to get an individual through the investigation process.  It will strengthen and reinforce reciprocity throughout the federal community by eliminating redundant or incomplete investigations by standardizing adjudicative decisions and by making available to all agencies adjudicative determinations of the Federal government.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On May 09, 2013, the DISS CATS received a Full Deployment (FD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which acknowledged that CATS was operationally fielded at the five adjudication facilities and authorized the DISS PMO to enhance and field a consolidated CATS (CATS v4) and its associated portal in order to improve the lifecycle management of the CATS by consolidating the existing CATS applications into a consolidated CATS application that uses a single database.  The July 11, 2014 “DISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum” revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The  JVS Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed in FY15 Q2 and this initiated the Engineering Development phase in which the program will refine system requirements, configure the software, build functionality, conduct developmental testing, and plan for operational testing.  These activities will continue until a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) is made.

The DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities. DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program’s acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting. As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer. Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets. These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies. These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information. Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant. Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information. The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices. They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw
conclusions. Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements. The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>A full-year FY 2017 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, the budget assumes this account is operating under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2017 (P.L. 114-254).  The amounts included for 2017 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution. Base: FY17PB ($26.657M) + Request for Additional Appropriations ($3.800M required to address emergency warfighter readiness. Funds are in support of the production environment for new agencies and meet the additional vendor software server requirements as DAI updates the other portions of the DAI Suite including, Operating system upgrade, Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, and other applications/utilities to maintain currency with support. The increases will largely support Washington Headquarters Services and supported agencies. The data volume for WHS is roughly three times the volume of the largest DAI deployed agencies. Additionally, the growth in the number and size of attachments has resulted in higher storage requirements. This funding will also support additional equipment and services from Defense Information Systems Agency's Defense Enterprise Computing Center Ogden, UT.)

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness. Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.

The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.  The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.

The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.3 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).

DAI supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”. DAI is also aligned to the  DOD Agency Strategic Fiscal Years 2015-2018, Goal 5: Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, Key Strategic Initiative - Improving competitiveness through accountability and efficiency and SO 5.2: Improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness. The objective of the DAI system is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data.

The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay (P2P); Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Release (Rel) 1 provided an application upgrade to Oracle R12 along with (P2P) enhancements facilitating SFIS/SLOA compliance and automated Time and Labor absence management.  Rel 2 introduced Grants Financial Management accounting and the start of a phased implementation of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) capabilities. Future capabilities will support Rel 3 Direct Treasury Disbursing and Budget Formulation as well as Rel 4 Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).


DAI is currently implemented at 20 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 29,990 users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) assertion packages.

The benefits of DAI are:
•	Common business processes and Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS and SLOA);
•	Access to real-time financial data transactions;
•	Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
•	Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; and
•	Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO completed the Oracle R12 application upgrade.  The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.  

DLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  While the DAI PMO serves as systems integrator, niche activities; i.e. P2P, development, are contracted.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>A full-year FY 2017 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, the budget assumes this account is operating under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2017 (P.L. 114-254).  The amounts included for 2017 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution. Base: FY17PB ($4.949M) + Request for Additional Appropriations ($3.000M required to address emergency warfighter readiness. Funds are in support of system integration and development activities for design and testing; requirements development, testing, delivery not supported within the COTS software; a partial procurement of the Oracle PeopleSoft License; and a development of interfaces to the military branches of services and other departments such as the Veteran's Administration (VA) via the Global Exchange (GEX).

PB18 Increase to continue the development of the functional and system requirements of DRAS2.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than superior management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers.  It requires supply chain excellence.  Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe, requires that DLA-managed materiel flows seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit innovative technical applications of existing technologies to solve current and future agency requirements.  Proposals from the small business community will fulfill this requirement.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve a reasonable degree of technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit supporting a Phase II award. Direct impact on a DLA solution, future market possibilities and demonstrated commercialization potential have a strong influence on Phase II selections.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project explores innovative concepts pursuant to Public Law 106-554 (Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000) and Public Law 107-50 (Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001), which mandates a two-phase competition for small businesses with innovative technologies with a defense application as well as a commercial value.  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Industrial Preparedness Manufacturing Technology (IP ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters’ needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  

Beginning in FY16, DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  
•	The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly known as the Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  
•	Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future, it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. 
•	The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly known as Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) is an R&amp;D effort undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times, assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Subsistence Program (former Combat Rations Program), the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The Subsistence Network objective is to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain with the goals of leveraging the latest technologies, encouraging innovation and modernization, and to maximizing capability and capacity in subsistence. The areas of research includes: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packaging solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. The Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate, Optimize Combat Ration Inspection Costs, and Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project are current short-term projects that will have desired results such as improved processes, enhanced  quality of individual and group combat rations, reduced cost associated with combat rations inpsections, and increased efficiencies, then transition these improvements as applicable to industrial base suppliers and government suppliers. 

The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new material and technological solutions for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The Subsistence Network issued a new Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in July 2016 and will remain open for five years. The BAA projects have an expected duration of 6-24 months and the government plans to invest up to $18 million during Fiscal Years 2017-2021 for funding research in response to this BAA. The 5 MILMRE Menu Bag Test, a short term study  associated  with the Meals Ready-to-Eat (MRE) Chemical Laminate project was completed in December of 2016.
The work on three Short Term Projects (STP) (Optimize Combat Rations Inspection, Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), and MRE Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project) were extended at the government request in FY16 to fund additional research, development and testing of these projects. Further research and testing on the Optimize Combat Rations Inspection project will identify and test 18 cost savings measures. On the MATS project, a Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization Carrier Tray was designed and tested to optimize the product quality that the MATS can produce. The MRE Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project was extended to examine other subsistence storage and distribution points, including transportation systems and determine the temperature and humidity conditions that subsistence items are exposed to at the locations. The Small Business Innovation Research program Subsistence Topics were released in September 2016 and STPs were reviewed for consideration of Phase I selection in 2017.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Battery Network plan is to establish contract partners through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. A Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups will inform general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain and technology improvement. The plan also includes awarding Phase 2 and 3 projects from DLA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) in advanced battery manufacturing technology. 

The Subsistence Network Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the acquisition of research and development of short term projects was released in July 2016 and will remain open for five years, FY17 – FY21.  A Joint Steering Group made up of government representatives from the Military Services, DLA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Center, and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center will review ongoing projects, identify new areas for investment, assess proposed projects, examine procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA and DoD subsistence needs and requirements.

The DLA Castings R&amp;D Program involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in FY16 soliciting for new R&amp;D projects.  Evaluations will be completed in 2017, with multiple contract awards anticipated for 2017.  The current contracts reached the end of their base period of performance on September 30, 2016, which were also awarded under a competitive BAA in 2011. 
The DLA Forgings R&amp;D projects were awarded through a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Battery Network plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Subsistence Network plan is to execute reductions in cost for shipping, storage, supply chain process, inventory, waste and inspections, as well as reduced lead times for combat ration production, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and “market fresh."

For example, SUBNET will provide the following technical achievements: 1) a microwave-assisted capability to sterilize group-sized entrees and components, packaged in Institutional Sized Pouches (ISP) and Polymeric Trays and 2) identify and produce at least one or more alternate sealant layers that can be used by the rations industry to pack high acidic food products and to ensure uninterrupted supply of MRE rations. 

The Castings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Forgings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation.  

The Additive Manufacturing metric is the number of parts qualified for AM and the lead-time savings achieved to make small quantities of items.  

At least 30% of the completed projects will transition.   

OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Quality Sources SFA are projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently.  Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  

The Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE completed development and transitioned higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities into full-scale production, further increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned emulation capabilities address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE also initiated new implementations including development of TTL-Compatible CMOS Emulation Capability and development of reverse engineering and design capability for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). It continued developing 350 nanometer Digital Emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.  AME also completed initial development and capability assessments (gap analysis) to support a new major emulation thrust to support Linear Microcircuits beginning in FY2017.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DoD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.

The MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DoD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently, there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

The DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreate the design in contemporary engineering systems.   

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The MUST program completed plans to set up distributed pilots of the knowledge based approach. The pilots are developing and demonstrating a digital specification authoring tool, a 3D visualization tool, and technology to streamline the transition of requirements from the Services to DLA.  This technology allows DLA, its customers and suppliers to access, manage and share technical requirements in a common format. 

The DLIR program completed the Strategic Sourcing Tool Project which provided an automated and repeatable process with an accompanying application for rapidly identifying commercially available equivalents for stocked NSNs. 

Additionally, the DLIR program initiated the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Interoperability Project. Currently, technical part data must be manually aggregated and interpreted, and then re-entered and verified within the various systems used by the Services, DLA, and its suppliers, to ensure consistency of all requirements. This project will attempt to semi-automate integration of requirements within each system, improve exchange across systems, and ensure that all participants are made aware of changes that affect these requirements.</r2:Text>

The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)in October 2011.

 The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) continues to be at the forefront of improving disaster-reduction decision-support capabilities through the application of information, science and technology.  PDC's products and services enhance foundational and global services supporting civil-military humanitarian assistance operations by the US Military and US agencies, state agencies, United Nation agencies, ASEAN, national governments, and International/Non-Governmental Organizations (I/NGO).  Foundational and Global Services include projects supporting development, analysis, and delivery of relevant and actionable information.  These activities fall into three categories:  Global Information Services; Anticipatory Sciences and Socio-Economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessment; and Decision Support Platforms and Applications.

Emphasis areas in FY 2016 include:

•  Improve the simplified DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS user interface (a.k.a. "dashboard") for increased ease-of-use and situational awareness, while allowing the system to accommodate "no/low bandwidth" operational mode (enabling better support to mobile platforms, as well as, degraded communications) 
• Extend and enhance mobile computing and situational awareness platform for DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS to include:
   a) cross-device and cross-platform functionality, optimized for touch interface appropriate for mobile devices;
   b) limited "down range" data collection &amp; sharing capabilities (e.g., damage photos, voice memos, etc.)
   c) investigate and implement degraded but functional/operational "off-grid" capabilities
   d) investigate and implement user customization and data import capabilities 
• Enhance DisasterAWARE's social media/network visualization capabilities, in collaboration with partners such as ONR-funded research in the subject matter
•  Extend and enhance Bio Surveillance capabilities in collaboration with Navy and Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA)Bio Surveillance Portal (BSP) Joint Program Executive Office
•  Extend collaboration with DTRA &amp; other data providers in enhancing data fusion capabilities
•  Continue to emphasize and participate jointly- and externally-funded research and application programs to enhance the Center's capabilities and experiences which in turn can be operationalize and applied in direct support of DoD HA/DR and DSCA missions
•  Continue to grow competitive grants and proposals as a means to expand the center’s capabilities, and leverage these new capabilities in support of DoD missions</r2:Text>

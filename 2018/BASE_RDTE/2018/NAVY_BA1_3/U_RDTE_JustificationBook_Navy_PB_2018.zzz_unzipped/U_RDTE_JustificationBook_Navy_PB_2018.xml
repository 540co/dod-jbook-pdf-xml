            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enable the U.S. Navy to maintain technological superiority, and for university research infrastructure to acquire research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university research important to the Navy. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>DEFENSE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION PROGRAM (DURIP)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>DURIP funds are provided to universities to purchase relatively high cost research instrumentation that is normally not included in single-investigator type research grants. Individual grants range from $50K to $1.5M. The DURIP program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) interest item and OSD directs that funding for the DURIP efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.  DURIP is a one year program.

The FY 2018 increase reflects an additional number of DURIP awards.</r2:Description>

The MURI program is an OSD interest item and OSD directs that funding for the MURI efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramps up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by; speeding up scientific programs by cross-fertilization of ideas, hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI is a five year program.

The FY 2018 increase reflects an additional number of MURI awards.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of Naval power and national security, and by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs and providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). The Department of the Navy (DON) component responds to S&amp;T directions of the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.

This PE addresses DON Basic Research, which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention. Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.

This portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.

In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.

Due to the number of efforts in PE 0601152N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The ILIR initiative seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through the Naval Warfare Centers/Laboratories. It also supports the development of technical intellect and education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in a military laboratory environment. Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the Department of Defense is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise. It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science &amp; Technology Strategy approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board 
(20 Jan 2015). This new strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

This PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences. Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend. There are currently five NNRs.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge Program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise. It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science &amp; Technology Strategy. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

This PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences. Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support. Activities in this area also support maintenance of the Science and Engineering Workforce and STEM Education and Outreach.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), S&amp;T areas that are uniquely important to maintaining U.S. Naval superiority. With the designation in 2011 of Sea-Based Aviation as an NNR, there are currently five NNRs.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and collaborative departmental efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science that attract new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.

This program supports innovative basic research on physical process studies, fundamental observations, new sources of data, and modeling in the atmosphere and space with the goal of improving predictive capabilities in the major research area of Operational Environments. Emphasis is placed on the marine atmosphere, the tropics, polar regions, the ionosphere and other areas where new understanding is needed in order to overcome predictability barriers that limit the accuracy of current forecast models. Efforts are underway to understand the interactions of physics between the atmosphere, space, land, ocean and ice, represent these coupled processes in models, and extend them across scales from local to planetary, with the goal extending the skill of predictions to longer timescales (i.e. seasonal to interannual). Recent efforts have also focused on the processes that control tropical cyclone formation, structure and intensity changes and processes that affect electromagnetic and electro-optic propagation in the marine atmosphere. Accomplishments and plans described below are examples for each effort category.

Funding increase in 2018 is the result of several increased Department Research Initiatives in the areas of Extramural Marine Meteorology and Prediction, Intramural Battlespace Environments, Extramural Space Sciences, and Intramural Space Research.

Complete a research initiative to improve the sub-grid scale parameterization of clouds, radiation and mixing in the marine boundary layer that developed several innovative new "scale-aware" parameterizations; transition these to applied research and, in one case, directly into a new version of the Navy's global numerical weather prediction system (NAVGEM), which resulted in a major improvement of several objective measures of predictive skill related to clouds and precipitation over the oceans. Conduct high-altitude airborne field experiments over major hurricanes during which an unprecedented set of high-resolution soundings covering the full depth of the storms will be obtained that allow detailed physical processes to be observed for the first time. These results will be analyzed, applied to existing models and have demonstrated the potential to make a substantial improvement in the ability to predict intensity and structure change in tropical cyclones.

                                <r2:Title>SCIENCE ADDRESSING HYBRID THREATS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats (formerly Counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Sciences program provides research for Naval Forces to fight hybrid threats, and adversaries in expeditionary operations. Naval Expeditionary Forces need science advances to address a range of Basic Research challenges that result from physical and operational environmental limitations so harsh that solutions push basic discovery and invention. Naval Forces able to operate amphibiously and in the littoral will have all of their capabilities exposed to degrading sea and land physical effects. Expeditionary forces operating austerely must be agile and lethal but will be constrained by size, weight, and power requirements and must be sustained across distributed forces covering large areas. Further complicating the problem context is the nature of hybrid threats, and adversaries. 

A hybrid adversary can be state or non-state using a combination of conventional and irregular methods and weapons. For example a hybrid threat could use criminal acts in concert with conventional artillery and IEDs and in turn social media for combined effects greater and broader than the sum of the parts. These coordinated multivariate threats occur across the spectrum of conflict with a dynamic but unified strategy. A hybrid adversary is flexible and adapts quickly, synchronizing advanced state weapons systems, disruptive commercial technologies, cheap expedient homemade weapons, and a variety of tactics. The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats program seeks to establish and nurture science to address these threats not covered in more conventional warfare science efforts and in environments not researched elsewhere.

Within the above threat and environmental context numerous warfighting capability dependencies are considered resulting in a broad range of science research areas. Examples include: physics addressing the electromagnetic spectrum for use in Command and Control and high energy physics addressing Directed Energy Weapons; machine perception, reasoning and collaborative behaviors of autonomy enabling numerous potential expeditionary autonomous systems; artificial intelligence enabling future Intelligence systems; optics, electronics, and photonics research to enable revolutionary spectral awareness in small low power sensors; computer and network science to enable expeditionary computing coupled with Data Science research to conduct data analysis; fundamental chemistry and materials science research to advance technologies to support sustainment; basic materials research to explore and improve armor and structural materials; electrochemical energy conversion and storage research to sustain the force; chemistry and physics to provide disruptive energetics for expeditionary Fires; and biology, physiology, and cognitive sciences addressing the Naval Expeditionary warfighters human abilities.

The program also seeks to establish and nurture a multidisciplinary Science and Technology community of Government, academic and industry researchers to accelerate the transition of new science and technology into fielded systems.

Funding increase in 2018 is the result of DON increased basic research to include a complex, hybrid adversary consisting of state and non-state actors in order to better reflect the threat environment that Naval Forces will face in the future.

                                <r2:Description>Efforts include: The Ocean Sciences sub activity supports basic research in the ocean domain and the impact that this complex and changing environment has on naval operations. The effort encompasses research over a wide variety of regions, including the open ocean, Arctic, and littorals, and addresses scientific issues relevant to anti-submarine warfare (ASW) including acoustic propagation and the impact of acoustics on marine mammal behavior. The improved understanding of the ocean environment enables the development of fully coupled (ocean-atmosphere-wave-ice) global, regional and local predictive models that can be used for operational planning at tactical, strategic and climate scales. The program is strongly aligned with the Oceanographer of the Navy (N2/N6E) and the research topics addressed by this sub activity reflects the priorities for improved forecasts of the operational environment and the development and use of autonomous systems for the collection of environmental observations and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable science at sea. Research performed under this Sub Activity includes efforts in the following areas: littoral geosciences and optics, marine mammals and biology, physical oceanography and prediction, and ocean acoustics. Accomplishments and plans described below are representative highlights from these efforts.

                                        <r2:Text>Extramural Physical Oceanography and Prediction

Extramural Littoral Geosciences and Optics

Complete all efforts from previous fiscal years. Initiate development of methodologies and/or observing technologies which are: a) nimble, cost-effective, rapidly re-locatable, or will offer bold insight into littoral dynamics, or b) utilize sensors on operational platforms (termed organic) in ways which increase battlespace awareness or can be used to map the maritime domain while idle. Initiate studies and modeling of shelf, near-shore, delta, estuarine, and riverine dynamics, including surface and internal waves, currents, stratification, sediment transport and the seabed response and coastal winds driving shallow water response. Understanding shallow water features which will affect acoustic propagation or acoustic system performance and/or events which cause swimmer or navigational hazards (bathymetry-wave-current-wind interactions), navigationally significant bathymetry or trafficability changes, are of particular interest. Initiate studies using remote sensing of the coastal and riverine environment, above and below the sea surface and canopy, e.g., from EO, IR, radar, SAR, inSAR and acoustic, from land or ship-based, unmanned vehicles, airplanes or satellites. New remote sensing tools and algorithms that can be used to initialize forecast models in distant, remote and/or denied areas are of particular interest.  Initiate studies of optical processes in the littoral environment, including the atmosphere, sea surface, water column, sea bed and suspended or dissolved materials. Predicting the timing (initiation, transport and clearance) of materials that negatively affect optical clarity, is of particular interest.

Extramural Marine Mammals and Biology

Integrated Ecosystem Research - Conduct basic research to understand the patterns and causes of variability in the distribution and abundance of marine mammals over space and time. Initiate a multidisciplinary approach using tagging, visual surveys, and passive acoustics to collect baseline measures of marine mammal behaviors and distributions relative to environmental features and marine mammal prey fields. Investigate using animal tagging and passive acoustic monitoring to study behaviors and distributions of marine mammals relative to key environmental properties (biotic and abiotic).  This includes providing a context for interpreting behavioral responses to external stimuli (i.e. anthropogenic sound), and providing basic knowledge needed for predictive models of species of concern.

Effects of Sound - Conduct basic research on behavioral, physiological (hearing and stress response), and potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Initiate research to characterize the causal chain of events leading from sound exposure to "biologically significant" behavioral reactions that might increase risks of population-level effects and/or the potential for stranding. An additional focus is to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Conduct research into the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Initiate research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and/or bodies.  Another research focus is better understand the stress response in marine mammals to sound exposure. Conduct research to develop an understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize the relationships among hormones or other biomarkers in different matrices, define and compare the quantitative and temporal relationships of hormones across the different matrices, and evaluate and characterize the relationship between the physiological stress response in marine mammals and acoustic exposure and 'biologically significant' disturbance. Continue research to develop statistical models of the population consequences of acoustic disturbance to be fitted to data from marine mammal populations and lead collaborative development of transferable models of the effects of disturbance on marine mammals.

Monitoring and Detection - Conduct research to develop and test new and existing technology to detect and classify marine mammals in the marine environment and during periods of low light such as passive acoustics, and IR. Continue research and development of passive acoustic signal processing algorithms for detection, classification, and localization of marine mammals. Continue the development and testing of autonomous hardware platforms using passive acoustics and/or IR to detect and classify marine mammals using a variety of fixed, towed, floating, and profiling platforms.

Extramural Ocean Acoustics 

Conduct research to understand propagation and scattering of acoustic energy in shallow-water ocean environments.  Areas of research include: shallow-water scattering mechanisms related to reverberation and clutter; seabed acoustic measurements supporting geoacoustic inversion; acoustic propagation through internal waves and coastal ocean processes and the development of unified ocean/seabed/acoustic models, including scattering from rough surfaces, biologics and bubbles; and penetration/propagation within the porous seafloor.

Intramural Battlespace Environments

The overall objective of this research is to improve basic understanding of physical, seafloor and biological oceanographic processes on space and time scales of naval interest. Emphasis is on improved measurements, laboratory and model based experiments to quantify and understand important oceanographic processes that lead to the development of ocean dynamic models from global to submesoscale scales, and to couple these oceanographic models with atmospheric, ice, biological, sediment response, and optical models. Surveillance of coastal land areas and waters is important to support Navy operations and difficult. The Navy/Marine Corps needs include an improved use of overhead (airborne and satellite) active and passive microwave sensors, overhead optical sensors, surface-based (ships and ground-based) grazing angle microwave sensors. To predict bottom boundary physical, geological, geochemical, geoacoustic and geotechnical properties in shallow-water operating areas requires:  a) an improved understanding of processes that generate and modify the shape, structure and physical properties of the seafloor, subseafloor, ocean water column and ice-cover and topography/morphology;  b) use of rapid, airborne characterization of littoral environments including time-varying coastal topography, littoral bathymetry, sea-level height, land and seafloor sedimentary structures to explain/predict the observed changes; c) remote sensing of bulk properties of Arctic sea-ice over broad two-dimensional areas that previously could be sampled only at spot locations by in-situ sampling; and d) quantification of the influence of turbulence generated at the seafloor boundary layer on vertical mixing and stratification in shallow water outside the surf zone.</r2:Text>

It is centered on Naval S&amp;T efforts supporting Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). Outreach includes the encouragement, promotion, planning, coordination and administration of Naval Science and Technology. 

Funding also supports ONRG International Science Program whose mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research and the Naval Research Enterprise to effectively address current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future naval missions and capabilities. This is accomplished through PhD-level Associate Director scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America collaborating with international organizations and researchers through grants in innovative basic research, and establishing quality, relevant connections between international science and technology (S&amp;T) centers of excellence and DON, DoD, and other US Government organizations. The direct impact of this investment is to capitalize on international basic research during unprecedented and dynamic global interdependence, increasing the ability to solve DON S&amp;T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners during a time of budget constraints. Additionally, this investment builds global S&amp;T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners to enhance global security.

Funding increase in 2018 is the result of increased research initiatives in the areas of STEM and International Outreach.

                                <r2:Description>The ONR Basic Research Challenge (BRC) program was established in 2008 to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program. The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement.

Funding increase in 2018 is the result of the increased number of topics of research initiatives in the area of Basic Research Challenges.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Defense Basic Research seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through universities and government laboratories. It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment. Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia/industry team. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board.  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on directed energy, high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor technologies. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The DE program addresses the requirements of future Navy combatants to provide ship defense against the emerging threats that are proliferating throughout the Navies of the world. The Directed Energy portion of this activity consists of two elements. 

FY 2016 to FY 2017 decrease in funding is due to Solid State Laser Maturation Program (SSL-TM) program entering the fabrication and testing phase.

Effective in 2018, the SSL-TM funding moves to the new innovative naval prototype (INP) PE - 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Directed Energy and Accelerator Research:

-Continued to develop the most promising component technologies such as normal conducting and super conducting RF electron beam injectors, advanced high power cathode technologies, high power compact amplifiers, and advanced mirrors, coatings and optical components capable of handling the significantly higher energies for potential alignment in a Free Electron Laser.

Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation (SSL-TM):

-Continued the development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for maritime beam director, targeting and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy missions to defeat small boat swarms, UAV swarms, and provide potential ISR disruption and/or defeat. This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.
-Conducted lethality testing for notional solid state laser designs. This will include scientific studies of laser erosion, pitting, and ablation of various target materials for improved modeling and simulation that will support development of the governing technical requirements for a beam director and targeting system capable of performing Navy surface ship self-defense missions.
-Continued studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and including studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions. These scientific studies are critical to understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapons systems and interfaces.
-Continued trade studies on innovative solid state laser subsystems designs, based off industry available technologies or those technologies identified by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO). These investments will be considered "break through" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system.
-Continued scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance against key performance parameters.
-Continued scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent "safe-arm" function for the projection of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.) Of particular concern is the designs for safety in future laser weapons to halt laser energy propagation, while performing Navy surface ship self- defense missions, and avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g. friendly sensors or platforms.)
-Conducted component and subcomponent laboratory tests.
-Conducted Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for Tactical Laser Core Module (TLCM).</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE develops early components technologies that can be integrated into weapon systems that meet warfighter requirements.  Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. 

The metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development/demonstration program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this program element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Aircraft Technology activity develops technologies for reduced observables technology and enhanced capability of naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. It also develops new Naval air vehicle concepts and high impact, saleable naval air vehicle technologies, such as - autonomous air vehicle command and control, helicopter and tilt rotorsystems, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, materials, structures and flight controls for future and legacy air vehicles. 

Variable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT) will identify and mature critical, relevant variable/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR)/Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Structures and Materials program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools. 

These efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation. Related basic research efforts are addressed under 0601153N Defense Research Sciences. 

The funding decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to maturation of AACUS technology applied research effort.

The funding decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to AACUS and joint Tern programs moving to new innovative naval prototypes PE 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>FLEET FORCE PROTECTION AND DEFENSE AGAINST UNDERSEA THREATS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Fleet Force Protection and Defense against Undersea Threats efforts include applied research for complementary sensor and processing technologies for platform protection.  Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information.

                                <r2:Description>Technology programs focused on providing technologically superior warfighting capabilities at reduced total ownership costs for surface and subsurface platforms through investments in applied research and advanced technology development of programs in:  a) Advanced Naval Power b) hydrodynamics, c) structures d) autonomy for unmanned surface vehicles (USV) and e) platform survivability. This element also includes the National Naval Responsibility in Naval Engineering (NNR-NE).  The NNR-NE supports early applied research in the areas of propulsion, platform structures, hydrodynamics, automation control and system engineering, design tools, naval power systems and ensuring a strong and healthy academic infrastructure.  Specific research themes are:

Advanced Naval Power Systems Technology:
Advanced naval power systems efforts address electrical and auxiliary system and component technology to dramatically improve energy and power density, operating efficiency and recoverability from casualties. A major investment focus is providing the power and energy required for directed energy weapons on current and future surface combatants. Advanced Naval Power efforts include: developing technologies for high-power, cyber-secured energy networks, providing warfighting capability with more energy efficient systems; mitigate adverse impacts of alternative fuel on Naval platforms and equipment; and utilizing the Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC) efforts to develop modeling and simulation tools to provide critical design &amp; operational capabilities for the all-electric ship program, accelerate development and demonstration of technologies, reduce risk of new technology insertion and address the national shortage of electrical power engineers.

Develop new machinery integration concepts. Develop simulation based Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) methods and technologies.  Contribute to system reconfiguration.  Design a ship electrical system architecture based on a main bus that distributes "rough" DC power throughout the ship at nominally 10 KV.  Development of macro- and atomic-scale multi-physics models is being pursued to enhance understanding of materials processing &amp; performance, energy conversion mechanisms, cyber-physical energy concepts, and power management.  System-level studies focus on the scalability and reliability of component technologies.  Another thrust is the development of tools to model heat transfer at multiple length scales allowing for simulation of heat flow through the ship in order to evaluate the impact of power conversion electronics, sensors, and weapons on the overall thermal balance of the vessel.

Advanced Sea Platform Performance Technology:
Hydrodynamics: Critical platform design for surface ships hydrodynamics that is focused on the theory, computation, and lab and at-sea experimentation to develop understanding and prediction capabilities for all hydrodynamic phenomena associated with surface ships and small craft, their effects on vessel performance, and concepts for modification.  Propulsor hydrodynamics is focused on understanding the physics of flow around propulsors and their interactions to improve propulsor performance, mobility, efficiency, and affordability, as well as prediction and control of various types of cavitation on propulsors and appendages. This also includes predictive capability of cavitation inception, thrust breakdown, and erosion phenomenon and scaling laws. Technology efforts in the area of Subsurface Hydrodynamics include identifying, understanding, predicting, and controlling flow physics, as well as turbulence and stratified wakes.  This is further applied to Subsurface Maneuvering Technologies, and understanding the Dynamics of Interacting Platforms. Additionally hydrodynamic technologies focused on the signature aspects of the hull-propulsor interaction and maneuvering.

Platform Structures: Focused on time-varying, structural reliability analysis and prediction for a ship structural system with uncertainty quantification and propagation. Specific topics include novel structural configurations across composite and metallic materials and prediction methods for advanced global hull strength, local panel and component strength, fatigue and fracture strength, and seaway loads and load effects for high-speed/high-performance ships and vessels.  Hull life assurance addresses development of new structural system approaches for surface ships and submarines, including the management of weapons effects to control structural damage and the improvement of structural materials.

Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV): Autonomy for USVs and related mission functions aligned with Naval S&amp;T strategic focus on autonomy and unmanned vehicles. Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicle applied research includes short-term motion forecasting for recovery of USSVs on a host ship in higher sea states and determination of slamming loads on high-speed planing hulls for structural weight reduction Distributed intelligence for automated survivability addresses both the basic technology of automating machinery control systems, as well as, distributed control of systems utilizing autonomy for mission context based reconfiguration.

Sea Platform Survivability Technology:
Aligned with survivability S&amp;T strategic focus area, research investigates electromagnetic (EM) sources (including major ferro and non-ferromagnetic sources, eddy currents, and Corrosion Related Magnetic Fields (CRM)) that are associated with naval platforms.  Develop understanding of EM field propagation relationships and analysis aids, and technologies to predict the electromagnetic properties of a naval platform.  Advance physics based understanding of platform acoustics. Discover and develop algorithms and methods that will enable the development of improved design, analysis, and prediction tools for enhanced acoustic performance. Understand, design and develop optical and acoustic metamaterials to control light and sound propagation over a large frequency range.  New architectures to overcome challenges associated with loss, bandwidth, and scalability are being explored.  Design and develop models, algorithms, and integrated development environments for simulation and control of complex, interdependent, distributed shipboard machinery systems to enable integrated, autonomous operation and reconfiguration of shipboard machinery systems.  Efforts also include: signature reduction, hull life assurance, hydromechanics, distributed control for automated survivability (includes damage control), and advanced naval power systems. 

Signature reduction addresses electromagnetic, infrared, and acoustic signature tailoring, both topside and underwater. 

The funding increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the ramping up of the Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV) program and the Applied Research Challenge (ARC) effort. 

The funding decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the realignment of the Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV) Leap Ahead effort to a new PE 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research for consolidation of the Leap Ahead/INP portfolio.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Independent Applied Research (IAR) R2 activity was stood up in FY 2013 as the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to consolidate all NRE related IAR investments. Projects funded in this R2 Activity are intended to be approximately 2-3 years in length.  Based on historical trends approximately 30% of these projects will turn over each year.  The Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) encompasses the IAR efforts focused on solving a wide range of Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) fleet issues utilizing unique Naval Warfare Center (WC) laboratory capabilities. Efforts under this activity address the full spectrum of the DON S&amp;T Strategic Plan technology using focus areas which engage Naval aviation, sea surface, undersea, space, weapons, communication, information, and human systems. The IAR Program provides participating WCs with in-house funding for applied research to support the execution of their assigned missions by: 
-Developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems.
-Promoting the hiring and development of talented new scientists and engineers (S&amp;E) with the insurance of proper mentoring with senior personnel.
-Encouraging collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories. 

Funded projects are chosen through rigorous internal competition by each WC's selection committee and typically last two to three years.  IAR projects are generally designed to promote investment in high-risk/high-payoff research and also allow young S&amp;Es to manage Navy relevant research projects. A limited number of successful efforts developed under the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) basic research Program Element 0601152N are matured and further developed under the IAR program with the goal of transitioning these technologies to the warfighter.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element(PE)are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps) to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the USMC S&amp;T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) is the Marine Corps' foundational Capstone Operating Concept that provides vision and context for developing future operating and functional concepts that in turn guide capability development and this PE. Using future concepts, science and technology (S&amp;T) performers can focus less technologically mature applied research in areas where end state capabilities are not fully defined and on S&amp;T opportunities where feasibility is not fully developed or known but is also potentially game changing. EF 21 aligns with national level strategic guidance including the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Military Strategy (NMS), Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and with Naval strategy in the Department of the Navy's Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower.

Expeditionary Force 21 describes a future Marine Corps ground force that will have cornerstone characteristics of being naval, expeditionary, agile, and lethal. This force will face security environments and threats driven by Complex Terrain (to include informational and human aspects), Technology Proliferation (including precision weapons), Information used as a Weapon, Battles of Electromagnetic (EM) Spectrum Signatures, and Increasingly Contested Maritime Domains. The future Marine Corps will be designed to meet those future security environments but needed force characteristics also impose constraints and challenges on future operating concepts and capabilities. EF 21 provides the context in which promising and innovative applied research is explored to determine scientific feasibility of potential solutions and opportunities to enhance, change, or invent future concepts with S&amp;T. For example within the above naval force characteristics, amphibious operations against EM signature aware threats with advanced weapons systems will be part of future Marine operating concepts. Promising science opportunities in autonomy may enable new concepts and capabilities in agility, lethality, and signature management that have not even been defined. The EF 21 context brings constraints and challenges that stimulate unique science and technology (S&amp;T) requirements and opportunities that define this PE.

S&amp;T projects in this PE explore the feasibility of applied research to meet broad Marine Corps conceptual requirements within the unique constraints described above in the warfighting functional areas of: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver and mobility; force protection; logistics and sustainment; human performance, training and education, firepower, and Expeditionary Cyber. This PE funds applied research, future technology assessment and road mapping, future technology concepts, and less technologically mature projects within the Future Naval Capability (FNC) process as means to inform, enhance, and invent future concepts and capabilities with new S&amp;T.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity supports S&amp;T investment in Command and Control and is focused in three main areas:  (1) Implementing the FORCEnet concept (2) Developing decision support systems that enable warfighters to take advantage of the FORCEnet and MAGTF C2, and tactically extend Net-Enabled Command and Control (NECC) for shared situational awareness; and (3) Providing effective combat identification of enemy combatants, friendly forces, and non-combatants.  FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This activity develops ISR technologies for applications in future intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.  Technologies being pursued enhance situational awareness, persistent surveillance, and tactical decision making through automated analysis of data and rapid integration of information and acquired knowledge.  Specific technologies in this activity effectively present actionable information to decision-makers, especially those at the lower command levels.  This includes biometrics for expeditionary operations, complete future automation of options and persistent surveillance in support of distributed operations.

The FY2017 to FY2018 increase in the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance activity is due to strong demand signals from the Marine Corps to address Tactical Cloud Computing Challenges.  Effort has focused work on two fronts: connecting tactical clouds to each other and connecting tactical clouds to traditional Marine Corps Tactical Service Oriented Architecture in a contested operational environment.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>USMC FUTURE NAVAL CAPABILITIES</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity, formerly named Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP), addresses the applied research associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0602750N, where the Navy's participation in the FNC Program is funded.   The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval Technology Gaps generated by IPTs that are co-managed by Navy and the Marine Corps flag/general officers with representation across the naval research enterprise.  FNC funding is aligned to naval challenges that may be associated with any of the FNC focus areas (i.e., Pillars).  FNCs contain both 6.2 Applied Research and 6.3 Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity (BA) components as technology is matured from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.   

The FY2016 to FY2017 increase was due to a rephasing of the Tactical Edge Enabling Capability products of Actionable Information Tactical Applications, Data Condition, and Network Adaptive Communication Services.

The FY2017 to FY2018 decrease in the USMC Future Naval Capabilities activity is due to a realignment of funds to the Expeditionary Cyber Activity. Additional funding realignment within PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Demonstration ensures that the Future FNC funding will remain constant in USMC program elements.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Maneuver thrust area focuses on the development of technologies that will increase the warfighting capabilities and effectiveness of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). This thrust aims at capturing emerging technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Emphasis on survivability technologies includes defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics. These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies. The Thrust is also providing the USMC with affordable technologies that enable manned-unmanned teaming, autonomous vehicle collaboration, and ground vehicle mobility technologies for enhanced expeditionary maneuver.

The FY2016 to FY2017 increase in funding is due the re-phasing of the initiation of technology development programs to address expeditionary maneuver capability gaps.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms.  These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered radio frequency (RF) spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and RF challenged environments.  

The current specific objectives are:
a) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic/infra-red (EO/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.

b) Tactical Networking and Network Control/Management: 
Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.

                                <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop enablers for decision making and mission execution, to achieve battlespace superiority.  It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for C3 information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.  The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE supports the development of technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare.  Net-centric operations include communications and information assurance capabilities to enable all-source data access, tailored dissemination of information to Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) users across the network, and rapid, accurate decision making based on this information.  The operational benefits sought are increased speed of response, accuracy, and precision of command; distributed self-synchronization; flexibility and adaptability to an operational situation; and decision superiority.  

Specific examples of metrics under this PE include:
- Increase network data rates and interoperability across heterogeneous radios; improve dynamic bandwidth management and mobile network connectivity.
- Increase the understanding of the battlespace by the development of automated tools for extracting information from images and signals, identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and generating courses of action.
- Improve the integration of  sensors, networks, decision aids, weapons, and supporting systems into a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system.
- Improve integrated signals electronics packages in small, light-weight, and low-cost satellites to test new concepts for global ship tracking and two-way data exfiltration.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan which is developed from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.  

This PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities. Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the CNO and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. 

This PE also includes the Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG) International Science Program whose mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet/Forces (F/F), and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission is the Naval Science Advisor Program that develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon tour completion, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first-hand knowledge of the F/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. This program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This program supports the development of field medical equipment, diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous, deployment environments; including regenerative medicine technologies and therapeutic/restorative practices for the treatment of combat-related traumatic injuries. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>ELECTRONIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop technologies that enable the development of affordable, effective and robust Electronic Warfare (EW) systems across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) that will increase the operational effectiveness and survivability of U.S. Naval units.  Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats.  The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area.  This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies.  Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept.  

The objectives reported in prior years under this R-2 Activity have been consolidated into the current objectives described below.

The current objectives are:

- EW RF Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. 

- EW EO/IR Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO/IR) spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming/steering, and signal processing and transmission. 

- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack.

- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies: Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements.

- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.

Decrease in funding from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to:
- Completion of exploratory research into advanced technologies to counter emerging threats operating in higher bands of the radio frequency spectrum utilizing extreme spectral and temporal agility.

- Starting in FY 2018, all Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments in Electromagnetic Maneuver Command &amp; Control (EMC2) Warfare will be shown in the new INP PE 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research to better convey exactly what the Office of Naval Research is working on in this area.

                                        <r2:Text>The Electromagnetic Warfare applied research being conducted includes efforts in both RF countermeasures and EO/IR Countermeasure including both detection and defeat.  Technology developments to provide capabilities indigenous to small UASs are a significant focus.  Technology developments being addressed include laser based IR countermeasures, non-mechanical holographic means for optical beam steering for EO/IR countermeasures, the development of new optical lens technologies based on gradient indexed (GRIN) optics. This latter technology when coupled with another ongoing effort in multidimensional optics show significant promise for greatly reducing the weight of highly capable optical systems.  Additionally there is a focus on developing the high payoff technology of chip scaled integration of optical photonic components with microwave components.   Technology is being investigated to determine the potential for being able to conduct specific emitter identification and classification relative to gun blasts using IR imagers.   

RF efforts include work in developing engineered high transmit to receiver materials for significant improvements in isolation.  Work is ongoing to expand EW jamming capabilities at high power levels covering previously unaddressed frequency bands with significant operational impact.  The technologies to permit operations of EW attack in friendly communications bands without attendant fratricide is being researched using alternative technology approaches over current approaches.  Cognitive electronic attack approaches in both the communications bands and radar bands are ongoing to address the need to address and defeat unidentified RF pop-up threats.  Results have been obtained in ongoing research in metamaterials in the RF domain.

An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology.

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop millimeter wave (MMW) and sub-MMW power amplifiers for use in Naval all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, and communications systems.  The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through commercial off the shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE supports the development of technologies that address technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. Each PE Activity has unique goals and metrics, some of which include classified quantitative measurements.  Overall metric goals are focused on achieving sufficient improvement in component or system capability such that the 6.2 applied research projects meet the need of, or produce a demand for, inclusion in advanced technology that may lead to incorporation into acquisition programs or industry products available to acquisition programs.

Specific examples of metrics under this PE include:

- Provide a secure, over the horizon, on-the- move capability to communicate with higher headquarters at a data rate of 256-512 Kbps at a cost of $75,000.
- Provide an array configuration suitable for installation on aircraft that will support Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) data rates of 10.7 and 45 Mbps at greater than 150 nautical mile range.
- Develop prototype Ku band phased array apertures in a form factor suitable for installation on the CVN-78.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. 

This PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space &amp; Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the "key transformational capabilities" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides technologies that form the natural environment technical base on which all systems development and advanced technology depend.  Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed
at understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.

Major efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the Battlespace Environment (BSE), determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems, and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations, maintenance, repair and upgrades that enable applied research at sea and provides modeling and analysis for environmental compliance for ONR/NRL field work and active acoustic experiments. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.

Joint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Complete the effort to couple sediment models that use accurate numerical representations of coastal sediment dynamics with coastal optical modeling systems in order to accurately forecast the appearance and persistence of near-bottom turbidity layers and sediment re-suspension events.

Undersea Warfare 
Applied research focused on minimizing the logistics burden of persistently maintaining multiple sensors in remote or challenged locations.  The research emphasizes technologies leading to non-platform-based systems through novel power sources and power-harvesting.  For example, benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs) are prototype power supplies that generate power from the oxidation of sedimentary organic matter and are intended for marine deployed sensor systems presently powered by batteries.  BMFCs can provide power for long-term, uninterrupted operation of Anti-Submarine Warfare; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; and scientific systems otherwise limited in operational lifetime by battery depletion.

Battlespace Environments 
Conceptualize and perform laboratory, field, and numerical modeling studies to understand and exploit various geoscience and optical environmental phenomena in areas that are scientifically challenging, require innovation, and are of interest to the Navy/Marine Corps. Encompasses the design, performance, analysis and underlying theory of field and laboratory experiments designed to understand geological/geophysical, biological, and optical phenomena in the oceans and littoral zones, and to validate that understanding. Includes efforts to develop new or enhance existing shipboard, in-situ, airborne, and spaceborne sensors and appropriate inversion and though-the-sensor techniques to obtain, store, utilize, merge and/or exploit data and create operationally and tactically useful environmental information of the littorals and bottom. This includes specification and development of sensors, signal processing, inversion, and other analysis tools when needed.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The marine atmosphere affects most aspects of naval operations. This activity develops observing technologies, models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems and Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that describe the atmospheric environment and its impacts on naval sensors and operations. This activity focuses on uniquely marine aspects of atmospheric science such as air-sea interaction, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, EM and EO propagation, coastal meteorology, Tropical Cyclone (TC) prediction, and the use of remote sensing to obtain quantitative observations of atmospheric properties. Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide NOWCAST and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.

NOPP, established by the US Congress (Public Law 104-201) in Fiscal Year 1997, is a unique collaboration among 15 federal agencies involved in conducting, funding, or utilizing results of ocean research. NOPP's value to the Navy derives from the capacity of the partnership to enable and ensure multi-agency efforts where such collaboration enhances efficiency or effectiveness, and/or reduces costs. Generally, NOPP investments are made on topics that cross-agency missions, fall in gaps between agencies and/or are too large for any one agency to fund itself.</r2:Description>

This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.</r2:Description>

The capability to provide ASW sensor and system performance models, realistic simulations, and measures of effectiveness that incorporate and exploit critical environmental knowledge requires coupling ocean dynamics and acoustics, ambient noise characterization in the littorals, acoustic and optical scattering and propagation characterization, through-the-sensor measurement techniques for in situ environmental parameters, measurement and prediction of uncertainty, and development of tactical decision tools.

Efforts include continuation of applied research to enhance passive sonar performance capability in the Arctic environment by developing a better passive sonar performance prediction model and new acoustic ice-characterization methods.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop naval tactical uses of knowledge of the physics of the ocean within the BSE. This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L) provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment.  These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.  

This program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element , as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization. Technologies being developed within this project are aimed at enabling Sea Shield which is one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap. Associated efforts focus on new ASW operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments. Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) DISTRIBUTED SEARCH</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US/Allied ports. "Non-covert" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments. 

Funding increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the increase in the number of objective experiments and the demonstration at the end of FY17 for the FDECO program and the associated integration events associated with the FDECO program.

Funding decreases from FY 2017 to FY 2018 due to the move of the Forward Deployed Energy &amp; Communications Outpost (FDECO) INP Program to a new innovative naval prototype PE 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes Applied Research.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Precision Localization focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies which use information from surveillance or search systems to determine an area of uncertainty (AOU) relative to target range, bearing, and depth adequate to handoff to an attack system. Precision Localization employs non-acoustic techniques such as magnetic and optical sensing to highly localize submerged threats. The objective is to increase magnetic sensor range and robustness, enable deployment on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and increase optical sensing search rates. Efforts include the development of non-traditional tracking and advanced magnetic and electric field sensors and processing. These technologies will provide a decreased AOU size thus enabling the effective use of smaller, more versatile torpedoes as well as increased performance gain in detection, targeting, tracking/trailing, and homing via target acquisition and covert prosecution.</r2:Description>

The related technologies support the conduct of covert, wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas, and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats, including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth, acoustic communications links.

The research in this program supports Navy environmental compliance information needs and facilitates acquiring LOAs from NOAA that enable all Navy training and testing operations, and the development of appropriate state-of-the-art mitigation measure.

The marine mammals research conducted in this Program Element (PE) represents part of a total effort executed in coordination with complementary research performed in PE 0602435N Ocean Warfighting Environment Applied Research.

This Activity has been created specifically to address the work associated with determining and mitigating the effects on the behavior of marine mammals of manmade sound transmitted underwater.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Integrated Ecosystem Research:  Conduct research using animal tagging and passive acoustic monitoring to study behaviors and distributions of marine mammals relative to key environmental properties (biotic and abiotic). This includes providing a context for interpreting behavioral responses to external stimuli (i.e. anthropogenic sound), and providing basic knowledge needed for predictive models of species of concern. 

Effects of Sound:  Conduct research on behavioral effects to potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Initiate research to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Conduct research into the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Initiated research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and/or bodies. Conduct research to develop an understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize acute and chronic effects of the stress response on individuals and populations of marine mammals. Continue research on potential effects of Navy sources on marine mammal behavior, life functions (e.g. feeding, breeding, migrating), vital rates (e.g. adult survival, reproduction), and population level effects. Understanding the effects of naval activities on species or stocks of marine mammals, including effects on annual rates of recruitment and survival.

Monitoring and Detection:  Continue research and development of technology for detection, classification, and localization of marine mammals. Continue the development and testing of new autonomous hardware platforms using technology to detect and classify marine mammals using a variety of fixed, towed, floating, and profiling platforms.

Models &amp; Databases:  Conduct research to provide tools to support environmental compliance efforts and decision-making related to how marine mammals are affected by anthropogenic sounds.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and, ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity, as is FNC Management.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.2 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea. This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three "key transformational capabilities" required by "Sea Shield" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within "Sea Strike" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

It supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and MCM-related FNC ECs. Efforts in Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technologies for longer range detection and classification of mine-like targets and magnetic gradiometer sensing and electro-optic (EO) technology for buried mine identification, and sensor integration onto Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are being addressed. EO sensor research develops algorithms to enable image processing for rapid overt reconnaissance from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Other processing, classification and data fusion techniques to reduce operator workload, and a mine burial prediction "expert system" are also being developed. Efforts also support development of MCM Mission Modules for Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program and its associated Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments.  These investments represent game-changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.    INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities. The projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging technology development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future.  The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to further develop the demonstrated capability.   These investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy, with new INPs approved by the 4-star RDT&amp;E Corporate Board.  

Developing INPs and Leap Ahead Technologies requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements. The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs. These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, as well as other pre-Milestone B efforts such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts.  

This is a new PE for FY 2018 that consolidates all Navy 6.2 Applied Research investments funding INPs and their associated LA-Tech investments into a single Navy 6.2 PE.  In FY 2017, these investments were spread across 4 separate 6.2 PEs:  0602114N Power Projection Applied Research , 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research, 0602271N Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research, and 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments within this portfolio to be viewed in one place.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 INP and LA-Tech investments in a single place.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6.  All prototypes developed within this program require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure the investments conclude with a demonstration proving the feasibility of the new technological capability in relevant environment.   The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments as existing ones are completed.  Successful demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities, requiring significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  

INPs and LA-Tech investments, including FY17 jump start efforts, have been collectively grouped into R-2 Activities that include Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy / Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber and Undersea Warfare.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue the TPCP project, previously funded in PE 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.  Develop leap-ahead resilient cybersecurity tools that will enable our warfighting platforms to fight through current and future unauthorized cyber intrusions and assure command and control of any naval platform (submarine, surface, and air platforms) providing an adaptive cyber toolkit and real time cyber sensors.  This project develops cyber sensors and automated vulnerability assessment cyber tools that deliver comprehensive defense-in-depth cyber capabilities to monitor, detect, mitigate, and recover from cyber threats in near real-time.   This project will develop software based capabilities and a compact and affordable computing appliance applicable to any aircraft, surface vessel, submarine or ground vehicle.  The technical development will leverage dynamic and active sensing and cyber vulnerability prevention science and technology approaches, including formal methods, model checking, and static/dynamic analyses which reduce cyber platform attack surfaces, prevent the exploitation of system vulnerabilities, shorten detection timelines, and perform other mitigation functions.  Commercial off-the-shelf software components will be leveraged to develop technology for de-bloating and delayering so as to reduce the attack surface and ensure platform resiliency against unauthorized cyber intrusions.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>INP:  Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG)

Continue EMRG, previously funded in PE 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research. The EMRG capability will support Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC/FIAC) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions. Conduct applied research addressing the unique technical challenges inherent in the construction, assembly and operation of an Electro Magnetic (EM) railgun prototype capable of launching long range projectiles repeatedly, many times per minute.  Special materials and compact sub-system components will be developed that are capable of operating in harsh thermal and electromagnetic environments. Advanced modeling tools will be developed to assess design options, analyze system concepts and inform experimental hardware design and testing.  

Develop and test next generation battery energy storage and pulsed power components to assess performance and applicability towards future designs.  Develop and refine algorithms for controlling the precision timed electromagnetic pulse used to fire the railgun in the rep-rate mode.  Conduct material, physics and thermal property research for long-life, rep-rate electromagnetic launch systems and actively monitor performance to understand the high currents, elevated operating temperatures, and cooling of components, so as to improve designs and increase their reliability.  Develop modeling and simulation tools that support electromagnetic launch, multi-shot life development, testing, and assessments.

LA-Tech:  Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM)

Complete the SSL TM project, which was previously funded in PE 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research. Finish development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for a maritime beam director, targeting, tracking and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy surface ship defensive missions to defeat small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms, and which provide Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and/or defeat. This effort includes conducting scientific studies that address the modeling and simulation critical to understanding the missions involved in a layered defensive capability in the maritime environment.  Conclude testing against threat representative targets, components and subsystems to determine weapon capabilities and lethality. These tests provide data that support improved modeling and simulation and the development of governing technical requirements for an integrated High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon system capable of conducting Navy surface ship self-defense missions.  Finish studies of atmospheric scattering, absorption and turbulence effects in low altitude, maritime, surface conditions, which provide critical data for understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapon systems effectiveness.  Complete scientific studies and testing on laser subcomponents, including tests on laser pump diodes and laser gain media. These laser subcomponent technologies have potential in future weapon acquisition programs that are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research that is suitable for use in the maritime domain.  Conclude scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons and provide an inherent 'safe-arm' function for the projection of laser power at long range (potentially beyond visible, line-of-sight distances). The capability to halt laser energy propagation in real time while performing Navy surface ship self-defense missions is necessary to avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g., friendly sensors or platforms).  Conduct testing of the laser weapon system demonstrator, including a Tactical Laser Core Module (TLCM).

LA-Tech:  High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS)

Continue HIJENKS, a joint USAF/USN project previously funded as a FY17 Leap-Ahead jump-start effort in PE 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research.  Develop a High Power Radio Frequency (HPRF) technology payload integrated on an air platform capable of engaging multiple electronic targets with a single, scalable effects weapon across a variety of warfighting missions.  This effort will culminate in a live-fire demonstration of a multi-mission/multi-target HPRF payload integrated into a demonstration platform.  The operational impacts include decreased cost exchange ratios, non-kinetic counter electronic effects, reduced collateral damage, and the ability to engage multiple targets with a single weapon.  This effort aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.  During FY18, the following applied research development efforts are planned: investigate Radio Frequency (RF) effects on complex electronic systems with the goal being to finalize an RF waveform specification; investigate HPRF weapons effects for non-kinetic counter electronics to include the prediction model improvements required for mission planning of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW); perform Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) to capture RF antenna output, RF propagation, RF interaction with complex enclosures, and RF interaction with electronic circuits to characterize DEW performance to the maximum extent possible; conduct research into the time-out of action or recuperation time for complex electronics, exploring Battle Damage Indicators (BDI) for electronic disruption; determine the critical pulsed power and RF components required to reduce the HPRF payload's Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP); perform a trade-off analysis of the technology alternatives, their maturity, and their suitability for this application; develop the most promising component technologies, such as conformal antenna designs for high power, advanced high power RF source technologies, pulsed power components with higher energy densities, and advanced architectures and magnetic materials for high voltage power electronics systems; conduct risk reduction research for the RF source and antenna subsystems by examining high risk, high payoff technology alternatives to improve output power while simultaneously reducing system size and weight, and examine the efficiency of each subsystem and the impact of overall payload prime power requirements.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>INP:  Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) 

Complete the AACUS project, which was previously funded in 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.  The AACUS project will complete research efforts to develop and mature technologies that perform autonomous take-off, conduct en-route navigation, classify the terrain of landing zones, detect and avoid ground-based obstacles, and safely operate in degraded visual environments.  In addition to maturing these individual technologies, specific attention will be directed toward the task of integrating them into a full scale autonomous platform to increase their technology readiness level.

INP:  Claws

Initiate Claws.  Claws will develop the autonomy required to operate large and extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in an anti-access, anti-denial environment.  To support large and extra-large UUV operations further forward and farther from the battle group, the technology will be evolved to allow operations with limited navigational fixes and limited communication opportunities.  During FY18, research will be conducted and technology will be matured in the areas of precision navigation, obstacle avoidance, robust communications, on-board vulnerability assessment, and payload autonomy.  Applied research efforts in advanced undersea autonomy will also be initiated.

INP:  Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV)

Complete the LDUUV project, which was previously funded in 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research.  The LDUUV INP is developing the critical technologies of energy, autonomy, endurance, and submarine launch and recovery.   These critical technologies are needed to enable Large UUVs to be pier and ship launched, and recovered. The technologies will enable the completion of missions with long ranges, as well as those requiring over 60 days of endurance for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) tasks.  Continue development of the long endurance, air-independent energy source technology for large UUVs.  Continue development of the autonomy technology that will support operation of the UUV in the littorals.  Continue development of core UUV technologies that will extend the reliability and endurance of the UUV operating in the littorals.  Conduct a UUV fuel cell systems technology analysis, which will be used to support a land-based demonstration.  

INP:  Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)

Continue the LOCUST project, previously funded in PEs 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research and 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.  LOCUST will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of military operations and areas of operations.  LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses.  This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution.  The applied research effort in 2018 specifically will conduct preliminary system design and technology developments within the three major LOCUST sub-systems: (1) the Distributed, Collaborative, Coordinated, &amp; Cognitive autonomy system architecture; (2) the distributed Command &amp; Control system architecture; and (3) a series of modular UAV payloads.  

LA-Tech:  Large Displacement UUV - Advanced Power and Energy Demonstration (LDUUV-APED)

Continue LDUUV-APED, which was previously funded in PE 0602747N Undersea Warfare Applied Research.  The LDUUV-APED Program is integrating the Aluminum Power System (ALPS) air-independent fuel cell system into an existing LDUUV vehicle and conducting at-sea testing to demonstrate a mission endurance capability that meets the Navy's UUV far-term objectives (up to 70 days) for a persistent forward presence.  During FY18, the hull structural design and analysis will be completed and the energy section hull will be fabricated.  Integration of ALPS into the energy section hull will begin.  Modifications to the vehicle to accept the ALPS energy section will begin.  The notional mission profiles will be finalized and development of the test plan will begin.  The vehicle-level hazards analysis will be completed and the range approval process will continue to be supported. 

LA-Tech:  Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV) 

Continue MDUSV, which was previously funded in 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.  The MDUSV project will continue research efforts to develop and mature technologies in multiple areas that will be used to assess the feasibility of an MDUSV to perform Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Electronic Warfare (EW) mission area requirements.  Autonomy technologies being matured include a robust perception approach using Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors and technologies that enable autonomous all-weather operations, detection of low radar cross section craft, reduced vulnerability to jamming, and operations with reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions.  MCM technologies being developed include mine sweeping capabilities using High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) magnets in combination with acoustic sweep technologies.  ASW technologies being developed include an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) to be assessed for its autonomous ASW track and trail capability.  The project also includes development of an NTSS EW payload integrated with an MS3 Sonar.  These emerging technologies are being designed and developed for an MSUSV prototype that will be capable of performing multiple autonomous missions over extended periods of time.  

LA-Tech:  Tern

Complete Tern, a joint ONR and DARPA project, previously funded in 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research. Continue airplane launch and recovery component and subsystem technology developments to enable medium size, long-endurance, long-range Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to be launched and recovered on short deck ships.  Continue the maturation of technology addressing integration challenges associated with developing a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV capability.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports ONR leadership, management and direction for the Naval S&amp;T program. This project funds ONR HQ Non-Management Headquarters Activities (Non-MHA) salaries, communications, and other fixed costs. ONR sponsors scientific advances, which lead to Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs), supporting the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority. Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&amp;D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&amp;D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&amp;D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances. This project also supports ONR Non-MHA management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs:  Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program. 

Additionally, this project funds ONR field salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>- Continued kill-chain studies to identify and recommend engineering trades to enable weapon system
interoperability and data fusion alternatives. These studies assess engineering feasibility of various kill-chain
options and assess the capability provided.

Continue EMRG.  The EMRG capability will support Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC/FIAC) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions.  Design, fabricate and integrate Electro Magnetic (EM) railgun subsystems and components into a system prototype capable of rep-rate operations.  Assess the manufacturability of major components such as the railgun launcher and pulsed power modules, which are key to the technology capability. Conduct preliminary prototype system tests and demonstrations to prove the technological feasibility of the EMRG capability and assess sub-system and component operability under stressing rep-rate conditions.  Continue developing and testing a prototype rep-rate railgun launcher that is suitable for installation in a prototype railgun gun mount, where the design of the power and energy architecture necessary to support the prototype EMRG system can be assessed.  Continue to test and build full-scale electro-magnetic railgun system prototypes that include the battery charging system, the pulsed power subsystem, and the electromagnetic launcher.  Perform full-scale testing of long-life railgun launcher material solutions inserted in laboratory launchers.  Design, build, test, and evaluate iterative electromagnetic railgun composite launcher prototypes to demonstrate the technological feasibility, performance, multi-shot life, and suitable firing rate of the system.  Continue activities to integrate and test a Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) for use with the EMRG.

Continue SSL TM.  Continue development of a maritime laser weapons system prototype and test it on a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant. Conduct the required laser weapon system engineering, design, integration and testing necessary to have a testable, experimental prototype. This system will be capable of supporting missions such as defense against small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and defeat.  The results of scientific and engineering trade studies, including those that measure atmospheric absorption and turbulence, will be used to support the integration and testing of a maritime beam director and a high power, Solid State Laser (SSL) capable of tracking and engaging surface and airborne targets at a relevant stand-off distance in the maritime environment.  A Hybrid Predictive Avoidance Safety System (HPASS) will be integrated with a solid state laser weapon system demonstrator to de-conflict laser operations with friendly sensors and platforms. At-sea testing will be conducted on the full laser weapon system demonstrator (i.e., prototype) from a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

This PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 January 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This activity also includes development of affordable wideband, high performance Advanced Multifunction Radio Frequency (AMRF) apertures.  A portion of this PE is devoted to mid-term technology development in close concert with acquisition programs of record.  The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition program of record.

a) Advanced EW Enabling Technologies - Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. 

b) Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20) - Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.

The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 reflects an increase in the level of effort for the new Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) Program. 

The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects the realignment of the EMC2 Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) designated program to PE 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Advanced Technology Development where all of the INP/LA-Tech investments are being consolidated.

                                <r2:Description>The objective is to develop a System of Systems (SoS) able to coordinate distribute electronic warfare (EW) resources against many adversary surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. It will benefit the warfighter by providing platform protection across the battlespace against many sensors, creating seamless cross-domain countermeasure coordination, and enabling rapid advanced technology/capability insertion to counter emerging threats. 

a) Develop reconfigurable and modular EW payloads, Distributed Decoy and Jammer Swarms (DDJS), effective multi-spectral countermeasures (CM), and Multiple Input/Multiple Output Sensor/CM (MIMO S/CM) for platform protection across operational domains.

This R2 activity was initiated in PE 0602271N Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research and expanded in FY 2015 to PE 0603271N Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology.

The decrease from FY16 to FY17 reflects the transition toward the integration and demonstration of the new technologies.  

The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects the realignment of the NEMESIS Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) designated program to PE 0603801N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Advanced Technology Development where all of the 6.3 INP/LA-Tech investments are being consolidated.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 January 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps) to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) S&amp;T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&amp;T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) is the Marine Corps' foundational Capstone Operating Concept that guides capability development, wargaming, and experimentation and this PE. EF 21 aligns with national strategic guidance including the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Military Strategy (NMS), Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), and with Naval strategy in the Department of the Navy's Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower. 

EF 21 describes a future Marine Corps ground force that will have cornerstone characteristics of being naval, expeditionary, agile, and lethal. This force will face security environments and threats driven by Complex Terrain (to include informational and human aspects), Technology Proliferation (including precision weapons), Information used as a Weapon, Battles of Electromagnetic Spectrum Signatures, and Increasingly Contested Maritime Domains. The future Marine Corps will be designed to meet those future security environments but needed force characteristics also impose constraints and challenges on required capabilities. An example would be a need to conduct Information Warfare but with systems constrained by size, weight, and power considerations necessary for a naval and expeditionary force. Another example is Marine firepower requirements to be lethal against technologically comparable threat systems but Marine capabilities and weapons constrained by deployment and sustainment challenges of naval shipping and a distributed expeditionary force. These capability constraints and challenges in turn drive unique S&amp;T requirements that define this PE.

S&amp;T projects in this PE enable future force capabilities through advanced technology development to meet Marine needs within the unique constraints described above in the warfighting functional areas of: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver and mobility; force protection; logistics and sustainment; human performance, training, and education; firepower; and Expeditionary Cyber. This PE funds advanced technology development, technology demonstrations, assessment of emerging technologies, experimentation in warfighting concepts, and the Future Naval Capability (FNC) process as means to develop unique Marine future capabilities with new S&amp;T.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Critical Marine Corps requirements/imperatives addressed in this Project are: Maneuver; Force Protection; Human Performance, Training and Education; Logistics; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) , Expeditionary Cyber and Firepower.   These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. 

In addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Naval Future Naval Capabilities Program. The USMC Future Naval Capabilities Activity, formerly named Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP), addresses the advanced technology development associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.    The eight Expeditionary Warfighting Areas support the the Technology Maturation  portfolio investment.  The USMC FNCs support the Technology Maturation/Acquisition Enabler investment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity addresses the applied research effort of the Human Performance Training and Education thrust (HPT&amp;E).  The HPT&amp;E thrust investment profile is directed at two technology investment areas, Warrior Resilience, and Decision Making and Expertise Development. Warrior Resilience efforts are focused on advanced training technologies and methodologies that enhance neural, cognitive, and physical readiness.  Decision Making and Expertise Development efforts are focused on training and education technologies and methodologies that accelerate the development and improve the retention of skills in decision making, situation awareness, and individual and team adaptability and coordination on decentralized, dynamic and dispersed battlefields.

The FY2017 to FY2018 decrease in HPT&amp;E investment is due to completion of an agent-based surrogate instructor development environment (ASIDE), the acceleration and completion of a Marine augmented classroom environment (ACE) effort that will enhance instructors' teaching performance training to optimize the use of resilience skills (TOURS) and the completion of the USMC Basic School's project to test the efficacy of simulation based training in the school's curriculum.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>USMC FUTURE NAVAL CAPABILITIES</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity, formerly named Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP), addresses the advanced technology development associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0603673N  Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development, where the Navy's participation in the FNC Program is funded.   The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval Technology Gaps generated by Integrated Process Teams (IPTs) that are co-managed by Navy and the Marine Corps flag/general officers with representation across the naval research enterprise.  FNC funding is aligned to naval challenges that may be associated with any of the FNC focus areas (i.e., Pillars).  FNCs contain both 6.2 Applied Research and 6.3 Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity (BA) components as technology is matured from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.   

The FY 2017 to FY 2018 increase in the USMC Future Naval Capabilities Activity is due to realigning funds within the PE for the initiation of the Fuel Efficient Technology Suite and Water Speed Enhancement efforts in FY 2018.</r2:Description>

Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into four pillars:  efficient and responsive force sustainment, planning and directing logistics operations, logistics demand reduction, and fleet maintenance.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.

The FY 2017 to FY2018 decrease in the Logistics Thrust Activity is due to the completion of infrastructureless In-Transit Visibility (ITV) technologies to enable asset tagging, tracking, locating, and monitoring anywhere in the expeditionary supply chain, as well as the completion of multiple energy related projects to include storage and hybrid smart grid technologies.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a subordinate organization under the Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&amp;I), the mission of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory / Futures Directorate (MCWL/FD) is to identify future challenges and opportunities, develop warfighting concepts, and comprehensively explore options in order to inform the combat development process to meet the challenges of the future operating environment.  DC, CD&amp;I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for Science and Technology (S&amp;T).  MCWL's Commanding General (CG) is the DC, CD&amp;I designated Proponent of USMC S&amp;T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&amp;T.  The MCWL/FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.  

The current MCWL/FD Campaign Plan addresses how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) called for in the Secretary of the Navy's "Cooperative Strategy 21" and the Marine Corps' capstone "Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21)" concept, according to the objectives of the Commandant of the Marine Corps' guidance to develop the future Marine Corps Force 2025.  Execution of the MCWL/FD Campaign Plan results in recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  In support of the Marine Corps' role to provide an ever-ready quick strike force to protect US interests, MCWL/FD pursues concepts and new capabilities focused on the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The MAGTF is the Marine Corps' doctrinal, task organized, force deployment package.  It consists of four elements:  the Command Element that provides overarching command and control (C2) of the entire force; the Ground Combat Element normally built around a core infantry unit with supporting armor, artillery, and other ground units; the Aviation Combat Element which provides aircraft, air defense, and other aviation functions; and the Logistics Combat Element which consists of combat service support (CSS) elements including medical, supply, and transportation.  Marine Corps Force 2025 also seeks to maximize the employment of electronic, information, and cyber warfare, as well as manned/unmanned teaming, within each element of the MAGTF.  MCWL/FD also examines future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment.  MCWL/FD accomplishes its mission through five subordinate Divisions:  

Futures Assessment Division's (FAD's) mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks. 

The mission of Concepts and Plans (CAP) Division is to:  examine select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges, and Naval warfare and joint/coalition integration and capabilities, in order to develop Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS to promote development of the emergent Marine Corps force.  CAP is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.

Wargaming Division conducts formal wargames to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and identify opportunities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities. 

Experiment Division conducts live force concept-based experimentation to facilitate exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  

Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Division conducts investigations and assessments to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL/FD investigates the relevance to EF21 capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following EF21 derived Thrust Areas:  Command, Control, Communications, and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Autonomy and Robotics; MAGTF Fires; Maneuver; Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy); Expeditionary Medicine; Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW); and Force Protection. 

MCWL/FD investments encompass inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  CSS and Force Protection; MAGTF C4; MAGTF ISR; Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT (CSS) AND FORCE PROTECTION</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This activity includes MCWL/FD CSS and force protection experimentation efforts including assessment of equipment, new Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), training programs, and proposed organizational changes associated with enhanced capabilities.  Although this category covers a few small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by MCWL/FD, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact.  Investments in this activity may be conducted under the Thrust Areas of Expeditionary Logistics, Expeditionary Medicine, Force Protection, or Autonomy and Robotics. 

The FY 2016 to FY 2017 increase in category funding is attributable to a shift in radar technology use (due to lack of technological advances as well as availability), while investigating systems that can identify, neutralize, or destroy unmanned systems.  This realization led to increased costs due to exploring additional/alternative radar capabilities.  In addition, increased emphasis on logistics enablers, prototype autonomous air delivery technology purchases, and expanded efforts to enable standoff detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) caused funding to increase.  

The funding increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is primarily attributable to initiation of the integration and experimentation with DARPA-initiated Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) developed technology for a full scale, modular multi-mission unmanned air system (UAS).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This activity includes Marine Corps Warfighting Laboraroty / Futures Directorate (MCWL/FD) efforts in the development and assessment of joint and service warfighting concepts, joint and service missions, analysis of emerging threats and opportunities, and joint capability experimentation.  It also includes MCWL/FD service experimentation in areas that impact multiple warfighting functions.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by MCWL/FD, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near-real-time operational impact.

The FY 2016 to FY 2017 increase in category funding is attributable to increased wargaming and involvement/participation in joint arena technology demonstration programs with an ultimate aim to rapidly field needed capabilities by capitalizing on emergent technologies and innovational operational concepts.

The FY 2017 to FY 2018 decrease in category funding is due to:  reducing funds provided for joint programs in order to focus on assessing FY 2017 investment outcomes/progress as well as the completion of experimentation focused modeling and simulation development/assessments.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L) provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.
  
This program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next-generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the research and development of next-generation NLWs and includes performing analysis, technical development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these NLWs.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materiels (including materiels for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next-generation NLW systems focus on long-range localized NL effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.3 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As discussed in Section A, there are a significant number of FNC technology products within this PE.  In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy's FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning and adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

All Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Improve target detection, localization, and tracking and increase attack capabilities by providing the following capabilities:
- Localization of 85% or more of enemy submarines in far forward or contested waters with false locations of less than 10% of total calls.
- Effective cueing of an attack from a distance of up to 200nm.
- Improvement of the Lightweight Torpedo (Mk 54). Specific improvements are classified.
- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4/day.
- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.
- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%. Array handling will be compatible with the existing TB-29 handling system.

Increase sensor to shooter performance and the effective lifetime of distributed ASW search systems by:
- Achieving a drifting active distributed system lifetime of at least two days in areas of tactical significance while maintaining required system performance with a minimum number of sensor nodes.
- Maintaining an effective lifetime of a month for mobile active distributed systems when subjected to the action of eddies from a major ocean current.
- Predicting reseed 6 hours before performance degrades.
- Holding the Area of Uncertainty (AOU) to no larger than 10 nm2 for an hour after initial detection through the control of the coherent sources.

Through a combination of better Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) command-level training and improved operator training provide the following:
- Improve the ability of active sonar operators to detect targets and reject potential false alarms compared to current simulation based training.
- Increase Pd by 50%.
- Provide a decrease in FAR by a factor of two.
- Provide a reduction in the probability of a hit on a High Value Unit (HVU) by a factor of two.
- Improve the ability of the ASW Commander to position assets to increase coverage, reduce active system interference and deal effectively with competing missions.
- Reduce training cost by greater than 80% and increase the frequency of training opportunities by greater than 600% relative to live training.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the development of recent technology breakthroughs to meet current operational needs from a subscale proof-of-principle into a full-scale prototype for warfighter experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations, Fleet Battle Experiments (FBE), Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) and sea trial exercises. The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) ONR Experimentation (OE) develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions; and (5) support for the Naval Precision Strike Operations, providing the Navy capability to quickly locate, target, and strike critical targets.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE. 

FY 2016 included a single year investment for the research in Directed Energy (Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation or SSL-TM) which explains the funding decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017. A new activity was moved into this PE in 2018 - Precision Strike Technology, formerly funded in PE 0603114N Power Projection Advanced Technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The objective of this project is to capitalize on recent technology breakthroughs to develop and integrate components including subsystems into prototypes quickly. These technologies are provided to the warfighter for experimentation, field experiments, and/or tests in simulated or actual environments. The use of Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) events is encouraged and the net results are to gain the knowledge that only an experiment can provide.  

Increase in FY 2017 will support emergent opportunities to meet fleet needs with advanced technologies including demonstrations and experimentation with Electronic Warfare, Undersea Maneuver Warfare and Advanced Autonomy technologies.  

Decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to completion of increased products in the areas of Autonomy, Electromagnetic Warfare and the exploitation of unmanned systems. Funding is back to expected level.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>SwampWorks seeks to develop and demonstrate technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe. The general nature of these efforts are high risk/high reward and constitute a leap ahead in capability or technology. Some of these technologies may become part of a follow-on technology development, may end up in the hands of the warfighter for Fleet/Force experimentation, or may culminate in a significant Fleet/Force exercise that demonstrates capability then transitions into the Acquisition Program of Record (POR).

FY 2016 included a single year investment for the research in Directed Energy (Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation or SSL-TM) which explains the funding decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017. 

The funding decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is reflects fewer products in unmanned systems.</r2:Description>

- Initiate projects in response to the Chief of Naval Research and the Chief of Naval Operations priorities as well as technologies of interest for the Pacific Area of Responsibility (AOR).
- Under the leadership of the Director of Research at ONR, the SwampWorks portfolio explores high-risk, disruptive, and innovative technologies and concepts, and provides a venue to develop innovative technologies.  All SwampWorks activities are targeted towards advancing the capabilities of naval warfighters. Because of the portfolio's high-risk nature, brief exploratory studies can be performed to examine the maturation of the technology proposed before making substantial investments. The SwampWorks program has substantial flexibility in planning and execution which includes a streamlined approval process to allow for the shortest possible technology development timeframe. The balance of the S&amp;T projects that will start in FY18 will be identified during FY18 as the needs of the warfighters, for investments in this portfolio, evolve or change. SwampWorks is not limited to any set of technology areas. The portfolio is open to great ideas all year long and invests in innovative technology development that will ultimately provide a dramatic improvement for the warfighter.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015) and investment directions as defined by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5160.62 "Single Manager Responsibility for Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology and Training (EODT&amp;T)" and approved by the DoD Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program Board (Sep 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance, input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). The strategy is also based on the unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century.  The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&amp;T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE develops and demonstrates prototype technology for Mine Countermeasures (MCM), US Naval sea mining, and Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore. Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces. Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat. Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations. Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective. Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs. This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports advanced development for battlespace shaping weapons including advanced undersea weapons.  It supports the MCM related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs). Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.

The increase in FY 2017 is due to the transfer of research efforts and activities previously conducted in the Advanced Sea Mines Future Naval Capability (FNC) effort (SHD-FY16-OSD Modular Undersea Effectors (MUSE)) from PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development to PE 0603782N Mine and Expeditionary Warfare Advanced Technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity focuses on developing and demonstrating technologies to support a standoff or remote capability for detection and location, diagnosis, render safe, neutralization and enhanced access.  Efforts include: electromagnetic, electro-optical, and acoustic sensors and systems for detection of explosive threat components including explosives, device housings/containers, and triggering mechanisms, standoff identification and confirmation of trace explosives, fusion of multi-sensor input for high confidence detection and diagnosis of buried threats, highly dexterous manipulators and imitative controllers for lightweight, efficient (strength/weight ratio) dual manipulator systems integrated onto EOD robots for enhanced access, enhanced robotic autonomy to support EOD missions, data compression and visualization techniques to support precise render safe and neutralization, and neutralization devices containing reactive materials to neutralize devices with low collateral damage. 
 
This S&amp;T investment supports the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and DoD EOD Program Board validated requirements for Joint EOD missions. This S&amp;T investment provides critical S&amp;T transitions to acquisition programs.  This investment in Joint EOD S&amp;T is reported annually to the DoD EOD Program Board. This S&amp;T investment is documented in the DoD EOD Applied Research Program Plan which is reviewed and approved annually by the DoD EOD Program Board.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program and its associated Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments.  These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.  INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities. The projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging technology development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future.  The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to further develop the demonstrated capability.   These investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy, with new INPs approved by the 4-star RDT&amp;E Corporate Board.  

Developing INPs and Leap Ahead Technologies requires the development of subsystems and components, and efforts to integrate these subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and tests in an appropriate environment.  The efforts funded within this PE include concept and technology demonstrations of components and subsystems, which may be form, fit and function prototypes or scaled models that serve the same demonstration purpose.  The goal of these development efforts is to prove the technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  By demonstrating the general military utility and direct relevance to identified military needs, the pre-Milestone B technology becomes available for transition and further development within an emerging or new Program of Record.  INPs and LA-Tech investments do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but they do have the goal of moving out of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and into the acquisition process within the future years defense program (FYDP).

This is a new PE for FY 2018 that consolidates all Navy 6.3 Advanced Technology Development investments funding INPs and their associated LA-Tech investments into a single Navy 6.3 PE.  In FY 2017, these investments were spread across 5 separate 6.3 PEs:  0603114N Power Projection Advanced Technology, 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology, 0603271N Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology, 0603747N Undersea Warfare Advanced Technology and 0603758N Navy Warfighting Experiments and Demonstrations. The consolidation in this PE allows all investments within this portfolio to be viewed in one place.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 Advanced Technology Development INP and LA-Tech investments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>INP investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6.  All prototypes developed within this program require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure the investments conclude with a demonstration proving the feasibility of the new technological capability in relevant environment.   The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments as existing ones are completed.  Successful demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  

INPs and LA-Tech investments, including FY17 jump-start efforts, have been collectively grouped into R-2 Activities that include Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy / Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber and Undersea Warfare.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue the BA 3 effort for the TPCP project, previously funded in PE 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development, which will develop leap-ahead resilient cybersecurity tools to enable our warfighting platforms to fight through current and future unauthorized cyber intrusions and ensure command and control of any Naval platform (submarine, surface, and air platforms) by providing an adaptive cyber toolkit and real time cyber sensors.  This project develops a prototype and will demonstrate cyber sensors and automated vulnerability assessment cyber tools that deliver comprehensive defense-in-depth cyber capabilities to monitor, detect, mitigate, and recover from cyber threats in near real-time.  Relevant naval cyber tools will be developed and tested to verify the technology can autonomously perform cyber vulnerability assessments and implement mitigation strategies that protect naval platforms from unauthorized cyber intrusions.   New cyber autonomy tools will be developed to protect critical naval warfighting capabilities supporting multiple missions, including time critical strike, expeditionary warfare, anti-surface warfare, and anti-air warfare.  These tools, which rely on cyber components, will be developed and demonstrated over an extended period of time at several integrated hardware in-the-loop facilities across the Naval Research Enterprise.  Optimized cyber resiliency warfighting effectiveness will be developed and demonstrated.  The technology will be developed to protect common layers of cyber functionality in hardware components, and local, system, and peripheral buses.  The protection will be extended into the system BIOS, hypervisor, operating system, middleware, the application space, and the network infrastructure.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>INP:  Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS)

Complete the AACUS project, which was previously funded in PE 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development.  Continue development of the design and build of a prototype sensor suite and software package suitable for integration and testing on an existing USMC rotary wing aircraft that will enable the capability for optional unmanned autonomous flight.  Conduct development and planning for a demonstration of the system's ability to autonomously perform an assault support mission in an operationally representative environment. This demonstration will include performing autonomous take-off, conducting en route navigation, approaching and landing at multiple unprepared landing zones using supervisory control managed by a minimally trained Marine via a tablet-based application, detecting and avoiding ground-based obstacles, and safely operating in degraded visual environments.

INP:  Claws

Initiate Claws.  Claws will develop the autonomy required to operate large and extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in an anti-access, anti-denial environment.  To support large and extra-large UUV operations further forward and farther from the battle group, the technology will be evolved to allow operations with limited navigational fixes and limited communication opportunities.  During FY18, at-sea testing of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 research technologies will be initiated in a realistic environment.   At-sea data will be collected to support the further development of Claws technologies emerging out of the Claws applied research effort in PE 0602792N.  Analysis of promising technologies will be conducted using laboratory and at-sea testing to provide realistic performance data.

INP:  Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV)

Complete LDUUV, which was previously funded in PE 0603747N Undersea Warfare Advanced Technology Development.  Continue progress developing a prototype LDUUV and demonstrate the autonomy technology that enables the LDUUV to avoid undersea static obstacles, operate in a variety of currents, and adapt to local environments so as to maintain station. Conduct development, testing and demonstration of the endurance technology and recommend a reliability strategy allowing for 30 days of continuous operations.  Conduct a demonstration of the LDUUV fuel cell system installed in an LDUUV vehicle operating in an Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) like mission for 60 days.  Continue to document the data analysis from the technology development in order to transition the information to Program Executive Office for the Littoral Combat Ship.

INP:  Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)

Initiate the BA 3 technology development effort for the LOCUST project, which will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of military operations and areas of operations.  LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses.  This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution.  During FY18, the LOCUST program will begin to develop a range of key technologies that will be integrated together in order to demonstrate a scalable system of inexpensive, commoditized, swarming UAVs that provide disruptive capabilities.  Critical milestones for each major sub-system and system will be established, as well as a revisit to requirements and metrics throughout.  Yearly wargames will be utilized to shape and inform the demonstrations, which will be of increasing complexity in both mission and operating environment.  The demonstrations in turn will provide the Navy with an ability to spiral out capability as needed.  FY18 demonstrations are planned to encompass missions utilizing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and kinetic strike payloads.

LA-Tech:  Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV)

Continue the MDUSV project, which was previously funded in 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development.  The MDUSV project will design and build a prototype MDUSV platform sized for theater or global independent operations.   New autonomy, Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies will be integrated into the MDUSV platform.  The capability of the MSUSV to autonomously perform ASW, MCM and EW missions over an extended period of time will be demonstrated during a 40-day period of at-sea testing.  The capability to autonomously operate in all-weather conditions, using new technologies that provide robust perception using Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors that detect low radar cross-section craft with reduced vulnerability to jamming and reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions, will be assessed.  The use of integrated acoustic and High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) mine influence sweep technologies as well as a novel ASW sensor suite that includes an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) will be tested on an instrumented range.  

LA-Tech:  Tern

Complete Tern, a joint ONR and DARPA effort, previously funded in 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development.  Continue TERN technology development by conducting hardware and software testing and a sea-based Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) flight demonstration.  The developed Tern enabling technologies have been focused on supporting a DDG-51 and LCS-2 based future long endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) capability that could be transitioned and implemented with minimal ship modification.</r2:Text>

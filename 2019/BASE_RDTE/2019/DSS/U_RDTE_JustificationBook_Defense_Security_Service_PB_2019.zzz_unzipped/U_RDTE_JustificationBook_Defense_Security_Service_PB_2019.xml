                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY19 funding can be attributed to the delays in the NISS Incremental 1 development contract award in Q4 FY15 and the new SIPR infrastructure required for the implementation of NISS Increment 2.  Increment 2 will require expanded licensing for Oracle OBIEE and licensing required from the company Software AG Government Solutions (SAGGS), which were not originally taken into consideration.  The application will also introduce new cost drivers such as Cross Domain Solution (CDS) and expanded MilCloud footprint as DSS moves forward to comply with the DoD mandate of Cloud-First.  NISS will be a driver for secondary/COOP utilization of MilCloud services.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Security Service manages the Enterprise Security System (ESS) to provide an effective, real-time, security support capability for the Military Departments, DoD Agencies, the NISP, and other Federal Agencies.  In compliance with the Expanded Electronic Government, President’s Management Agenda, and the DoD Enterprise Architecture Framework, ESS is the unified offering of security mission systems which facilitate and automate improved national investigative standards, streamline security processes, and increase DoD community collaboration.

The DSS Mission Information Technology (IT) systems provide critical service to the major DSS mission areas for Industrial Security Oversight and Security Education.  DSS performs this critical function through operation of its mission production systems to include the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), the DSS Gateway, and the Security Training Education and Professionalization Portal (STEPP).  RDT&amp;E for DSS mission systems primarily includes pre-planned product improvements to the applications, researching and improving assured information sharing to better posture systems and networks against vulnerabilities, ensuring self-defense of systems and networks, and safeguarding data at all stages for the DSS to increase efficiencies by providing web-based systems to manage certification and accreditation activities. These IT systems are as follows:   

Office of Designated Approving Authority (ODAA) Business Management System (OBMS).  The OBMS will automate the approval and certification process of cleared industry’s classified information processing security plans and operations.  This will increase mission efficiency by providing a web-based system to manage certification and accreditation activities, provide improved reporting capabilities to support DSS and industry through improved metrics, accreditation timeliness and accuracy and reduce the number of unaccredited systems by providing automated notifications to DSS and industry.  

EFCL:  The eFCL will be a centralized repository for information of facilities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). The eFCL will capture facility information relating to a cleared facility, from the initial processing of the facility clearance, the record decision pertaining to facility clearance request, to include Foreign Ownership Control or Influence (FOCI) information, as well as decommissioning the facility clearance, and capturing the DSS oversight activities.  The eFCL will provide a means for users to submit, update, search, and view facility verification requests.

Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  ISFD is the main DSS mission system that tracks and executes the National Industrial Security Program for DoD and 31 other Federal Executive Agencies of cleared industrial security facilities.  The ISFD provide users with a nationwide perspective on National Industrial Security Program related facilities, as well as, facilities under DSS oversight in the DoD conventional AA&amp;E program. ISFD provides source data for the DoD Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and the Facility Verification Request (FVR) application.

National Industrial Security System (NISS, formerly known as Field Operations System (FOS).  The NISS is slated as the next generation enterprise capability, replacing the Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD).  Additionally, NISS will provide seamless integration of other DSS systems and applications, such as eFCL, OBMS, DD-254, and Mobile Workforce Applications.  NISS will provide DSS with comprehensive enhanced capability to manage its entire mission portfolio.  NISS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data in the hands of field representatives for decision-making.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  

The National Contract Classification System (NCCS).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires a DD Form 254 be incorporated in each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and classification guidance necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required to perform on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation’s classified information is properly safeguarded.

National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) formerly known as Identity Management (IdM).  NCAISS is mandatory for compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program Management Office and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD-NII), Joint Task Force for Global Networks Operations (JTF-GNO) Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 06-02, CTO 07-015, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo 11-11 (M-11-11), directing accelerated use of PKI across the enterprise.  This initiative is designed to enable multiple DSS business systems to have service-accessibility that is controlled through PKI-compliant single sign-on authentication.  Potential expanded use of the NCAISS across the DSS enterprise to provide CAC-based authentication for business support applications to support the SIPRNet and JWICS domains, provide enhanced identity and access control analytics. It will also incorporate any remaining DSS operated application into the DSS NCAISS solution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>DITMAC will provide the Department's first truly quantitative and qualitative analytic overview of insider threat related risk trends, which will significantly inform future decision making.  The DITMAC follows an analytics-driven approach to assessing risk and endeavors to employ a rigorous science-driven approach to addressing risk and risk mitigation as it pertains to Insider Threat in the Department. Automating insider threat reporting, and aggregating data from throughout the DoD and federal government will potentially save lives and money through thwarting insider threats and leaks. Automation of integrated tools will offset increasing manpower needs. The system will also be available to the components for use, reducing the costs overall for new Insider Threat system development and sustainment throughout the DoD. 


FY 2017 Accomplishments:
Continued development of existing capabilities to better serve the insider threat community, while beginning the system re-architecture design to make the technical capabilities more flexible and adaptable, increasing communication/information sharing, decreasing cyber vulnerabilities, and cost savings each year in software licensing and technical support. Initial pilot deployment to 11 DoD Components for use as internal case management system.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Basic Research funds support research across physical, material, engineering, computational, and life sciences directed toward increased knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of observable phenomena associated with the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

DTRA's Basic Research effort is the Nation’s only basic research portfolio solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD).  It provides for the discovery and development of basic knowledge by research performers from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry. This investment helps motivate the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions, advancing the body of CWMD knowledge, and improving knowledge of research efforts that support nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management. These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a basic research portfolio under DoD’s Chemical and Biological Defense Program. 

Each year, program and technical managers conduct formal assessments of the portfolio, leveraging deep Science and Technology (S&amp;T) expertise within DTRA, as well as from the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group, independent external panel reviews, and other CWMD-focused stakeholders. This coordination facilitates unique, CWMD-relevant basic research while eliminating unintended duplication of effort in the broader defense S&amp;T community.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project, as the nation’s only basic research portfolio solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) CWMD mission areas.  This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.  

This project aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.  The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  

This project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD.  The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation.  Each individual research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions.  This research will enable new capabilities to: better understand the environment, threats and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and/or dispose of WMD threats; and safeguard the force by managing consequences.  Each program manager's portfolio leverages a wide range of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, information and network sciences and focuses basic research on the CWMD mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Applied Research program element funds the expansion and application of basic scientific knowledge in order to develop novel materials, devices, systems, and methods supporting next generation concepts and technologies that enable advances in WMD surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification.

This Applied Research portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction established annually by DTRA.  The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances DTRA’s Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by balancing the following imperatives: invest in DTRA’s applied research capabilities and increase the CWMD technology base to maximize future pay-off; capitalize on opportunities to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges that must be resolved prior to system-specific technology investigations and development; and ensure applied research efforts are directly aligned to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The increase in FY 2019 is due to the net effect of increased investment to counter Improvised Explosive Device/small Unmanned Aerial Systems (IED/sUAS) (i.e., Tier 1 and 2 UAS, including rotary and fixed winged), a realignment of funding to program element 0603160BR for CWMD terrorism support, a realignment to DTRA's Operations and Maintenance portfolio in support of the Defense Threat Reduction Analysis Center (DTRIAC), and lower economic assumptions for inflation.  The funding level in this program element continues to reflect the impact of incremental Service Requirement Review Board reductions, as part of the Department of Defense reform agenda, for consolidation and reduction of service contracts.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities.  The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project.  On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.

DTRA’s Counter - Improvised Explosive Device / Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED/C-sUAS) efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD strategic deterrence system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment.  This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration.  These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group.  The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This capability provides structured and systematic end-to-end test event planning, preparation, management, execution, and data analysis.  It also offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management.  The facility leverages 50 years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferent nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD.  Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the Department of Defense (DoD) and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DTRA provides DoD up to an 18-month “head start” on addressing critical warfighter gaps, and enables DoD to deliver the most technologically advanced response to improvised threats.  These capabilities are developed from previous JIDO experience and in concert with OGAs, National Labs, Academia, Private Industry, and International Partners.

This project employs Technology Outreach as well as development of modeling-and-simulation and analysis support tools to identify and validate urgent and emergent capability requirements and associated gaps.

**Project RR title changes from Combating WMD Test and Evaluation to Countering WMD Test and Evaluation beginning in FY 2017.  The funding level in this program element continues to reflect the impact of incremental Service Requirement Review Board reductions, as part of the Department of Defense reform agenda, for consolidation and reduction of service contracts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Advanced Technology Development program element funds the development and testing of subsystems and components for integration into prototype systems with the potential to transition into mature, state-of-the-art WMD surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification capabilities.

The Advanced Technology Development portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives as well as with Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction which is established annually by DTRA.  The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) Efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&amp;T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability.  Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.

DTRA’s Counter- Improvised Explosive Device / Counter - Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED/C-sUAS) efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.  The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort develops and integrates sensing technologies with multi-mission Unmanned Aerial System payloads.  (2) The Countering WMD (CWMD) weapons effects effort develops modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations.  (3)  The Innovative Technologies and Engineering effort takes promising technologies discovered under fundamental and basic research and further develops them to increase the effectiveness of weapons against blast doors and other underground structures for functional defeat of Underground Facilities (UGFs), WMD, and their delivery systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and to (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Counter Improvised-Explosive Device (C-IED) Counter Improvised-Threat (Counter-IT) Technology Demonstration, Prototype Development, and Testing program element supports the development, demonstration, and testing of defeat technologies for advanced wireless signals, compatible electronic counter-measures for IED and IED-facilitation defeat/neutralization, miniaturized and integrated sensors, hand-held detectors, and cutting edge Information Technology enabler capabilities. 

This includes providing and enabling open, fully sharable information, and analytical software tools; situational understanding of the threat's tactics, techniques, and procedures (what is urgent and emerging); C-IED and related C-IT material solutions prototyping, experimentation, development, and delivery; and training integration support to ensure deploying and deployed forces' readiness is sustained as new equipment and methods are delivered.
 
Assist Situational Understanding (JS) of threat-network activities. The IED and other disruptive improvised threats represent a continuing and irregular threat for deployed U.S. and coalition forces. In order to counter the threat, a deep understanding of IED and improvised threat use and facilitation is required. This DTRA capability is enabled by an advanced information technology infrastructure, analytical software tools, deployed and embedded DTRA operations integrators and intelligence analysts, and current and integrated operational data. Supported by CONUS-based reach-back linked to the intelligence community, the inter-agency, and coalition partners, analytics, when combined with production from the Defense Intelligence Enterprise, enables more complete threat awareness and understanding by deploying and deployed US forces to support their planning and targeting. This core function also informs research and development and threat-based rapid prototyping investment decisions, guides international and interagency coordination to enable counter threat-network support, and supplements U.S. Joint Force pre-deployment training to ensure the most recent threat is understood and new counter improvised threat systems can be properly utilized.

Enable DoD Responses to Improvised Weapons (JR). DTRA builds counter-IED and improvised threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners. Through a robust communities of action approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop counter IED and improvised threat solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed U.S. Joint Forces. This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire U.S. Government and its partners to garner support for counter IED and improvised threat development and delivery.

Enable Rapid Capability Delivery (JC). Understanding the threat drives a DTRA deliberate, structured, and proactive approach to identify and validate urgent or emergent capability gaps and requirements. DTRA's continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces enables early identification and understanding of C-IED and C-IT gaps, vulnerabilities, and risks and the timely validation, resourcing, development, and delivery of C-IED and C-IT material and non-material solutions. DTRA technical integrators embedded with deployed forces further enables rapid adjustments to solutions as the threat’s adaptation evolves.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables DTRA to understand and analyze global threat information. It is an Information Technology (IT) Operations  quick-reaction capability supported by the rapid collection, fusion, and dissemination of operational-intelligence, and technology in order to enable the defeat of threat networks that employ disruptive technologies.

The JIDO advanced Mission Information Technology (MIT) capability, its software Systems Integration Lab (SIL), and embedded CCMD-direct support and reachback staff, continuously create capabilities to ingest, fuse, analyze, and present mission relevant data and information that provides immediate assistance to DoD and the whole of government. This capability, called Catapult, is a fully accredited SIPR and JWICS based analytical cloud architecture.  The Catapult architecture pulls from over more than 850 SIPR and more than 170 JWICS data sources and allows for simple and open data access, system stability, scalability, and advanced analytics.  In addition to Catapult, the MIT created another significant capability called Voltron.  Voltron provides analysts access to SIGINT data within a secure and IC-accredited software developer environment. Voltron, give analysts access to continuously new models in support of “Attack the Network” analysis and operations.  Voltron provides analysts access to methodologies involving multi-INT fusion in an easy to use interface. These methods are based on years of experience supporting tactical targeting environment and built in collaboration with other teams across the Intelligence Community.  There are currently more than 75 models in Voltron available to the user community.

DTRA's authorities and mission have enabled a unique “Path-to-Production” (PTP) for mission-driven IT solutions.  This unique development environment includes an integrated Cyber Security Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) process, an in-house collateral Authorizing Official (AO), a strong partnership between technologists and intelligence analysts working real-world problems, and a collaborative and innovative culture that launches practical software solutions rapidly.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This will include the Common Intelligence Picture/Common Operational Picture and technical data and will serve as the platform for creation of C-IED/C-sUAS analytics.
- Build a data science enabled module that will crawl through Catapult reporting and identify reports related to IED/sUAS events. Through machine learning techniques and application of training data, the team will train this module to identify reports that normal queries may miss. These reports will serve as the base data set for the C-IED/C-sUAS event table.
- Prepare a list of vetted IED/sUAS events pulled from Catapult reporting.  Events will be broken down into relevant categories with associated attributes.
- Stand up a database of technical data associated with known IED/sUAS. Library will be available for direct query and incorporated into other C-IED/C-sUAS capabilities.
- Integrate Virtual Management System processes and capabilities to build 3D models for various maritime vessels requested by external SOF customer.
- Develop and test a software mapping tool and spatial data analytics technology web service capable of a providing user functionality to create basic geospatial analytic outputs (i.e., line of sight, route vulnerability, etc.).
- Generate additional Data Science tables populated with entities extracted from Catapult using RipIt regex trees.   This will provide a “truth set” for future Natural Language Processing.
- Develop and Test new tools allowing for the visualizing (and effects) of underwater explosions.
- Develop a new application (Thor) as a “rules-based” approach to existing Avengers/Phoenix models. Thor is planned to enhance sensitive site exploitation (SSE) data with a tool will provide comprehensive approach to SSE vetting.
- Develop capability to visualize and derive trends for Air and Marine Operations Center non-commercial flight data.
- Develop and test an Interactive interface which will provide access to the Avenger tool suite on selective networks.
- Scope and Design the Data Science software and tool development environment as to create containerized tools which will provide a standard working image across the multiple networks.
- Provide a methodology to leveraging contextual clues from reporting, provide additional information about individual person entities extracted from reports. (i.e., job title).
- Develop and Test custom webpages that will provide “pre-vetted” data against analyst problem set. Automated workflow built for specific customer needs. 
- Develop and test a web-based Horizon version to act as a location intelligence discovery tool. The tool will provide geospatial querying within 2D maps to users as a light weight alternative to the smart-client version.
- Develop and test a web-based C2IS2 tool that will provide OP/INTEL users with the capability to capture and manage the processes, observables, and signatures associated with IED operations and use that data for training, analysis, collection planning, and exploitation.
- Continued improvements to the JIDO DevOps Pipeline and maturing the approach to delivery using containers
- Deploy a subset of the Attack the Network Tool Suite (ANTS) application on Non-Classified Local Area Network and an easy navigation directory.
- Provide Integration and Test activities against a Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES) instance of Catapult. Upgrade and test all applications to work with Metrics across the ANTS Suite, upgrade the user account and authentication in relation to the F5/Certificate Authentication System, and deploy Horizon Web.
- Conduct System Integration of Catapult and all ANTS applications on the new HP Moonshot hardware.
- Support proper deployment procedures and provide a test environment for the newly deployed Catapult and ANTS related applications on HP Moonshot hardware.
- Test all Catapult and all ANTS applications at a COOP location.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enhances U.S. Joint Forces’ responsiveness to improvised weapons. DTRA builds counter-threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners. Through a robust communities of action approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop C-IED and C-IT solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed U.S. Joint Forces. This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire U.S. Government and its partners as counter-improvised threat solutions are developed and realized. 

DTRA responds to the following improvised threats: Home-Made Explosives (HME), Vehicle-Borne IED (VBIED), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Vehicle-Attached IED (VAIED), Anti-Armor IED (AIED) Buried IED, Radio Controlled IED (RCIED), Person-Borne IED (PBIED), Booby Trapped Structures (BTS), Improvised WMD, Water-Borne IED (WBIED), Tunnels, and emerging threats that are identified by the warfighter deployed forward.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project harnesses an in-depth understanding of the threat leading to identification and validation of urgent or emergent counter-threat requirements and Combatant Command capability gaps. In turn, DTRA-JIDO rapidly provides Counter - Improvised Explosive Device/ Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED/C-sUAS) and C-IT solutions to prevent or mitigate battlefield operational surprise. DTRA’s continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces and coordination with Military Service components enables full transparency of investment activities and provides for the early identification and understanding of C-IED and C-IT risks and vulnerabilities which enable the timely validation, development, and delivery of counter-threat material and non-material solutions.

DTRA delivers counter-threat materiel solutions in support of US Joint Forces supporting contingency operations, effectively addressing changes to threat Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TT&amp;P) affecting deployed forces.  Capability incorporates an embedded tactical presence to understand a continuously evolving threat environment and complete visibility of the current DoD counter-threat portfolio to enable rapid response to warfighter vulnerabilities and to enhance force protection and maneuverability.  DTRA responds to the following improvised threats: Home-Made Explosives (HME), Vehicle-Borne IED (VBIED), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Vehicle-Attached IED (VAIED), Anti-Armor IED (AIED) Buried IED, Radio Controlled IED (RCIED), Person-Borne IED (PBIED), Booby Trapped Structures (BTS), Improvised WMD, Water-Borne IED (WBIED), Tunnels, and emerging threats that are identified by the warfighter deployed forward.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Develop counter measures for RCIED’s based on the evolving global network environments (4G, LTE and 5G). 
- Identify alternative methods to Common Timing Protocol (CTP) for current and future Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) capabilities. 
- Develop remote neutralization of HME and pre-cursors: through the use of chemical neutralization, dilution solutions, and dispersants while controlling the thermal degradation to target HME manufacturing without putting the warfighter in harm’s way.
- Improve / develop threat Improvised Explosive Device/small Unmanned Aerial Systems (IED/sUAS) detect and defeat capabilities against future technology:  acoustic detection at range, machine learning of constantly changing threat signatures (acoustic, RF signal, radar cross-section, optics, Unattended Radiated Emissions (URE), etc.)
- Develop anti-armor detection and defeat capabilities: Real-time reporting from sensors on mounted vehicles that can detect road-side threats in high clutter, while operating at speed, with high Positive Detection and acceptable False Alarm Rate. 
- Develop real-time data processing of signal in subterranean environment to improve friendly operations in a tunnel.  
- Improve in-tunnel ISR and communications.  
- Develop explosive formulations and rapid remediation techniques for improvised threats in support of improvised threats in tunnels.  
- Test and develop airborne detection using thermal changes in earth or condensation anomalies presented by voids for detection of tunnels. 
- Improve smaller laser to support pre-detonation capabilities
- Improve size, weight and power for next generation of pre-detonation systems
- Improve mounted detection of buried IEDs through real-time reporting from sensors on mounted vehicles that can detect buried threats at depths while conducting maneuver ops at speed with high Positive Detection and acceptable False Alarm Rate.  Hardware improvements enable faster sensing and software improvements enable faster systems-of-systems reporting (higher Positive Detection and lower False Alarm Rate).</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The goal of the NACT RDT&amp;E program is to enable full compliance of all emerging data availability/data quality requirements and other operational requirements as documented in nuclear CTBT treaty requirements, nuclear-event response requirements, language, CTBT-issued Radionuclide and Waveform Operations Manuals, other CTBT Organization communications, and DoD Treaty Implementation Manager directives.  The IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event.  RDT&amp;E is conducted in support of the NACT’s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.  CTBT IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$0.022 in FY 2019 is due a reduction to Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (LogCOP) support to the logisticians as they plan, execute, control, and assess in an increasingly complex global environment. Additionally, the decrease reduces the overall pace and scope of GCSS development efforts to meet Joint Staff logistics operational needs and transition to the C2 framework.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System – Joint (GCSS-J) provides the warfighter with a single, end-to-end capability to manage and monitor personnel and equipment through the mobilization process. GCSS-J, the Logistics' System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (JLogCOP), ensuring the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place, at the right time, and in the right quantities across the full spectrum of military operations. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide fused, integrated, near real-time multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., Supply, Deployment and Distribution, Engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports.  GCSS-J provides real-time in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The JS J-4, in collaboration with the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) approved the transition of GCSS-J to a SharePoint-based Logistics Common Operational Picture.  The PMO will introduce SharePoint server within the GCSS-J enclave to provide an Enterprise SharePoint Solution which integrates the automated data services and visualizations provided by GCSS-J and supports site specific user defined operational pictures (UDOP).  This will promote standardization across CCMDs and allow CCMDs to use their primary SharePoint portal or alternative work space to visualize and share data with other CCMDs. Additionally, the functional sponsor approved the development of widgets to support the Operational Contract Support (OCS) community allowing visibility of contractor management, awarded procurements, and emerging requirements.</r2:Text>

The decrease of -$5.024 from 2017 to FY 2018 reduces Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture (LogCOP) support to the logisticians as they plan, execute, control, and assess in an increasingly complex global environment.  Additionally, the decrease reduces the overall pace and scope of GCSS development efforts to meet Joint Staff logistics operational needs. Part of the overall decrease (-$0.274) is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO) uses various contract types, employs large and small contractors, and is focused on achieving agency socio-economic goals and incorporating DoD acquisition reform initiatives in purchasing. The PMO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements. By stating the requirements in a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements Document as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4. These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.

Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J PMO. The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are of benefiting the user. Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed. These tools become increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications, which allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services. As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics will ensure that the system is meeting user requirements.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during one of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States (US) forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North America Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  

A planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities; enabling network operation centers to priority command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, “non-mil” platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among United States (US) forces and multinational partners.

1) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations at the Secret Releasable level.  There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  

2) Pegasus connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the US, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. 

3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.

4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS) extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners, enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DISA's NMCS engineering program meets the NMCS systems engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.
The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS engineering focuses on implementing collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, integrating adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transitioning nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol based networks, migrating data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementing modern cryptological devices, and utilizing wireless networking to support warning systems and situational awareness.

Integrate applicable portions of the NMCS into the National Leadership Commmand Capability (NLCC) portfolio.

The increase of +$1.288 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to application of the NLCC Configuration Management process to applicable NMCS systems and to provide engineering support for Northstar and SATSTAR services transition to new NLCC transport infrastructure. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.079 attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The JSEIO conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks. Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.

The NMCS met all FY 2017 performance metrics and is on track to meet its FY 2018 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within
allocated resources 100% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Infrastructure Engineering and Integration effort encompasses two projects: Modeling and Simulation and DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support. There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).

The DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. 

The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.

The DoDIN Systems Engineering and Support project performs discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technologies through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to fill capability shortfalls and technology gaps across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).   The OCTO identifies these gaps/shortfalls, pursues leading innovative solutions from industry, academia, and the Federal sector, and engages industry partners for commercial best practices.  The OCTO Develops technology forecasts and innovation roadmaps for existing and nascent DISA Programs in the following areas:  Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DoDIN/Mobile/End-User Devices).   The OCTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services.  The OCTO performs early identification of technology needs and explores, develops, and delivers recommended emerging technologies to the DISA Requirements &amp; Analysis Office.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The increase of +$0.386 in FY 2017 is attributed to increased efforts in the modeling and simulation support for the architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions. 

The decrease of -$5.448 in FY 2019 is due to the completion of reviews on future innovation and emerging technologies within DoD requirements. This realigns resources from RDT&amp;E to O&amp;M to focus from development of Mission and Business Case Analysis, to include ROI analysis, as required for senior decision makers in strategic assessments, analysis of alternatives, and mission partner support.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and end-to-end (E2E) analytical functions for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Modeling and Simulation activities support the Department of Defense (DoD) communications planning and investment strategy, including: application performance assessments, contingency planning, network capacity planning and diagnostics, and systems-level modeling and simulation. Project efforts provide across-theater information awareness for Combatant Commands through application solutions for integrated networks, including DoD’s missions in Afghanistan and the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) by: (1) supporting the development and implementation of DoD Information Network (DODIN) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) processes essential to evolving the DODIN in a manner that enables interoperability and E2E performance for critical DODIN programs; (2) developing standardized DISA systems analyses and integration processes to improve systems integration across DISA for all DISA developed communication systems and services; and (3) providing the underlying modeling and simulation and analytical support for E2E DISA and DoD systems engineering and assessment. 

Project efforts provide DoD decision makers with services and a suite of tools capable of identifying key points of impact on DoD command and control information systems and recommending trade-offs within the DODIN configuration with regard to prioritized performance, availability, and security. This effort will reduce the risk in products deployed to the warfighter through improved network performance and traffic analysis, and an efficient means of troubleshooting and subsequent redesign.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EWSE uses contractors to assist/supplement the Government lead/team for technical activities. Subject matter experts in both large and small businesses are sought for the engineering support. Firm fixed price contracts with one option year are typically used in open competition. Furthermore, technical work with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) such as MITRE and MIT Lincoln Lab are established and coordinated when the Government can leverage their expertise and R&amp;D in the key technology.  

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). FFRDCs are also considered depending upon the task.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support project aligns with the updated DISA Strategic Plan, which includes the Chief Technology Officer’s Outlook and a Technology Watchlist. The Watchlist identifies key technology areas that are essential for Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) including:  Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, and Communication (DoDIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   
The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support Project ensure the technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and the latest Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO) Capabilities Planning Guidance (CPG) through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These strategies will establish the foundation for DISA's technology investments and technical development. The OCTO leverages emerging technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings to the DoD, the Warfighter, and other Federal Agencies, and provides actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.
Cyber security and cloud computing present critical near term challenges, especially the ability to securely leverage commercial cloud service offerings. The OCTO’s partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions. Included are applications with a security wrapper that detect and mitigate cyberattacks; smart routing and managed reputation capability; embedded system defense capabilities; and resilient and intrusion-tolerant network capabilities.
Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services. The OCTO will conduct technology assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DODIN architecture and standards. Enabled by the Technology Assessment Framework (TAF) and the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR), the OCTO will perform “quick looks” and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies. These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities; physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service APIs and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services; analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products; advanced approaches to Continuity of Operations (COOP) in a hybrid cloud environment; and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler to leverage capabilities from five principal areas. These five areas are; Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DoDIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   CTO will conduct technical assessments for future cloud computing technologies and innovative service delivery models, mobile devices, application development and vetting best practices, and next generation virtualized Software Defined Networks (SDN) for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.   CTO will partner with commercial partners, academia, technical analysis centers, as well as organizations within the Intelligence Community, to bring state of the art capabilities to the DISA/DoD resulting in better communications and monitoring tools, enterprise services and improved end-user services and capabilities.  CTO will continue to pursue and refine methods, processes and strategies to assist in the acceleration of capability into the operational environment.                  

There is a increase of +$1.771 from FY 2017 to FY 2018.  Funding will be used to morph to an internet 2.0 environment where DoD, other government organizations, coalition members, first responders, private industry, academia and commercial vendors will be able to share secured data and information in such a way that adversaries can be identified, found, brought to Justice before inflicting harm on innocent citizens and allies anywhere in the world.  CTO will aggressively pursue next generation technologies to feed the internet 2.0 environment.  These technologies will be leveraged through the expansion of a CTO futuristic Skunk Works effort known as Software Defined Everything (SDE) which is based on the notion of using software to keep redefining itself, rather than being locked into operating in a specific way.  It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler for the internet 2.0 environment. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.276 is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Number of Technology Assessments 

Performance is measured by the number of technologies assessed and the technologies transitioned or presented to DISA decision-making bodies such as the Service Portfolio Council (SPC) for acquisition decisions.  The assessments identify, promote, channel and align technology research and investments.  The objectives are to satisfy warfighter requirements by addressing capability gaps, to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, and to reduce the time needed to field emerging technologies.   

Measure/Goal:   Number of technology assessments instantiated within the CTO Technology Environment.  Number of research initiatives designed, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned or presented to DISA decision-making bodies such as the SPC for acquisition decisions.

FY 2017 Target:   8 Assessed and 5 transitioned / Actual: 8 Assessed and 5 transitioned
FY 2018 Target:   12 Assessed and 8 transitioned 
FY 2019 Target:   12 Assessed and 8 transitioned</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Networking capabilities and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.

PNVC:  The PVNC provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military, satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The PNVC system provides a military satellite-based, world-wide, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders.  By implementing new technology capabilities (e.g. Ethernet-Framing and higher data rate), this project provides improved performance to the survivable voice conferencing capability.  This project supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including engineering required to develop new vocoder, cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The decrease of -$25.050 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is primarily attributed to the one time increase in FY 2016 to complete the airborne variants of the PNVC baseband equipment. The original environmental requirements for the PNVC baseband equipment were changed in FY14 and the original designs were deemed suitable only for ground locations. This necessitated the creation of airborne variants of the baseband equipment to meet the more stringent aircraft requirements of the E-4B and E-6B platforms. The funding for the Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to develop the airborne versions came in two increments: an FY15 reprogramming and in FY16 to complete the development.</r2:Text>

These documents include:  Project Execution Plan, Concept of Operations Acquisition Strategy, Capability Production Document, System Engineering Plan and other documents required by the DISA’s Component Acquisition Executive.  Additionally, for management and system engineering support vendors, monthly reports are critical to tracking overall programmatic and engineering progress and the percent of total deliverables received on time.

For product development activities, effective progress is measured based upon the task order milestones in the form of development reviews and weekly progress meetings.  As end items (hardware and software) become available for test, additional measures will be available.  Specifically, the percentage of successfully verified requirements out of the number tested and the number of critical trouble reports outstanding longer than six months, will be tracked.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DISN Systems Engineering Support project encompasses four activities:

Next Generation Networking Technologies (formally known as Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical Transport Technology Refresh):  Provides engineering technical expertise to support and integrate newer, more efficient technologies required to replace end of lifecycle equipment and to achieve more efficient Networking technologies.  These new technologies provide protected and assured services for critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.

Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).

Peripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  

DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Engineer with plans and procedures, systems analysis, operational assessments, systems engineering, and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the mission of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Systems Engineer to the Joint Staff and Executive Leadership. It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provide the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The decrease of  -$1.566 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is a result of decreased end-to-end user assessments for Senior Leader communications and mission effectiveness and a reduction in engineering activities supporting the transition of NLCC future capabilities to full operational capability.</r2:Text>

The decrease of +$1.942 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to reduced number of technical assessments required, expansion of the production of architectural artifacts required to complete the NLCC Technical Architecture; development of a NLCC Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability; support engineering and implementation of the NLCC enterprise mobility infrastructure. Part of the overall increase (-$0.297) is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by compliance with contract deliverables schedules for specifically included products, such as: operational assessment plans, operational assessment reports; recommended revisions to the Joint Staff’s Emergency Action Procedures (EAP-CJCS) Volumes VI and VII; updates to NC3 System Description documents and Nuclear C3 Architecture Diagrams. In addition, performance of the NC3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element. These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management. Performance of the SLC3S-Airborne fleet is measured by the technical assessment results documented in the assessment reports. Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff and the DoD CIO to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.

Specific performance metrics include the following:

Provide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.			
			
Conduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.			
			
MEECN achieved all its FY 2017 performance metrics and is on track to achieve the FY 2018 and FY 2019 targets of provisioning the Joint Staff requirements within the allocated resources 90% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment. One of the key capabilities residing within the JPES portfolio of sustaining the existing Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) while modernization of JOPES is planned and implemented.  The JPES portfolio also includes a core set of infrastructure services consisting of  the JPES Framework (JFW) and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection (JFP), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) and eventually the capabilities that will replace JOPES.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  Each year, the DISA architecture team, annually, produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities, anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the JC2 community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

All development, integration, and migration efforts within the portfolio are primarily supported through Cost Reimbursable Task Orders issued under competitively awarded contracts.  Acquisition Strategies are structured to retain contractors capable of satisfying cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Contract awards incorporate provisions requiring contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data.  This strategy mitigates risk by requiring monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs) and utilizing award fee contracts where appropriate to incentivize performance.  Both GCCS-J and JPES apply formal acquisition rigor to include reporting requirements, as appropriate, by acquisition program designation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) provides a full array of electromagnetic spectrum services and capabilities, ranging from short notice on-the-ground operational support at the forward edge, to long range planning in pursuit of national strategic objectives. These services/capabilities are in direct support of Combatant Commanders, the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer, Military Services, and Defense Agencies. The DSO is the focal point for electromagnetic spectrum analysis and the development of integrated spectrum plans and strategies to address current and future needs for DoD spectrum access. In addition, DSO serves as DoD's spectrum advocate at national and international forums and conducts extensive outreach to both industry and government. DSO also implements enterprise spectrum management capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency and agility to improve spectrum-dependent capabilities in support of United States and Coalition operations. This includes acquiring, implementing and sustaining the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) which provides an integrated catalog of joint net-centric spectrum management tools and services. Electromagnetic Spectrum Management enables information dominance through effective spectrum operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment (EME). Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.
 
Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

GEMSIS' acquisition approach is to obtain capabilities by adopting existing capabilities, buying commercial products, or developing new capabilities by delivering incrementally within the context of a streamlined and adaptive acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>1. Provide engineering support to DoD Components to ensure E3 and spectrum supportability requirements are addressed during the acquisition life-cycle meeting at least 90% of program suspenses. 
2. Execute effective emerging spectrum technologies evaluation process that generates timely and relevant products evaluating at least 3 technologies per quarter.
3. Provide technical E3 and spectrum engineering support upon request from the Combatant Commands, their components and the Military Services with a minimum 98% response rate.  
4. Develop an operational Joint spectrum management system that delivers at least 90% of products on schedule in accordance with objective scheduled events and deliverables as approved in the Acquisition Program Baseline- Schedule Status of systems.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Information Environment (JIE) construct is a consolidated secure and defensible environment across DoD.  This is comprised of unified, consolidated and shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and standardized security architectures throughout the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.  

The target objective state of JIE is a DODIN that optimizes the use of DoD's IT assets from the administrative and operational planning at the Pentagon to the tactical edge; to include our mission partners through converging communications, computing, enterprise services, and defense of the DODIN that can be leveraged for all Department missions. 

When implemented, JIE will reduce DoD's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improved security by reducing the attack surface of our networks, and enable Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies (CC/S/A) to more efficiently access information to perform their missions from any authorized IT device, any time, from anywhere in the world.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint DoD security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world. Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The savings are realized by coupling the JRSS and JMS. The JRSS collapses replicated IT security functionality for all Department of Defense (DoD) components into relatively few regionally located stacks.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.

The decrease of -$25.000 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the completion of initial advanced development capabilities and the planned transition to sustainment of initial capabilities delivered in FY 2017.  Advanced development capabilities prototyped in FY 2017 included (not limited to): Case Management, Imaging, Workflow Management, Virtual System Access, Automated Records Check, and E-Application. These advanced capabilities will reduce overall program and technical risk with respect to delivery of the new National Background Investigation System.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible. The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2018.

Generation 1/2 Metric:

Percentage of system changes resulting in interoperability certification

Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual, operationally-relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The T&amp;E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time.

The T&amp;E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity. In FY 2016, T&amp;E FT performed twelve (12) DCGS Enterprise assessments.  This trend is expected to continue in FY2017. Of the six DCGS PoR systems, two hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, &amp; Computers/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases. One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending. Of the three remaining PoRs, two are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&amp;E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events. Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&amp;E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.

In FY 2017, T&amp;E FT performed a minimum of ten (10) DCGS Enterprise assessments.

In FY 2018,  T&amp;E FT will perform a minimum of nine (9) DCGS Enterprise assessments.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible. The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2018.

Generation 1/2 Metric:

Percentage of system changes resulting in interoperability certification

FY 2018 Target: 100%

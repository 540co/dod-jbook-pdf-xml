                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this project is development of necessary simulation facilities and approaches to allow determination of the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare (EW) in real world engagement situations and to support the introduction of modern, effective systems into Naval Aviation. The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. 

The Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E).

This project directly supports the T&amp;E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: :  ALR-67(v)3 Radar Warning Receiver, ALQ-214 Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite,  AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System, AVR-2 Laser Warning System, ALQ-144A Infrared Countermeasure System, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700 Low Band Transmitter, P-8A and the Next Generation Jammer.

This project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&amp;E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The requirement is based on Department of Defense direction to improve the Electronic Warfare test infrastructure at the NAWC WD.  The investment supports procurement of threat emulators that are representative of capabilities possessed by near peer adversaries. These threat emulators will support evaluation of the electronic warfare capabilities of the Joint Strike Fighter Block IV.  Additional programs that will benefit from this capability include the Next Generation Jammer which begins Initial Operational Test and Evaluation in 2021, EA-18G and Triton.  The systems planned for procurement will provide the necessary frequency diversity, density and geographic dispersion to present a stressing, operationally realistic, threat environment to evaluate the performance of the JSF Block IV, Next Generation Jammer, the EA-18G and Triton, as well as other electronic warfare, electronic attack and electronic protection systems.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (ENEWS) Project is the development and application of necessary simulation assets to determine the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare for Navy ships in simulated real-world engagement situations.  The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Force, Special Operations, and other Electronic Warfare Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for Electronic Warfare system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems modeling tool that was developed to support Testing and Evaluation.  Simulation Display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) Testing and Evaluation and training ranges to provide visualization of Testing and Evaluation and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is unique in that it is the only project within the Department of Defense dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard Electronic Warfare systems and tactics against these type threats.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  Development Test, Operational Test and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation support includes AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship InfraRed signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and Patrol Craft class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including Test and Evaluation of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' Electronic Warfare systems in joint allied exercises. Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets also support Joint Electronic Warfare exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Aerial Target Systems Development program is the design and development of threat representative subsonic and supersonic aerial targets that simulate threat weapon systems, threat aircraft or threat Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets and auxiliary payloads are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment.  As to specific hardware development, this project includes:

 - Supersonic Targets: GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) and GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) program.  Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats.  The design and development of GQM-163A capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and, to a lesser degree, support fleet training.  Critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events are supported for AEGIS, DDG-1000, LHA-6, CVN-78, LCS, and LSD-41/49 (SM-6, SM-2, RAM, SSDS, and ESSM).  GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 13.0 to 66 ft.  The GQM-163A has also demonstrated a capability to perform a higher altitude diving threat profile.  MSST was a supersonic development effort that was terminated on September 25, 2015.  Once the contract termination costs have been determined by DCMA, funds may be required to cover settlement costs. New supersonic target developments efforts include a Rapid Prototype alternative ground launched target and a replacement target for AQM-37.  

 - Subsonic Targets: The BQM-177A SSAT development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-74E targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities.  The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational test &amp; evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events.  Specifically, the BQM-177A SSAT provides critical live-fire test and evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.  

 - Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), and Target Control and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TC/TA/AS) development: The TTSP provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial targets to provide threat representative radio frequency signatures, specifically the electronic attack and threat radar emissions (active emitters). Development of threat representative simulation components is on-going and required to keep pace with evolving threats and ensure that the Navy's threat simulation capabilities maintain warfighter readiness in the current environment. TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various TMSS including but not limited to: scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification, friend or foe, and associated test sets.  TA/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide high fidelity simulation of foreign threats.  TA/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems.

In addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development.  For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue to support design, development and qualification of TMSS including but not limited to the current and next generation TC systems, scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification friend or foe and associated test sets.  Augmentation and auxiliary systems must be capable of augmenting targets in support of radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement/test, radar cross section evaluation, decoy effectiveness, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare, warhead effectiveness and evaluation of fleet tactics, readiness, and training.  The TTSP provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial/surface targets to provide threat representative Radio Frequency signatures, specifically the Electronic Attack and Threat Radar Emissions (Active Emitters).  The TTSP accomplishes this by providing a collection of modules which are integrated into individual targets in various configurations to provide the ability to simulate the RF environment.  TTSP equipment in various configurations is certified for carriage in aerial/surface targets.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Supersonics: The GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) is an Acquisition Category II program. Development strategy includes the continued development of the Quad Launch capability. The SSST program development efforts also include the development and design efforts for a new Radome and Radar Altimeter and other Engineering Change Proposals as required to emulate emerging threat systems. These development efforts will continue to be rolled into the production baseline. Production efforts are expected to continue at higher quantities in order to meet projected MDAP T&amp;E requirements. Additionally, development of alternative supersonic targets is being explored.  

Congress was notified on September 25, 2015 that the Department of the Navy made the decision to terminate the Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) development program. Termination settlement efforts are ongoing with DCMA.

Subsonics: The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) program is an Acquisition Category IVM program. The EMD contract was awarded to an OEM that proposed a BQM-177A as the vehicle to satisfy the identified requirements for a new SSAT.  It is currently undergoing developmental testing with Critical Design Review, Test Readiness Review / Flight Readiness Review completed in FY16 and Milestone C completed in 1st Quarter FY17. The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 option contract was awarded 28 June 2017 and the second pre-negotiated option, LRIP 2, is scheduled to award in 2nd Quarter FY18. IOC is scheduled for 4th Quarter FY18 and the program will transition to Full Rate Production (FRP) in FY19. 

Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control, and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems: TTSP will continue to award contracts to support the development of electronic attack &amp; threat radar simulations, ensuring the fleet requirement for simulations of emerging threats is met. Additional contracts will be awarded to support the development and design of TMSS upgrades, including but not limited to the current and next generation Target Control Systems, Scalar Scorers, Scoring Ground Station, Telemetry Antennas, Radar and Locator Beacons, Identification Friend or Foe and associated test sets.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The funding increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 supports material procurements for the replacement of in-water sensors at AUTEC, additional equipment purchases for the Range Support aircraft, and the purchase of Radio Frequency (RF) signal generation and distribution equipment.

Funding increase from FY18 to FY19 supports the development of a common Navy modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) environment that is persistent across multiple domains.  Current M&amp;S capabilities are not easily integratable or interoperable.  An integrated multi domain M&amp;S environment will provide a reusable and persistent ability to perform analysis, engineering, and testing in mixed modeling lab and range environments.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the Operational Level of War (OLW) by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW). MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the Operational Level of War (OLW) by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW). MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval warfighting requirements.  This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on Portfolio Management Decision Support System by capturing and mapping issues/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project provides an essential management tool to: (a) assess the effectiveness of existing M&amp;P policies and programs; (b) identify needs for new policies and programs; (c) determine the required manpower and training mix relative to changing demographic, societal and legislative/regulatory actions, and to evolving strategic and geopolitical factors; (d) study the impact of M&amp;P programs on Navy accession, attrition, retention, and performance; and, (e) to develop, validate and/or refine a broad range of M&amp;P forecasting models. The program permits Navy to more effectively utilize Research and Development expertise to respond to emergent M&amp;P issues on a continuing basis.  This program is funded under RDT&amp;E operational systems development because it encompasses engineering and development of new end-items prior to production approval decision.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE provides funding to support continuing need for studies and analysis of issues critical to decisions required by the Chief of Naval Personnel and his staff regarding manpower, personnel, training and education policies, and programs that have far-reaching implications to service members and the Navy budget.  This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower &amp; Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Naval aviation pre-Milestone B developmental activities to include the conduct and integration of systems engineering activities. This project unit provides information, automated tools, and decision aids necessary to perform acquisition planning in support of warfighter capability requirements. This project unit also supports research, development, and analysis efforts to include various studies, joint requirements analysis, and cost analysis requirements in support of systems engineering activities, analyses of alternatives, and development of the 30-Year Aviation Plan, a Congressionally mandated product. Due to high turnover and end of service life of several Naval aircraft set against increasing threat capabilities, DOD 5000 series mandates documentation of capability requirements and mechanisms to obtain these capabilities. This project unit allows Naval aviation the means to properly identify capability gaps and potential solutions required to maintain maximum warfighting capability realizing (or achieving) reductions to technical risks and overall program costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) is the Department of the Navy's (DoN) only Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&amp;I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  

Other evaluation processes are as follows: 
A) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.

B) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&amp;I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>CNA is reviewed throughout the research year on several different levels to ensure that research produced is not duplicated elsewhere. The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. 
Other evaluation processes: 

A) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. 

B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO/N8 for final review and acceptance. 

C) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&amp;L).

D) Navy-CNA Integration Board.  DON 3-stars and CNA leadership meet quarterly to review the annual research program, discuss priorities and related implications for current and future work, and address issues impacting CNA's ability to execute its mission as an FFRDC.  CNA research highlights are also briefed and discussed.  The board meetings are chaired by the Director, Navy Staff.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR
describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no
government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3.2% for SBIR in FY 2017. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Phase I Feasibility: Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility: Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility: Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3.2% for SBIR in FY 2017. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in
federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3.2% for SBIR in FY 2017. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility: Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.
Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of
Record (POR). The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the
SBIR program. The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3.2% for SBIR in FY 2017. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $1,000,000,000 to set aside 0.45% for STTR in FY 2017. This funds cooperative R&amp;D between small businesses and research institutions. The program goals are to create vehicles
from moving ideas from research institutions to market; enable researchers to pursue commercial application of technologies; and bridge funding gap between basic research and commercial product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns.

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the small business concerns Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs. These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award
more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier DOD STTR program. Although no government STTR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's STTR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>International Cooperative RDT&amp;E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.

Naval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  

Assessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.

Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.

Operations Integration Group:  Classified

CHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&amp;M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.

The Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.

MTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:

This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations. Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009). Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States). This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.

The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations. This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats.

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1) Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2) Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3) Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4) Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5) Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6) Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7) Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navy Postgraduate School (NPS) research and analysis activities serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic, tactical and operational thought within the Navy communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, tactical imperatives, quantitative analyses, technical developments and assessments, and political-military assessments.  Also, provide recommendations to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Fleet Commanders and numbered Fleet Commanders regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options for the President of the United States.  Research will be conducted that will enhance graduate education for Naval Officers and potentially provide students with areas of studies for theses and faculty projects. These research activities also serve as a means for OPNAV Resource Sponsors and Major Commands to have analysis and decision support research conducted in the uses of the applied, soft, and hard sciences in solving diverse and complex resource allocation and strategic issues facing the Navy today and envisioned in the future.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect warfighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Warfare); warfare systems (Expeditionary Warfare &amp; Combat Logistics, Sea Control, and Power Projection) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both warfighting and warfighting-support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.

CONFORM/CDE for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Commands (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  
-	The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.
-	This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.
-	Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and interoperability gaps of both current and future Navy platforms and systems capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Studies will be performed in a continuous manner to support future recapitalization of Surface Combatants, Amphibious Ships, Carriers, Auxiliary Ships and other emerging program requirements.
-Collaborated with Warfare Systems design experts to perform continuous Warfare Systems analysis at the ship and fleet level.  Warfare Systems effectiveness assessment tools are being continually developed and enhanced as required to address future concepts and to incorporate improvements in information technology systems.  Additionally, collaborate with aircraft, C4ISR, and networks by continuing dialog and collaboration between NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and SPAWAR systems commands which refines fleet level requirements.
-Refined platform concept stage cost analysis tools to predict costs better in areas where weight-based algorithms may not be appropriate.  Continually enhance tools to estimate total ownership costs more accurately at the ship and weapons system concept development stage.  Continue to conduct cost estimates in support of future concept design exploration, CBA, and AoA efforts.  Further develop Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) to accommodate emerging technologies incorporated in future platforms.  Continue to develop cost estimating tools which incorporate emerging technologies applicable to future platforms.
-Conducted future force structure concept formulation.  Fleet synthesis and analysis will be conducted, which includes capabilities requirements, platform design and cost and quantitative tracking of the long-term evolution of the fleet as new platforms are introduced and old ones are retired.  Areas examined include interoperability concepts, force architecture impact studies, Long Range Shipbuilding Schedule (LRSS) support, and operational employment concept studies.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The overall goal is to conduct analysis to support the Navy decisions needed to turn strategy and guidance into the Fleet capabilities we need within acceptable risk. METRIC:  Risks are balanced across capability that delivers the right capabilities within the resources available to Navy.  Navy Assessment Program supports the development of platform specific studies and Capabilities Based Assessments, an analytical effort resulting in Functional Area Analysis, Functional Needs Analysis, and Functional Solution Analysis.  Efforts provide added analytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and support warfare integration initiatives. 

-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics, capabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material. METRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling/methodology to support analysis. Models/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints. 

-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not limited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of large-scale architecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine ability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category Program Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research performance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned systems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations and uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results. 

-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy that work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21 to include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.

-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or support capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in warfighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems and technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program planning to determine the warfighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities. Determine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy. 

-World Class Modeling, Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements process that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support analyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation plans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.
The May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a CBA to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations.  Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009, 2015, and 2016).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) Forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of eleven participating nations (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in multiple Projects and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.  The MTMD Forum is leveraging At-Sea Demonstration (ASD) test events and operational Fleet Exercises  to integrate technology with concepts of operations developed within MTMD Forum working groups.

The MTMD Forum develops systems and techniques that enhance protection and defense against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.

Starting in FY17, funding for MTMD is realigned from Program Element 0603582N Combat System Integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

(1) BMC4I continued engineering analysis and multi-national interoperability gap assessment for the Target Architecture based on test results and began development of the Target Architecture based on requests for information input from member nations. BMC4I evaluated Recommended Point Solutions and provided recommendations for the implementation in correcting coalition interoperability gaps. BMC4I determined information exchange requirements in preparation for at-sea demonstrations. BMC4I continued updating MTMD Coalition Capabilities and Interoperability (CCI) and Systems Tactical Data Links Interoperability Report (STIR).

(2) M&amp;S completed the Technical Plan of Work for Project Arrangement 4 (PA 4). The Technical Plan of Work provides the basis for M&amp;S efforts supporting analysis of future Target Architectures and future capabilities developed by the MTMD Forum. The virtualization of the M&amp;S Test Bed in FY17 provided additional capability for M&amp;S to perform analysis for the Forum. In support of the Joint Project Optic Windmill (JPOW 17), the M&amp;S Working Group provided the following products: JPOW 17 Statement of Test Requirements, JPOW 17 Analysis Plan, JPOW 17 Concept Development and Experimentation Phase (CDE) positional analysis report, JPOW 17 Mission Model analysis and report, and JPOW 17 Table Top analysis report. 

(3) CDEP continued to maintain its alignment with the Systems Engineering Teams (SET) Capability Roadmap with the incorporation of national systems upgrades and improvements.  CDEP utilized BMC4I Coalition Capabilities and Interoperability (CCI) document in planning for the Annual Test Event.  Inputs were also received from the Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) and Operational Requirements (OR) working groups to assess test objectives for land-based testing.  CDEP accomplished its first Annual Test Event (ATE1) for Project Arrangement Three (PA3) in February 2017.  This event included objectives for the Joint Project Optic Windmill 2017 (JPOW17) and Formidable Shield 2017 (FS17). Data analysis is expected to be complete and reported end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.  

(4) Open Architecture completed the Open Architecture Radar Interface Standard (OARIS) Project Arrangement final report. Open Architecture continued to analyze, define and document the data model requirements as the first task in building the Force Level Open Architecture Technical Standard (FLOATS). The requirements are being used to develop, derive, and evaluate existing data models that will define the force level data model. The OAWG collaborated with BMC4I, OR, and the Special Experts Meeting (SEM) to ensure alignment with the Target and Reference Architecture as well as the Possible Point Solution (PPS) Force Level Functions (FLFs).

(5) TPEX continued preparations for MTMD participation as part of ongoing at-sea test event continuums and Formidable Shield 17.  TPEX initiated planning for Pacific Dragon 2018 exercise during the Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC).  The at-sea demonstrations included live-tracking events and a combination of live and simulated engagements. Integrated Air Defense and Ballistic Missile Defense test scenarios were conducted among the nations.

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Operational Emulation (OE). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on OE sub Line of Effort (LOE) with at least 80% of initial objectives being met after proof of concept test run in late FY17; successfully implement quarterly OE events beginning 1QTR FY18

OE provides funding to support continuing requirement for extensive studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). This PE directly supports the China Strategic Initiative (CSI) Strategic Emulations LOE, expanding those outputs to the operational level, making insights timely and relevant to USPACOM (and other Combatant Commands), Functional Component Force Commanders across all strategic domains (e.g. cyber, air and space, sea etc.) in support of national-level mandated operational and strategic-level contingency planning.  

Operational Decision Analysis (ODA). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on ODA sub Line of Effort support effort with at least 80% of initial objectives being achieved by 3QTR FY18.

ODA provides funding to support continuing requirement for studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). The PE directly support CSIs Strategic Emulation LOE and will provide critical technical inputs and strategic insights that complement the programs OE output database, which is still under development. ODA outputs will significantly enhance Combatant Component Command staffs with their operational and intelligence planning and global synchronization across multiple domains amongst all geographic and functional combatant commands.  

Decision Support Elements to Operational Emulation Modeling and Simulation (DSEOMS). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on this major LOE with at least 80% of initial objectives being met by 3QTR FY19.

DSEOMS provides funding to support all four major LOEs for the CSI program and all its sub-LOEs. This effort will provide a comprehensive and campaign-quality decision support toolset to decision makers across the entire CSI enterprise: OSD, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Intelligence Community, and the Whole of US Government (Interagency). This PE will create a set of enhanced automated and doctrinal decision- making tools to assist key policy- and strategic leaders on a full spectrum of contingencies related to competitor nations. DSEOMS will provide analytic modeling and simulation tools that take inputs from all major CSI program LOEs; the goal being to present decision- and policy-makers and their planning staffs with a rich dataset of information that is relevant, timely, and substantive for their respective problem sets. The current scope and focus across all LOEs is to support emerging near-term and longer-term planning to both significantly enhance war planning orientation and force posture considerations but also to significantly enhance more informed strategic choices regarding future joint/service capability investments and joint/service operational concepts across all strategic domains.   Ultimately, fully integrated program deliverables will guide a deliberative process for identifying efficiencies in major service platform decisions to ensure they are optimized for the full-spectrum of projected adversary capabilities in the future.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>In 2005, the National Academies national research council (NRC) conducted a study and subsequently issued a report relating to manufacturing trends in printed circuit technology.  Within that report, the NRC detailed four critical issue areas that needed to be addressed in the interest of national security.  Those issue areas included; Trust, Supply Chain, Organic (DoD) Capability Sustainment, and Technology Development.  

Intense global competition in the Printed Circuit Board (PrCB) industry has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of United States PrCB companies, leaving the domestic PrCB industrial base "fragile" and progressively declining in capability and health.  Implementation of the strategies developed by the EA for PrCB Technologies will proactively ensure that the U.S. PrCB industry is capable of supporting future DoD electronics requirements.  The strategic plan is expected to indentify technology gaps and research and development needs, as well as identify and recommend policy changes.

In addition to benefiting DoD by ensuring access to leading edge PrCB technology, it is expected that the EA program will help the struggling domestic PrCB industry by indentifying future technology research and development needs and securing the domestic military market.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

In addition, it provides research and reports necessary to support SURTASS LFA and Compact Low Frequency Active (CLFA) sonar compliance with Federal, State and Local environmental laws required for continued SURTASS LFA and CLFA operations, analysis of undersea technology for application to future undersea surveillance capabilities, and assessment of current and future IUSS warfare areas and potential allied Navy contributions. To this end, research is conducted by prominent educational and research institutions recognized for their expertise in the area, and by marine mammal biologists with extensive background in specific areas of underwater acoustics. This approach is deemed the most cost effective and efficient course of action for the Navy.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports ONR leadership, management and direction for the Naval S&amp;T program. This project funds ONR HQ Non-Management Headquarters Activities (Non-MHA) salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  In FY16 and out, the Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plan effort will be transferred into this project from PE 0605853N Project 3025 to support ONR's goal of attaining a clean and auditable financial statement. ONR sponsors scientific advances, which lead to Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs), supporting the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority. Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&amp;D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&amp;D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&amp;D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances. This project also supports ONR Non-MHA management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs:  Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program. 

Additionally, this project funds ONR field salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  Functions performed support ONR's Navy-wide responsibilities in the negotiation and establishment of indirect cost rates for DoD-assigned universities and performance of contract administration for all DoD contracts/grants at all colleges and universities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This project provides for Non-MHA costs of ONR Headquarters in support of the entire Navy S&amp;T program. Most all the funds in this project are fixed costs, such as salaries and communications. Specifically, it pays the salaries of Scientific and Engineering and corporate business personnel who direct the execution of the Navy's basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development programs at the nation's universities/colleges, Navy laboratories, Warfare Centers, and private industry.

This project also provides for Non-MHA costs of ONR's field activities to include fixed costs, such as salaries and communications.

The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects a transfer of Non-MHA funding to PE 0602861N Science &amp; Technology Management - ONR Field Accounts to consolidate ONR Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Management in Applied Research and improve reporting of Navy's S&amp;T investment by including S&amp;T management as part of the S&amp;T topline, offset by the transfer of funding from 0605853N Management, Technical and International Support to support Financial Auditability and Audit Readiness (FIAR).

Effective in FY18 this PE Project will only fund NGEN Corporate requirements and FIAR Civilian Salary (1 FTE).</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This continuing program provides support for ships and aircraft required to accommodate Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of new systems. The RDT&amp;E ship and aircraft inventory is required to adequately test new and improved weapon systems, stay current with threats, and increase warfighting capability of the fleet. The program provides integrated logistics support for aircraft at selected field activities; provides depot-level rework of aircraft, engines, and components for the Navy inventory of RDT&amp;E aircraft; and provides support for ships and aircraft bailed to contractors for Navy RDT&amp;E projects. Costs covered under this element include aircrew training and proficiency, fuel, supplies, equipment, repair, Aviation Depot Level Repairables, overhaul of ships and aircraft, as well as organizational, intermediate, and depot maintenance of ships and aircraft in the Navy RDT&amp;E inventory.


JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Aircraft Flight Hours.  This non-acquisition project supports direct flight hour costs, including organizational and intermediate level maintenance, as well as associated consumables, including petroleum, oil, and lubricants.  These flight hours are used for post-maintenance test flights, aircrew training, and the accomplishment of pilot proficiency requirements (approximately three hours per pilot per month), in support of Research and Development programs at four Naval Air Systems Command/Naval Surface Warfare Center/Office of Naval Research flight activities.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Aircraft Support. This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&amp;E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Aircraft Structure Periodic Adjustments (ASPA), Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, Aviation Climate Assessment Survey System (ACASS) and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&amp;E requirements.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T&amp;E Enterprise consolidates all Air Warfare (AW) Ship Self Defense (SSD) at-sea testing across multiple class ships, beginning with LHD 8, LSD 52, LHA 6, DDG 1000, CVN 78, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) versions 12 and 17. This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.

Enterprise Cost elements:
a) SDTS Acquisition includes the direct procurement costs of major Combat Systems (CS) elements which will be installed on the SDTS.

b) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.

c) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, DDG 1000, LCS 12, LCS 17 and CVN 78.

d) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, LCS 12, LCS 17 and CVN 78.

e) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).

f) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.

g) Maintenance of CS includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.

The T&amp;E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&amp;E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a detachment of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, the mission of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center is to provide the US Navy an underwater range facility for full-spectrum test and evaluation of Undersea Warfare systems and for Fleet training and readiness assessment.  The Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center  Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  

Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  

Major test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 /Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 30 undersea target Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.

Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier/marine area include fully equipped machine /fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides continuing maintenance and operational support for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Test and Evaluation capabilities.  These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and Test and Evaluation  aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its Test and Evaluation mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range, which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.  This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is a new start FY17 program which funds the overhauls and preventative maintenance of the 23 Major Range and Test Facility Base marine vessels located at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, Pacific Missile Range Facility, Honolulu, HI, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport, WA, Naval Air Warfare Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD, and Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center. These vessels are used to launch and recover torpedoes, acoustic systems, and other weapons, provide range surveillance and clearance, and can be configured as a target.  Overhauls are required to operate ships over 300 tons overseas in compliance with American Bureau of Shipping "Load Line" certification requirements.  Major preventative maintenance requiring shipyard support is also performed during these periods to mitigate risks of failures.

Funding in the amount of $2M was realigned on July 26, 2017, from FY17 Major Range and Test Facility Base Marine Vessels project (0605864N/3386) to Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division project (0605864N/0653) to cover cost associated with the FY17 locality pay increase that Congress approved for Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake inside the Navy budget cycle.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY18 to FY19 funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD.  DoD mandated an increase in Cyber Security testing due to an increase in cyber intrusions from adversaries. Cyber intrusions continue to challenge our weapon systems' ability to detect threats, react to threats and restore system functionality after a cyber-attack. Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating costs and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation. This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop "minimum, adequate" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As indicated in section A above, funding provides for core headquarters operations and support (O&amp;S) costs related to required operational testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) conducted in support of Navy acquisition programs. The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&amp;S costs for day to day operations of the staff/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&amp;E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&amp;S costs typical of military field commands/activities). Within this project, over 1/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&amp;E offices/activities, and miscellaneous other customers/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            
                              
Number of Tests Conducted - FY17 = 104; FY18 = 110; FY19 = 112
Number of Programs Supported - FY17 = 424; FY18 = 424; FY19 = 424</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Radio Frequency (RF) Management Program. This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. 

(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.  It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems.

(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.

(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.

(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program.  The program investigates Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental effects between shipboard transmitters/receivers and develops EM and spectrum techniques with Commercial off the shelf (COTS)  technologies to provide the ability to monitor EM spectrum usage and system EM degradation on all ships in a given strike group.  The program will investigate technologies to build an EM Spectrum Common Operational Picture (COP) to detect and assess operational capabilities in real-time.  Additional investigations will be performed to develop processes and procedures to predict the EM environment for planning purposes.  In the out-years, these capabilities will be used to build the next generation combat system with inherent spectrum agility and self-awareness capability, further enhancing the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>- Instrumentation will be developed to extract digital data and raw video from several different search radars enabling quantitate (instead of qualitative) assessment of performance degradation and electromagnetic interference.
- Instrumentation will be developed to perform non-invasive (i.e. off satellite) bit error rate test methods for SATCOM system.  This enables EMI quantification at the modem later, rather than spectral layer, to quantify impacts in terms of data rate and satellite resources.   
- Develop and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed EMI solutions and coordinate with system program managers for proper integration of the final EMI solution.
- EMI Problem Characterization and Quantification will be performed on approximately 60 specific EMI problems to identify level of problem severity and prioritize EMI mitigation efforts.
- The program will evaluate the Navy's Next Generation: Radars (i.e., Enterprise Air Search Radar, Air &amp; Missile Defense radar, Dual Band Radar, Next Gen Surface Search Radar, etc.), Electronic Warfare Systems (i.e., Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program and Ships Signal Exploitation Equipment Mods), Satellite Communication (i.e., the Navy Multi-Band Terminal and the Commercial Broadband Satellite Program), and Common Data Link Programs.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF). 

(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development. Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
  
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
  
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to: 1) Exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) Understand the disposition of friendly forces; 3) Target and conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) Assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council (MROC), has established Operations Analysis Directorate (OAD), as the sole operations research, analytic support, and studies management program for the Marine Corps Study System (MCSS). OAD provides Senior Military Leadership with a comprehensive understanding of operations and advanced analytic and statistical support. In compliance with Executive Order #13589 OAD's major focus is achieving greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation through operations research methodologies such as: statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations. Division analysts are credited with innovations in analysis of amphibious operations and Irregular Warfare (IW) that have expanded state-of-the-art operations research methods across DOD. OAD quantifies resource allocation decisions pertaining to weapon systems, strategic personnel, training management, and equipment acquisition.OAD provides day-to-day oversight of Marine Corps M&amp;S policy, standards,enterprise architecture, S&amp;T requirements, and workforce development

Efforts are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan, Marine Corps Operating Concepts (MOC) which provides the foundation and context for subordinate operating and functional concepts; guides analysis; wargaming scenarios and experimentation; wargaming capability development designed to examine, scope  and evaluate conceptual technological and operational principles and methods; informs capability development and budget programming decisions; CD&amp;I Force Development Strategic Plan which provides Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC)/Combat Development and Integration (CD&amp;I) personnel framework designed to promote  collaborative, cohesive, "learning organization" that can effectively prepare the Nation's expeditionary force in readiness for a complex and uncertain future envisioned by the Department of Defense, the Department of the Navy, and the Commandant,and FRAGO 2017 to support the USMC to adapt, innovate, and change to meet future threats. 

Future studies support Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF's) and Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU's) with research analysis and modeling and simulation focused on aviation, amphibious, warfighting, and ground operations enhancing the ability of the Marine Corps to increase operational, logistical and equipment efficiencies and capabilities and provide a unique, well trained, equipped and educated force.  

This program element has been revised into two specialized analytical divisions: (1) External Analysis Division (EAD) - responsible for providing joint external analysis is the Marine Corps' sole representative in the joint modeling arenas.  Provides deployed on site professional operations analysis support to Special Purpose MAGTFs in CENTCOM and AFRICOM.  (2) Combat Development Analysis Division responsible for executing a select portfolio of studies for senior leadership, Capabilities Based Assessment (CAB) and Marine Corps Enterprise Integration Plan (MCEIP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) supports the material acquisition process by managing the Marine Corps Operational Test (OT) programs for Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I through ACAT IV (less OT of manned aircraft) and performs other functions that may be directed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.

Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) consists of equipment, systems, and services designed to provide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces the capabilities needed to effectively respond to a terrorist attack using Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE). FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research &amp; Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY19, Allied/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID) (now called Allied/Coalition Maritime Environment (ACME)) Project 0798, Space &amp; Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering Project 2144, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Architecture Project 2147 were realigned from PE 0604707N to PE 0606355N.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FY 2019 funding request for project 2144 was reduced by $2.222 million and project 3319 was reduced by $1.840M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Allied/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID) project now called Allied/Coalition Maritime Environment (ACME) 0798:
This project promotes interoperability with allied and coalition forces by facilitating maritime interoperability in both processes and communication systems, including emerging capabilities, to counter growing high-end asymmetric threats. 

Space &amp; Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering 2144:
This project is a systems engineering non-acquisition program to develop, test, implement Technical Authority (TA) products, and validate Naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System architectures to support naval, Joint and Coalition missions across normal, contested, and degraded cyber/operational environments.  The objective of this project is carried out by multiple tasks that ensure development and delivery of naval Information Warfare (IW) capabilities that are well-integrated, interoperable, secure, and resilient to meet validated warfighting requirements.  

The Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Architecture 2147:
This project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR POR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture.

Fleet Experimentation 3319:  
The U.S. Navy's Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) project advances/augments operational and tactical warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The main focus of FLEX between 2018 and 2023 is to operationalize "A Design For Maintaining Maritime Superiority" Blue Line of Effort (LOE) through the execution of Fleet Design materiel/non-materiel capability employment.  

Trident Warrior Project 3320: 
The U.S. Navy's FLEX Trident Warrior (TW) experimentation campaign enables early delivery of capabilities to the warfighter via Fleet-directed Trident Warrior operational events with an emphasis on United States Fleet Forces/Commander Pacific Fleet (USFF/CPF) directed focus areas.  Trident Warrior was transferred from 0604231N (Tactical Command Systems) to 0606355N (Warfare Innovation Management) in FY17.
  
Maritime Communications Demonstration Project 3420:
Classified Project Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) is not a new start.  Funding was realigned from project 3319 FLEX in FY18. The Expeditionary SFOC Communications is developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both materiel and non-materiel methodologies to provide resilient command and control within the maritime domain.  Identified previous work done within OSD channels, and will leverage lessons learned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Project title changed as follows:  Allied/Coalition Maritime Environment (ACME) (Previously called Allied/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID) in FY17 and prior.)</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The ACME program advances Information Warfare (IW) (to include Command, Control, Communications, Computers; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Electronic Warfare (EW); and Cyber Warfare), interoperability with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States (AUSCANNZUKUS), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other Allied and Coalition partners. The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACME program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy (USN) expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Mission Partner Environment/ Future Mission Networking (MPE/FMN), the U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System - eXtended (BICES-X), and with the Joint Information Environment (JIE).
Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Denied, Degraded, Intermittent and Low-bandwidth (DDIL) operations, and to counter Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) threats. Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich IW data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, to include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities as well as Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in secure data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support Navy objectives in advancing Information Warfare (IW) capabilities, the Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering project provides six main functions:

(1) Develop the architectures, specifications and standards, tools, and processes to support a single integrated Navy plan for cybersecurity. These engineering artifacts provide Navy specific guidance to drive common and consistent implementation of security controls across current and future Navy Programs of Record/projects. This eliminates redundancies and inefficiencies characteristic of previous stove-pipe development efforts in which each system addressed security individually. These efforts enable a standardized approach to move out faster to improve the Navy's cyber resiliency. 

(2) Provide the cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability which supports cybersecurity test requirements and the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) components of USS Secure. USS Secure is a cyber assessment program within the Navy. This System of Systems (SoS) (Afloat, Aloft, C4I &amp; Shore) capability in a test laboratory environment provides a rapidly re-configurable capability that integrates maritime hardware systems into a virtual platform. This platform level SoS provides cybersecurity research, development, test and evaluation, and training, not otherwise possible. This combination of Systems Commands (SYSCOM) laboratories, cyber ranges, and Red Teams simulating Navy platforms in operational maritime environments is critical for effectively evaluating cyber threats against specified mission threads.

(3) Define an integrated Enterprise Architecture to support design, development and delivery of integrated Navy Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System capabilities. This architecture reflects current (as-is) and future (target) end states to support technical analyses, program planning, and enterprise-level investment decisions across IW capabilities. Perform mission based system of systems analysis to ensure integration and interoperability, and validate end-to-end warfighting capabilities to quickly address emerging threats. 

(4) Provides engineering tools and processes to drive rigorous Systems Engineering discipline across the acquisition lifecycle to support rapid development and delivery of secure and interoperable C4ISR, Business IT, and Space Systems capabilities that meet Fleet requirements. Conduct Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) to provide independent, objective assessments of technical maturity and compliance with applicable architectures, specifications and standards across IW capabilities. 

(5) The Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX) provides a means to demonstrate and evaluate the interoperability of United States (US), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and coalition information sharing systems.

(6) Navy Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology aligns to CNO priorities to deliver revolutionary capabilities to improve fleet readiness.  These enterprise solutions will provide the foundation to (1) enhance warfighter capability through new innovative system designs; (2) increase readiness through low volume production of hard to source items; and (3) improve warfighting capacity by enabling production at or near the point of need. Specific efforts include the development of an Enterprise Digital Manufacturing Architecture which addresses design and certification of AM capabilities for both afloat and ashore, development of Cyber Security Risk Management Profiles for devices and applications on operational networks, definition of a secure Technical Data Package to describe components that can be digitally manufactured, and the development of an overarching, enterprise-level Digital Manufacturing Thread (device management, digital rights management, licensing, configuration management, data storage rule/access and application programing interfaces).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Integrated architectures provide a technical framework for assessing capability gaps and performance of individual systems and System of Systems (SoS) and their ability to effectively provide the desired effects to support warfighting missions. They also serve as a means to influence and drive Programs of Record (PoR) toward a common, more efficient state that promotes interoperability and security.

The Naval Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Reference Architecture project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment and Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment and Space &amp; Naval Warfare Systems Command-wide Enterprise Architecture policies. This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR PoR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture. These efforts will help reduce Information Technology/ISR infrastructure complexity and variances, making it easier to manage, operate and defend our ISR capabilities, and help inform investment decisions across the Navy's ISR enterprise to support Assured Command and Control, Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires.

This effort will encompass the documentation and analysis of current ISR enterprise architectures to inform and guide requirements for target architecture development and performance requirements to support full use and incorporation of ISR capabilities to advance Navy operations afloat. The associated studies will produce both technical and non-technical implementation guidance across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities spectrum.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The U.S. Navy's Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program examines the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to identified warfighter capability gaps within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). The Navy's FLEX program considers warfighting gaps identified in: Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL) generated by Warfighting Development Centers (WDC); Navy Integrated Priorities Letter (IPL); Navy Commanders' FLEX Guidance; and Navy Urgent Operational Needs Statements.  Additionally, the Navy's FLEX program addresses innovative concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps.   Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war simulations, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Naval-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&amp;T), academia, and industry partners.

The U.S. Navy's FLEX program directly supports four of the five elements outlined in the Secretary of the Navy's Innovation Vision: (1) Build the Naval Innovation Network, (2) Improve the Use of DON Information, (3) Accelerate Emerging Operational Capabilities to the Fleet, and (4) Develop Game-Changing Warfighting Concepts.  Experimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The FLEX program deliverables are focused on operational and tactical warfighting capability in the near term (within the Future Years Defense Program), and prioritized by annual U.S. Navy guidance.  Warfighting Development Centers (WDCs) plans and executes approved multi-year Fleet experimentation campaigns and final reports. U. S. Navy staff manages the follow-on DOTMLPF-P actions to establish or enhance warfighting capability in Fleet Design, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Surface Warfare (SUW), Strike Warfare (STW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Expeditionary Warfare (EXW), Information Dominance (ID), Mine Warfare (MIW) and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP)
 
FLEX supports Operational/Tactical venues to experiment, demonstrate, assess warfighting CONOPS development, concepts, doctrine/training development, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and technologies. Multi-year experiment campaigns focus on warfighting capability in accordance with guidance to evaluate and transition to DOTMLPF-Policy change recommendations.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>The Navy's FY19 FLEX program aligns to the U.S. Navy Fleet Design and the Associated Campaign Plan will drive implementation of Fleet Design by 2023.  

Realizing Fleet Design necessitates introduction of three enabling components.  

(1) Fleet Fighting Power via Distributed Maritime Operations - Material/Non- Material Capabilities.  The FY19 FLEX program will execute the following events:  

a. Command and Control 
b. Operational Level Multi-Domain Joint Enablers 
c. Maneuver Fleet Tactical Grid
d. Cooperative Engagements Mode Options 

(2) Digital Spectrum Warfare via a Fleet Tactical Grid will integrate communications, command and control systems, computers, sensors, combat systems, and weapons at the technical level to facilitate an intelligent exchange and analysis of data to provide warfighters with actionable knowledge in support of Distributed Maritime Operations. The FY19 FLEX program will execute the following events:  

a. Combat Identification and Targeting
b. Battlespace Management and Decision Aids 
c. Tactical Networking
d. NET Enabled Weapons
e. Unmanned Systems Autonomy
f. Sensor/Platform/Weapon Employment
g. Fleet Tactical Grid/Netted Sensors

(3) Fleet Warfighting Training Construct (FWTC) will develop a holistic, agile, and integrated environment that replicates the high end fight, to train a fleet centric fighting force and allow for future warfighting innovation within the construct of Force Generation.  As such, Fleet Design implementation requires fleet experimentation to support Force Development and inform Force Generation for fleet-centric fighting power, enabled by integration, distribution and maneuver to simultaneously employ synchronized kinetic/non-kinetic mission execution across multiple domains in a complex/contested environment.  The FY19 FLEX program will execute the following events:  

a. Tactical and Technical Integration in support of FWTC Force Generation, Large Scale Exercise (LSE) 2020; specifically, increased use of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) lines of effort to accelerate capability development and learning.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) project, also called the Expeditionary Submarine Fiber Optic Cable (SFOC) Communications Project, is a classified program responsible for developing concepts designed to validate material and non-material solutions providing resilient C2 within the maritime domain. The focus is to demonstrate capabilities leveraging existing DOD investments and infrastructure to move data and information. Demonstration will include maritime assets, experimental methodologies, and current backhaul architecture for data movement. Solutions will address technologies across the RF and Optical spectrum using SFOC communications systems. The key deliverable will be a series of at-sea demonstrations to validate maritime segment components in an operationally representative environment.

This is not a new start.  In FY17 $2.8M of funding was managed from within the Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program and used for Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) project tasking for transparency.  This effort is part of Secretary of Defense's (SECDEF) third offset initiative and was identified as a required operational capability by USEUCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USSTRATCOM.  This effort will fund limited technical development and a series of at-sea demonstrations raising the technical readiness levels of various components with a cable handling and deployment system in an operationally representative environment, with the intent to rapidly transition to an operational capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Initial project planning activities to result in an end-to-end shallow water communications demonstration on a Southern California Navy range in FY19. Award of a vendor contract to deliver the expeditionary cable handling and deployment system. System architecture and design of the deployable communications segment to include initial lab demonstration of communications CONOPS in September, 2017. Note: The $4.7M HAC mark made the planned FY19 shallow water comms test unexecutable as initially envisioned. That fact, combined with revised sponsor guidance received in Q4FY17, resulted in a complete replanning of the MCD project late in FY17.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This effort provides an OT&amp;E approach to protect Marine Corps critical Cyber information and intelligence through vulnerability evaluations of all major DoD weapons systems and critical military installations; as directed by Section 1650 of Public Law 114-328 (NDAA for FY2017) and Section 1647 of Public Law 114-92 (NDAA FY2016).  This will be accomplished through protection, detection, response, restoration, remediation, and mitigation. Testing and evaluation will be completed at Marine Corps facilities and Government Labs, to include the Marine Corps Cyber Range and Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA).

Sec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. 

Sec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. 

Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Assessments will end in 2020 with the submission of the final report. Strategies mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Cyber Vulnerability Assessments and Evaluations program funds for cyber vulnerability assessments of major Navy weapons systems and cyber vulnerability assessments of critical shore infrastructure as directed by Sec. 1647 of the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA, respectively.  Funding will be used for assessments and non-recurring engineering for mitigations related to the  Navy's major weapons systems identified in Joint Requirements Oversight Committee Memorandum (JROCM) 039-16 and on prioritized critical shore infrastructure prioritized.

Sec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. 

Sec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. 

Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize Department of Energy (DoE) and Department of Defense (DoD) national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress. Strategies and procedures for mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Vulnerability Assessments and Evaluations program funds cyber vulnerability assessments of critical shore infrastructure as directed by Section 1650 of the FY17 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  Funding will be used for assessments of prioritized critical shore infrastructure.  Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize DoE and DoD national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress. Strategies and procedures for mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:Description>

This includes those systems integrated into, as well as supporting, critical infrastructure for the Navy. As directed by Congressional language, these all-inclusive vulnerability assessments will require the development of multifaceted testing capabilities within the Navy shore domain while leveraging existing resources across the Fleet in addition to strategies and competencies from our national laboratory partners. Supporting these vulnerability assessments will be the identification and development of mission modeling artifacts outlining the relationship between those identified facility related control systems and the relevant DoD and Navy mission and operational plans. These efforts will provide increased survivability and cyber resiliency of the Naval shore domain.</r2:Text>

Counter Insider Threat program accomplishes these objectives by monitoring users' computers and network activities, fusing that information with security risk data from multiple other sources, and providing the fused information to analysts for threat identification and initial response action.  All agencies that manage classified networks are required to establish an Insider Threat program consisting of UAM and an Analytical Hub.  Navy will come under increased Congressional scrutiny if Insider Threat does not maintain funding in future POMs.

Navy currently does not fully meet Counter Insider Threat Capability requirements.  As the Counter Insider Threat Mission requires Navy to establish a new capability to identify a specific type of person, as defined above,  RDT&amp;E,N funding is required to appropriately create this capability effectively.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to: 1) Exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) Understand the disposition of friendly forces; 3) Target and conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) Assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

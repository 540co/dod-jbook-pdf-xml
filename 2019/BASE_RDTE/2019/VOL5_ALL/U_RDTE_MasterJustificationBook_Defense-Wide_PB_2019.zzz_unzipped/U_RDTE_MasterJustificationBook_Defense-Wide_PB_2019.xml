In FY17 the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) will focus on the conceptual design of a modernized MOCAS Technical Architecture to further drive efficiencies in how the Agencies perform their Contract Administration and Contract Pay missions. The current MOCAS technical environment aligns with 1960s techniques and is limiting our development choices while stifling innovation. While some of the underlying MOCAS system technology has been upgraded (most recently in the 1980s), the fundamental architecture has not been updated. The approach for performing architecture and technology upgrades for the MOCAS system is complicated and will require multiple initiatives (Business Process Reengineering (BPR), Organizational Change Management (OCM) , prototyping and technical evaluations) working together to maintain business functionality as we enhance the system. These initiatives include upgrading the user interface to a modern interactive web experience, establishing configurable workflows and business rules in the system, updating the persistent data storage technologies in use, and augmenting the reporting and system interfaces to enhance interoperability within the DoD. Additionally and in parallel, the MOCAS JPMO will move from design to development on three major/complex System Change Requests (SCRs), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 850/860 recycle, Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID), and Single Line of Accounting (SLOA) with projected implementation late FY 2017/ mid FY 2018 and late FY 2018 respectively. The need for these system changes is driven not only by our internal stakeholders and customers, but also by directives and policies received from various regulatory sources such as the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO); Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L); Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP); and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)/FAR. Appropriate investment is required to implement these changes that will help the DoD move closer to achieving key goals for improving financial controls and audit trails that promote end-to-end funds traceability, compliance with data standards, and adoption of modern technologies to improve interoperability across the DoDs Procure-to Pay mission.

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCMA is invigorating efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  In pursuing these business practices, we are continuing to utilize both government full time equivalents and contractors to perform specialized functions such as software development, testing, and process automation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>To deliver on our mission and vision, the Agency is focused on four primary goals:  1) inform and contribute to cost control and affordability decisions; 2) develop agile business practices which optimize mission execution and support to the acquisition enterprise; 3) create and maintain an agile learning organization and culture that strives to exceed customer expectations; and 4) expect of ourselves what we expect of our contractors:  good fiscal stewardship.  All four of the strategic goals go directly to the heart of the DCMA mission.  The Agency helps our partners spend their finite dollars wisely, ultimately ensuring the front line Warfighters get the equipment and services they need when they need them.  Adherence to executing and ultimately attaining these goals will posture DCMA to positively support current and future Better Buying Power initiatives and initiatives in Services acquisition, innovative science and technology, and efforts to ensure greater acquisition affordability, and better cost control throughout the acquisition life cycle. Agency focus will not solely rest on qualitative contract administration functions, but will also focus on quantitative factors as well – those factors that will clearly emphasize the Agency’s return on investment (ROI) to the Department and to our other customers and the taxpayers at large.The Agency recognizes the obligation to be effective stewards of the funds we receive. In 2016, DCMA's return on investment to the Department and our other customers was $2 for each $1 invested by DoD. Additional ROI for the Department is the expanded and expanding DCMA commercial pricing expertise that will continue to improve DoD buying power, the Services' lethality, operational readiness, and sustainment posture.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

RDTE funding in FY18 was applied to the start-up costs for expanding the recruiting database provided to all Military Services for use with officer and enlisted recruiting and to explore the merits of expanding use to civilian recruiting as proposed in a Force of the Future initiative. Specifically, the funds would provide contractor support for the development of a pilot expanded database, procurement of additional directory lists, and the purchase of IT hardware and software for the development of a user- friendly interface for accessing the data.  FY19 RDTE funds in HSPD-12 will be applied to research and investigation of multifactor authentication alternatives that may allow DoD to supplement current public key infrastructure and DoD Self-Service Logon authentication solutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

HSPD-12 requires rapid electronic authentication for all Government employees, uniformed individuals and contractors. Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) is the infrastructure that supports the Uniformed Services identification card, provides on-line updates to DEERS and issues the CAC to Service members, civilian employees, and eligible contractors, thus providing an enterprise-wide credential for both physical and logical access to DoD facilities and networks. CAC uses the DEERS database for authentication and personnel information.

Recruiting Databases Project: FY 2018 funds were directed to completing the expansion of recruiting database from the pilot started in FY 2017.  It will be provided to all Military Services for use with officer and enlisted recruiting and to explore the merits of expanding use to civilian recruiting.  Specifically, the funds will provide contractor support to research efforts on expanding the JAMRS Recruiting database for more precise direct messaging and run micro-targeting pilots with third party data buys.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&amp;R)).  This PE includes application of R&amp;D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and/or modernize operations required for general RDT&amp;E.

For FY 2017, as a result of a Business Process and Systems Review, DHRA implemented a major reorganization that impacted the DHRA RDT&amp;E budget.  The most significant aspect of this reorganization, from a RDT&amp;E perspective, was the integration of the Enterprise Human Resources Information System (EHRIS) into the Defense Manpower Data Center’s (DMDC) portfolio of information technology (IT) initiatives.  Additionally, DHRA has implemented a major reorganization of the DMDC programs to more accurately align budget program lines with the DHRA Information Technology (IT) data reported in the DHRA IT Budget.  The Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS); Data Governance; Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS); Common Access Card (CAC); the Cyber Security program has been integrated into the DEERS and RAPIDS programs, with CAC being retained as part of the RAPIDS program.  Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) has been integrated into a Personnel Accountability (PA) program, that also includes Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and the Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).

Project 1: DCPDS - this project is described below in Project #10 EHRIS where it has been realigned.

Project 5:  ESGR Awards &amp; Activity Tracking (AATR) Tool. Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) requires a comprehensive web-based application (Awards and Activity Tracking and Reporting) to track ESGR Activities to include briefings and recognition of civilian employers and briefings of National Guard and Reserve that will track against organizational goals vs. costs and the hours donated by Volunteers.  The application will replace several manual processes that use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets across 54 State Committees and through contractor support.  This will also place all critical data in a DoD Data Center. Development of a web-based application would immensely improve data collection and analysis while allowing field staff and volunteers to better focus on operations and mission accomplishment.  The application would be an addition to ESGR’s current Portal that contains ESGR’s member management, inquiry and case management, and freedom award nomination systems. 

Project 6:  Enterprise Data Management (EDS) is addressing two critical projects in FY 2019: 1) JOM and 2) EDDIE.  1) The Joint Officer Management (JOM) modernization initiative will support improvements in the Joint Manpower Information System’s (JMIS) automation, reliability, accuracy, and system interoperability to enable the Department to more effectively comply with Title 10 management requirements of Joint Duty Officers in the Active and Reserve forces, and improve the sight picture of joint officer personnel capabilities and readiness for the SECDEF and the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  The JMIS is the DoD’s sole IT system to inform the SECDEF and CJCS on their operational joint personnel officer readiness capability.  The system is used to track joint duty billets, and the officers assigned to them. It also tracks joint duty experiences, education, training, and qualifications for facilitation of joint duty officer assignments and promotions.  The legacy system was built in the 1990’s and is no longer agile enough to support today’s mission.  This modernization project will bring JOM into the 21st century while addressing critical compliance issue around cyber security, and legislative and policy changes for which the legacy system has been unable to keep pace.  2) The Enterprise Data to Decisions Information Environment (EDDIE) introduces a streamlined way to provide person based “data as a service” and “analytics as a service” to all of DoD and other Federal Agencies. It enables and improves all types of analytics from standard reporting to more emergent and embedded predictive/prescriptive analytics.  EDDIE will assist decision makers in forming relevant questions, retrieving pertinent information, and informing policy and program changes.  In FY 2019, the Office of People Analytics (OPA) and Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) will collaborate with the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), Policy Offices, and other stakeholders to perform business process reengineering to improve the approval processes to gain access to the data, define workflow, and to define the minimal and optimal data universe required for the collaborative environment.  FY 2019 will perform the architecture, design, and Analysis of Alternatives for the environment including at a minimum evaluation of the DISA Data Lake, CIO Data Environment, and PDE Enhancement.

Project 7:  Defense Sexual Assault Incidents Database. The Defense Sexual Assault Incidents Database (DSAID) is the integrated DoD SAPR Data Collection and Reporting System that accommodates a variety of uses, including the tracking of sexual assault victim support services, support Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) program administration, program reporting requirements, and data analysis. In order to facilitate analysis at the OSD level, the System will be able to easily export data for analysis in computerized statistical applications, such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).  Service field-level users use the system to track support to victims of sexual assault throughout the lifecycle of that support requirement and to facilitate sexual assault case transfer between the Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs) and Services.  Service headquarters-level users use the system to support program planning, analysis, and management.  DoD SAPR Office (SAPRO) users and Service headquarters-level users access the system to produce mandated and requested reports, monitor program effectiveness and support cohort and trend analysis.

Project 8:  Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program.  The Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) mission is to provide assistive technology and accommodations to support individuals with disabilities and wounded, ill, and injured Service members throughout the Federal Government in accessing information and communication technology.  CAP currently has partnerships with 69 federal agencies.  CAP’s wounded, ill, and injured Service member’s initiative is designed to cover active duty Service members, to include Guard or Reserve who are on active duty orders, including Title 10 orders.  Since its inception, the program has provided over 150,000 accommodations for Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD employees with disabilities and wounded, ill, and injured Service members. 

Currently CAP utilizes a Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) product designed to support the program’s robust mission.  This product, CAP Portal, is used primarily to process DoD and other government agencies requests for hardware, software, training, and other miscellaneous accommodation services.  CAP Portal also processes information pertaining to developing and tracking requirements packages, market research, events and outreach to include proposals, presentations, materials, and assistive technology.  The CAP Portal allows staff and contract support personnel to utilize all aspects of its functionality to facilitate the provision of reasonable accommodations, and run various reports to make financial forecasts with the data that is contained within the system.

Project 9:  OPA Testing and Assessment Division administers testing programs, which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits.  The DoD uses a single test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress.  High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600,000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program, and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years.  This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise.  Ongoing RDT&amp;E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development, calibration, and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information.  In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn. 

Project 10:  The Enterprise Human Resource Information System (EHRIS) is comprised of the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), Civilian HR IT Managed Services, Civilian HR IT Enterprise Services, and Civilian HR IT Program Planning and Management.  
- DCPDS is the DoD enterprise civilian personnel HR system, servicing approximately 800,000 users worldwide.  The system holds all authoritative civilian employee “personal data” and personnel actions, and provides HR business capabilities to support the end-to-end HR line of business and employee self-service capabilities, such as benefits election.  The DCPDS program implements systems training, testing, and requirements management that provides user and administrator training for DCPDS and performs integrated testing for DCPDS and DoD HR IT systems to ensure proper operations throughout their life cycles.  
-Civilian HR IT Managed Services is responsible to customers for deployment and management of civilian HR IT systems delivered to the DoD by external government service providers, such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Services currently managed include staff acquisition (USA Jobs and USA Staffing) and the electronic official personnel folders (eOPF).  DMDC’s role is to centrally manage the Department’s requirements for these services so that the service provider (in most cases OPM) is working with a single point of contact at DoD. 
-Civilian HR IT Enterprise Services is responsible to customers for the development, operations, and sustainment of all other enterprise civilian HR IT capabilities not provided by DCPDS or external government service providers.  These systems are typically unique to the DoD and allow the DoD to automate the remainder of the end-to-end HR line of business.  
-Civilian HR IT Program Planning and Management centralizes civilian HR IT planning and strategy activities within DMDC in order to create an integrated plan for the future that both aligns with higher level guidance and takes into account requirements and priorities across the Department for automation of civilian HR IT processes.  This program works with functional sponsors and users to produce validated functional requirements, as well as technical requirements that apply to all DoD HR IT systems. 

Project 11:  Personnel Accountability program is comprised of several systems, including: Synchronized Pre-deployment Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), Defense Travel System (DTS)/Defense Travel System Modernization and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilian, contractor and U.S. citizens.  This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  

Project 12:  Personnel Security Assurance (PSA) provides comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians and contractors including the technology and processes that need to be addressed in order to implement Continuous Evaluation.  Funding in this program support the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) which transferred to DHRA/DMDC from DLA in FY 2017.  The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. 

Project 13:  The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) administers many of the federal responsibilities of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) of 1986 and other federal military voter registration and assistance laws.  FVAP works to ensure Service members, their eligible family members and overseas citizens are aware of their right to vote and have the tools and resources to successfully do so – from anywhere in the world.  FVAP works to Increase the likelihood of interested Active Duty Members to use available FVAP resources to increase their level of awareness of available DoD voting assistance resources, which will increase the likelihood of returning their absentee ballot.  FVAP conducts voting research projects with States, local election jurisdictions and private entities to assist UOCAVA voters to register to vote and submit their absentee ballot and improve federal, State and local election processes and procedures.

Project 14:  Defense Travel System-Modernization (Pilot) - The DoD Travel System Pilot Program (DTSPP), is part of the DTS-M effort, to determine the viability of using commercial-off-the-shelf software as a service (CSaaS) to conduct DoD travel.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cybersecurity deals with the unauthorized exposure of classified data to sites such as WikiLeaks which raised awareness on the need for improved data security management and access control measures across DoD IT enterprise.  Cross Domain Information Sharing (CDS) provides for protected, automated transfer of data across networks of different security classifications reducing the need for removable media while better safe guarding the transport of information from one network to another.  DMDC is developing the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS)/Access Based Access Control technology in the classified environment as an immediate deterrent to allow/deny access to classified information giving the DoD the ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g., using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication).  Further, DOD will have the ability to enable, monitor and control the authorized transfer of information between SIPRNET and other DOD Networks as required via globally available and operationally effective cross domain enterprise service solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In order to enhance areas of program data-tracking capabilities and stabilize the environment for future operations, CAP requires modernization of CAP Portal.  The CAP Portal has pages/controls that have accumulated up to 7,000 lines of code, making it difficult to ensure the reliability of any updates made to the system which has undergone over 500 change requests since its launch.
There are components and functionality that are no longer being utilized and others needed, but it is risky to remove or disable due to the interconnected nature of the codebase.  The current codebase utilizes an outdated framework that is difficult to maintain.  The CAP Modernization Project will implement a .NET Model View Controller (MVC) framework to separate the business, display and input layers of the code.  As CAP’s operating procedures evolve, CAP Portal’s current structure will not match the changing business needs of its users.  Towards that end, the issue of restructuring CAP Portal is necessary to ensure flexibility and reliability moving forward.  As a result of an outdated framework, the current CAP Portal is becoming increasingly challenging to maintain and less reliable when making updates.  The CAP Modernization Project will provide a restructured database for CAP Portal with an updated codebase to provide a solid foundation that supports CAP’s current structure and business processes while also increasing flexibility for future enhancements and efficiencies.  All aspects of CAP Portal will be enhanced by this project, which will provide a streamlined foundation on which to incorporate new internal processing workflow entitled ONE CAP.  It will provide the ability to implement new processes that reflect the current organization, roles, responsibilities, tasks and specific workflow and assignments.  The modernization of technology will ensure full integration of the new internal operating model.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

One such effort will be increasing the ability for CAP Staff to update content on the CAP website, CAP Mobile App, and communications template to reduce dependence on external resources to make these changes.  Also included are development efforts aimed at enhancing the ability of CAP Staff to document process actions within the system in support of procurement and acquisition records keeping requirements as well as to facilitate effective relationship management between CAP, the DoD, Federal partner agencies, and other stakeholders.  Another major effort will be increasing the self-service accessibility of information to CAP customers to reduce the level of effort required to pass on information regarding their requests for reasonable accommodation.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The planned Civilian HR automation enhancements are focused on software development to rationalize and modernize legacy systems and standalone systems to support the Department’s civilian workforce, including a DoD-Wide performance management system; enhancement of employee competency assessment capability and talent management; modernization of the Priority Placement Program and Reemployment Priority List; and integration of succession planning.  In addition, changes to the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) are required for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) mandates, HR Line of Business (LoB) directives, electronic Official Personnel Folder changes, and Retirement Systems Modernization implementation.  DoD is one of five designated Shared Service Centers in the federal government focused on providing standard services across agency lines, potentially gaining significant business and cost-saving benefits.  DoD is considered a leader in this initiative.

DCPDS is the Department’s enterprise civilian HR system that has proven a recurring $200M annual cost-avoidance originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which continues to operate as the DoD system serving over 800,000 employee records.  Additional initiatives to sustain the Department’s lead in automated systems include expansion the Oracle eBusiness Suite (EBS) capability to provide self-service functionality, centralized payroll support, and data warehouse improvements.  Compliance with a number of directives, such as Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) and Financial Audit Readiness (FIAR), drive additional consolidation requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PA program is comprised of three sub-programs: Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and the Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).   This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, contractors, and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  SPOT is the DoD system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation.  JPARR is a "public" SIPR only application that provides daily person- level location reporting.  JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail.  NTS is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In coordination with PACOM, DMDC will be creating the ability to pre-populate a NEO with the affected population to ensure faster more accurate accountability.   Personnel Accountability will be looking at an effort to analyze and develop a plan to migrate SPOT-ES from the .NET framework to the Java technology stack standard supported by DMDC which will allow development and operations to live on DMDC shared application infrastructure.   

Personnel Accountability will also work towards several new modernization efforts to include development and implementation of distributed processing, business intelligence and geographic information system (GIS) tools to support the Contingency Tracking System (CTS) and Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR) systems.  Additionally we will research and create an integration plan for the possible use of Blue Force Tracking data and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) scanning technologies for evacuation and personnel accounting operations.</r2:Text>

•  Assess the impact of previous efforts to enact structured data feeds from the States and localities with the most populous number of military and overseas voters. 
•  Identify and assess the process to assess voter residency and how it impacts overseas citizen voters attempting to vote in federal elections.  
•  Study the extent to which States enact authorizations for the use and acceptance of electronic signatures derived from the Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC), or its successor. 
•  Identify the feasibility and risks associated with a comprehensive approach for States to establish a single statewide office with the technology and software to process UOCAVA absentee balloting materials. 
•  Monitor the implementation, adoption and impact of clearinghouse recommendations and voting technology practices.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Each project contained within this program contains specific metrics to determine progress towards completion. Metrics for all include completed and documented analysis provided by the performer. The completion date for that analysis varies with each project. In addition, to that analysis, each effort contains a roadmap addressing the best use of the findings throughout the department. If the results of the analysis show benefit to the Department, those findings are included in policy, doctrine, tactics and procedures.  The project will yield actionable findings on how to best assist UOCAVA voters while reducing the overall reporting burden for these States to provide data on the number of absentee ballots transmitted to and received from military and overseas citizens after each federal election.  Process mappings about how the Federal Post Card Application and the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot, are treated by States for uniformed overseas and civilian overseas citizens and the impact of their residency classifications will identify the extent of uniformed and civilian overseas citizens who vote.   The acceptance of electronic signatures derived from the Common Access Card within the Department provides significant potential for ensuring the absentee balloting process is seamless for active duty military members by permitting the use of an electronic signing and submission of an absentee ballot application in those States that permit an electronic submission.  This will measure the extent to which States have proceeded with the consideration and adoption of authorizing statutes or administrative rules to permit the use of electronic signatures in a limited fashion and for a limited population of uniformed overseas voters.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The JS J-4, in collaboration with the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) approved the transition of GCSS-J to a SharePoint-based Logistics Common Operational Picture.  The PMO will introduce SharePoint server within the GCSS-J enclave to provide an Enterprise SharePoint Solution which integrates the automated data services and visualizations provided by GCSS-J and supports site specific user defined operational pictures (UDOP).  This will promote standardization across CCMDs and allow CCMDs to use their primary SharePoint portal or alternative work space to visualize and share data with other CCMDs. Additionally, the functional sponsor approved the development of widgets to support the Operational Contract Support (OCS) community allowing visibility of contractor management, awarded procurements, and emerging requirements.</r2:Text>

The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements. By stating the requirements in a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements Document as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4. These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.

Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J PMO. The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are of benefiting the user. Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed. These tools become increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications, which allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services. As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics will ensure that the system is meeting user requirements.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), manages the Department’s Interoperability Test, Evaluation, and Certification process that is structured to provide meaningful and independent test results in order to increase stakeholder confidence.  The objectives, of the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities, are to validate that DISA’s (and the Department’s, where appropriate) deliverables have met operational requirements.  The T&amp;E activities target evaluation strategies in the design, development, operational, integration and/or sustainment aspects of every program requiring support.  DISA’s T&amp;E efforts span a variety of test categories supporting DISA’s delivery of Department-wide enterprise solutions as well as Service, Agency, and mission partner developmental, operational, Information Assurance, and interoperability testing, validation and certification efforts. These efforts are focused on T&amp;E for Information Technology (IT) that includes the Joint Information Environment (JIE), Cyber, Cloud services, and Mobility. 

As the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, JITC annually: 
  •  Issues hundreds of interoperability testing and certification related products.
  •  Manages the scheduling and executes multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link hardware in the loop interoperability test events.  These events are designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical Data systems.
  •  Reviews hundreds of Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System documents, interoperability support plans and Legacy Waiver requests on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Joint Staff. 
  •  Serves as executive agent to DoD Interoperability Steering Group, in support of the DoD CIO, and uses this forum to coordinate policy, adjudicate issues, and to process Interim Certificates to Operate.
  •  Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications annually for DoD’s Information Technology and National Security Systems (IT/NSS). 
  •  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

JITC provides interoperability test support to Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in theater by providing Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and supports exercises intended to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by: 
  •  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) as required, and conducting assessments of interoperability exercises.  
  •  Conducting assessments during one of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).
  •  Broadening its support to the Joint Staff and functional COCOMs with a multitude of interoperability assessment services. 
  •  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Interoperability Hotline that connects warfighters to subject matter experts to resolve IT interoperability challenges. 
  •  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and the status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).
  •  Emulating a distributed Joint Task Force network, providing realism and operational significance during the assessments and evaluations of data integrity, interfacing and responsiveness coupled with efficient configuration tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
  •  Including first responder local and federal communications as part of the task force. 
 
As the only non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA) within DoD, JITC conducts operational testing of IT/NSS under realistic conditions to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and security; and independently assesses the operational impact of system issues on mission accomplishment.  JITC is the OTA for DISA-managed programs, and also upon request serves as the OTA for other Agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency.

JITC designs Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) events to determine if IT/NSS meet user requirements, offering sustaining support services to users to assist Acquisition Program Managers with meeting their overall milestone objectives.  

JITC focuses its efforts towards core T&amp;E improvements, better T&amp;E policy for IT/NSS and designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, aligning with the Information Technology Service Management model evaluating fulfillment services for suitability.

The T&amp;E project supports the strategy development and investment plans in support of maintaining, improving and operating the DISA Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Specific goals for DISA’s MRTFB each year are to:  
  •  Integrate evolving technologies that are able to leverage efficiencies such as virtualization, enterprise elements such as Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, and the foundational Cyber assets mandated by the JIE.
  •  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, and federation across the DoD and Cyber integration with enterprise environments. 
  •  Design consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure efficient T&amp;E on changing or emerging technologies. 
  •  Provide T&amp;E guidance/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large DISA IT portfolio, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As an MRTFB, Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) provides tested IT infrastructure products to the DoD, Federal/non-Federal Government, Commercial vendors, and Allied partners.  

The DISA MRTFB infrastructure:

  •  Encompasses two geographic locations (Ft. Huachuca, AZ; Indian Head, MD; Ft. Meade, MD). 

  •  116K square feet of raised floor space comprised of multiple test environments and test networks supporting over a 100 programs on an annual basis.
  
  •  Complies with multiple levels of security and is scaled to support approximately 1,000 annual testing events to evaluate the DoD's converged information environment, Cyber, Cloud services, Mobility, and National Security     Systems (NSS).

  •  Encompasses a significant portfolio of reference implementations, test tools, and supporting IT systems to aid both test execution and data collection/analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The increase of +$9.356 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 will adapt additional cloud technologies through rapid re-configurations resulting in the development of a single DoDIN Lab Test-bed.  This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.822 attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus, the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States (US) forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North America Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  

A planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities; enabling network operation centers to priority command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, “non-mil” platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among United States (US) forces and multinational partners.

1) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations at the Secret Releasable level.  There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  

2) Pegasus connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the US, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. 

3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.

4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS) extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners, enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The MNIS Program also initiated a capability to support enhancements for the UISS-All Partners Access (APAN).  UISS-APAN migrated existing systems supporting coalition sharing to an enterprise solution hosted on a DISA Defense Enterprise Computing Center.  UISS-APAN capability will satisfy COCOM needs for tools and technology to support collaboration with non-traditional partners for humanitarian missions.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies. DISA's NMCS engineering program meets the NMCS systems engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.
The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS engineering focuses on implementing collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, integrating adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transitioning nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol based networks, migrating data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementing modern cryptological devices, and utilizing wireless networking to support warning systems and situational awareness. In addition, NMCS engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide required by DoDD S-5100.44 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies. DISA's NMCS engineering program meets the NMCS systems engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-3710.01 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3280.01C, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.							
							
The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS engineering focuses on implementation of collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, the integration of adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transition of nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks, migration of data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementation of modern crypto-logical devices, and the utilization of wireless networking to support warning systems and situational awareness. In addition, NMCS engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide (NRG) required by DoDD S-3710.01 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Integrate applicable portions of the NMCS into the National Leadership Commmand Capability (NLCC) portfolio.

The increase of +$1.288 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to application of the NLCC Configuration Management process to applicable NMCS systems and to provide engineering support for Northstar and SATSTAR services transition to new NLCC transport infrastructure. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.079 attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The JSEIO conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks. Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.

The NMCS met all FY 2017 performance metrics and is on track to meet its FY 2018 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within
allocated resources 100% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Will identify capability candidates for analysis; perform technical market research, alternatives analysis and trade-off studies of candidates within a defined  trade space; analyze and evaluate existing/new capabilities through engineering methods to include proof-of-concept demonstrations; and perform technical assessments to develop technical recommendations supporting solution development decisions.  Will analyze/prototype cloud computing services and open source capabilities for integration and interoperability with DoD capabilities. Will support application and implementation of SDN technologies for Core Data Centers and the DISN. Will continue to enhance end-to-end performance capabilities, including data collection and tools to support enterprise wide troubleshooting and analysis. The results will be socialized with the DoD community for action/adoption or further development. Where appropriate, the results will also be documented in GTP for compliance by the POR.

Will continue efforts to enhance modeling capabilities that will provide DISN IP and Transport Capacity Planning models and expand computing infrastructure modeling capabilities, modifying tools and processes to reflect the operational DODIN architecture and technologies as evolved under Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS) and the common informational architecture initiatives and technical advances. These enhancements include: (1) preparing for the FY 2019 Technology Refresh (feasibility analyses required prior to hardware being added to the DODIN) and new user requirements; (2) enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for new or evolving enterprise services and customer needs in DISA program/project decisions and planning; (3) DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives for CYBERCOM and organizations within DISA; (4) enhanced modeling tools and techniques to provide inputs to network planning and performance assessments in support of Unified Communications and End-to-End (E2E) security goals of the evolving DODIN; (5) capacity planning for data centers infrastructure computing and network;  and (6) an updated version of the Joint Communications Simulation System.

There is a decrease of -$1.499 between FY 2016 and  FY 2017. The FY 2017 funding will be used to broadened and enhanced modeling and simulation methodologies to properly identify the network planning and bandwidth sufficiency needs of the evolving DODIN.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EWSE uses contractors to assist/supplement the Government lead/team for technical activities. Subject matter experts in both large and small businesses are sought for the engineering support. Firm fixed price contracts with one option year are typically used in open competition. Furthermore, technical work with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) such as MITRE and MIT Lincoln Lab are established and coordinated when the Government can leverage their expertise and R&amp;D in the key technology.  

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). FFRDCs are also considered depending upon the task.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The EWSE projects will be measured by the number of technical studies performed with associated systems engineering artifacts (market research reports, technology assessments, solutions analyses, etc.) that are developed to support DODIN capabilities; and the number of proof-of-concept demonstrations or pilots executed to support viability of the technical approach/recommendation. These products will be coordinated with the stakeholders, users and/or Program Management Offices (PMO) to ensure EWSE provides the right deliverables for solution development decisions.  

FY 2017 planned target: Will complete 2 technical studies, 6 engineering artifacts, and 2 concept demonstrations. FY 2017 target met: Completed 2 technical studies, 6 engineering artifacts, and 2 concept demonstrations.
FY 2018 planned target: Will complete 2 technical studies, 6 engineering artifacts, and 2 concept demonstrations.
FY 2019 planned target: Will complete 2 technical studies, 6 engineering artifacts, and 2 concept demonstrations.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Information Network (DODIN) Systems Engineering and Support project aligns with the updated DISA Strategic Plan, which includes the Chief Technology Officer’s Outlook and a Technology Watchlist. The Watchlist identifies key technology areas that are essential for Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) including:  Process/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, and Communication (DoDIN, Mobile/End-User Devices).   
The DODIN Systems Engineering and Support Project ensure the technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and the latest Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO) Capabilities Planning Guidance (CPG) through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These strategies will establish the foundation for DISA's technology investments and technical development. The OCTO leverages emerging technology to drive efficiencies and cost savings to the DoD, the Warfighter, and other Federal Agencies, and provides actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.
Cyber security and cloud computing present critical near term challenges, especially the ability to securely leverage commercial cloud service offerings. The OCTO’s partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions. Included are applications with a security wrapper that detect and mitigate cyberattacks; smart routing and managed reputation capability; embedded system defense capabilities; and resilient and intrusion-tolerant network capabilities.
Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services. The OCTO will conduct technology assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DODIN architecture and standards. Enabled by the Technology Assessment Framework (TAF) and the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR), the OCTO will perform “quick looks” and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies. These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities; physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service APIs and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services; analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products; advanced approaches to Continuity of Operations (COOP) in a hybrid cloud environment; and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Enabled by the TAF and the Defense Technical Intelligence Report (DTIR), the OCTO will perform “quick looks” and deeper technology evaluations to provide critical awareness, characterization, and suitability of specific technologies.  These include the assessments of advanced cloud management capabilities, physical containers to enable mobile data center; emerging open source Storage Service APIs and/or abstractions and global standards for storage services, analytic platform performance baselines of emerging commercial analytic platform products, advanced approaches to COOP in a hybrid cloud environment, and the next generation software defined networks for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.

Will assess and transition technologically relevant and mature solutions, provides smart routing and managed reputation capabilities; Software Symbiotes which provides embedded system defense capabilities; and advanced technologies and protocols that provide resilient and intrustion-tolerant network and messaging capabilities.  

Will produce requisite cyber measures and ensure optimal use of commercial cloud services through Partnerships with industry, academia, and the Federal sectors. 

The increase of +$9.811 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is primarily attributable to the discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technology needed to support the development and adoption of key technological solutions, the realignment of civilian Full-Time-Equivalents (FTEs) and the associated payroll from PE0604764K to promote centralized, coordinated technology policy, direction, standards, and leadership allowing CTO and DISA the ability to influence and promote technology innovation that meets future DoD requirements.  In addition, CTO will perform assessment and reconnaissance of emerging technologies.</r2:Text>

There is a increase of +$1.771 from FY 2017 to FY 2018.  Funding will be used to morph to an internet 2.0 environment where DoD, other government organizations, coalition members, first responders, private industry, academia and commercial vendors will be able to share secured data and information in such a way that adversaries can be identified, found, brought to Justice before inflicting harm on innocent citizens and allies anywhere in the world.  CTO will aggressively pursue next generation technologies to feed the internet 2.0 environment.  These technologies will be leveraged through the expansion of a CTO futuristic Skunk Works effort known as Software Defined Everything (SDE) which is based on the notion of using software to keep redefining itself, rather than being locked into operating in a specific way.  It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler for the internet 2.0 environment. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.276 is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Federal Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Number of Technology Assessments 

Performance is measured by the number of technologies assessed and the technologies transitioned or presented to DISA decision-making bodies such as the Service Portfolio Council (SPC) for acquisition decisions.  The assessments identify, promote, channel and align technology research and investments.  The objectives are to satisfy warfighter requirements by addressing capability gaps, to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, and to reduce the time needed to field emerging technologies.   

Measure/Goal:   Number of technology assessments instantiated within the CTO Technology Environment.  Number of research initiatives designed, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned or presented to DISA decision-making bodies such as the SPC for acquisition decisions.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Networking capabilities and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.

PNVC:  The PVNC provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military, satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The decrease of -$25.050 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is primarily attributed to the one time increase in FY 2016 to complete the airborne variants of the PNVC baseband equipment. The original environmental requirements for the PNVC baseband equipment were changed in FY14 and the original designs were deemed suitable only for ground locations. This necessitated the creation of airborne variants of the baseband equipment to meet the more stringent aircraft requirements of the E-4B and E-6B platforms. The funding for the Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to develop the airborne versions came in two increments: an FY15 reprogramming and in FY16 to complete the development.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>PNVC project metrics track the development status of program acquisition documents, as required by the component executive. These documents include:  Project Execution Plan, Concept of Operations Acquisition Strategy, Capability Production Document, System Engineering Plan and other documents required by the DISA’s Component Acquisition Executive.  Additionally, for management and system engineering support vendors, monthly reports are critical to tracking overall programmatic and engineering progress and the percent of total deliverables received on time.

For product development activities, effective progress is measured based upon the task order milestones in the form of development reviews and weekly progress meetings.  As end items (hardware and software) become available for test, additional measures will be available.  Specifically, the percentage of successfully verified requirements out of the number tested and the number of critical trouble reports outstanding longer than six months, will be tracked.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DISN Systems Engineering Support project encompasses four activities:

Next Generation Networking Technologies (formally known as Internet Protocol (IP) and Optical Transport Technology Refresh):  Provides engineering technical expertise to support and integrate newer, more efficient technologies required to replace end of lifecycle equipment and to achieve more efficient Networking technologies.  These new technologies provide protected and assured services for critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.

Element Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).

Peripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  

DoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Engineer with plans and procedures, systems analysis, operational assessments, systems engineering, and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the mission of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Systems Engineer to the Joint Staff and Executive Leadership. It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provide the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The decrease of +$1.942 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to reduced number of technical assessments required, expansion of the production of architectural artifacts required to complete the NLCC Technical Architecture; development of a NLCC Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability; support engineering and implementation of the NLCC enterprise mobility infrastructure. Part of the overall increase (-$0.297) is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by compliance with contract deliverables schedules for specifically included products, such as: operational assessment plans, operational assessment reports; recommended revisions to the Joint Staff’s Emergency Action Procedures (EAP-CJCS) Volumes VI and VII; updates to NC3 System Description documents and Nuclear C3 Architecture Diagrams. In addition, performance of the NC3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element. These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management. Performance of the SLC3S-Airborne fleet is measured by the technical assessment results documented in the assessment reports. Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff and the DoD CIO to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.

Specific performance metrics include the following:

Provide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.			
			
Conduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.			
			
MEECN achieved all its FY 2017 performance metrics and is on track to achieve the FY 2018 and FY 2019 targets of provisioning the Joint Staff requirements within the allocated resources 90% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) mission focuses on developing Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise solutions to Combatant Commands, Services, and Defense-wide agencies to ensure critical mission execution in the face of cyber attacks.  The ISSP ensures that, the network, the computing centers, and core enterprise services will evolve to better support a joint cybersecurity/information assurance model that has common enterprise-scale perimeter defenses and will support a broad range of sharing policies from completely unclassified to tightly-held within a classified community.  The ISSP will test and develop active-active defensive capabilities; test and integrate software defined networking and orchestration closed-loop security; perform research, development and engineering of emerging cyber situational awareness technologies; harden the network by providing architecture support, systems engineering and analytical functions for Endpoint and Perimeter defense capabilities; cyber IT infrastructure and automation support to deploy enterprise-wide next generation identity technologies; and develop and evolve an integrated cyber domain security workforce to be on the leading edge of defensive capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

The GCCS-J Program is the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint C2 system of record.  It incorporates core planning and assessment tools required by Combatant Commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs. It provides support for commanders and staffs as they conduct joint and multinational operations by providing a fused picture of the battle space within an integrated system that is supporting joint warfighter needs today.  GCCS-J is currently focused on sustainment, synchronization, and modernization to meet emerging operational needs by modifying and enhancing elements or capabilities in order to implement new requirements, enhance functionality, increase efficiency and lower operating and deployment costs while taking advantage of the progress made by current operational systems and technologies.  The GCCS-J program is also executing incremental modernization of C2 capabilities using the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved needs.

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment. One of the key capabilities residing within the JPES portfolio of sustaining the existing Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) while modernization of JOPES is planned and implemented.  The JPES portfolio also includes a core set of infrastructure services consisting of  the JPES Framework (JFW) and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection (JFP), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM) and eventually the capabilities that will replace JOPES.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease of -$3.000 in FY 2017 is due to delayed development of modernized JPES velocity of JPES solution and JFW impacting schedule for analysis and solution development for obsolete software. 

The decrease of -$1.608 in FY 2019 is due to a reduction of operational capabilities requested by the user community and to sunset the previous version 4.3 in FY 2019/2020. The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by -$1.189 to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.

  •  Continue to decompose applicable existing applications into services
  •  Limit local deployment and move as much to the enterprise as possible
  •  Continue to expose data and scale services to support an enterprise implementation
  •  Continue to evolve more economical hardware and software architecture without impact to the operational user or Family of Systems (FoS)/interface partners
  •  Reduce overall sustainment cost through use of more cost effective and appropriate Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Hardware (HW) products
  •  Evolve to use of agile development practices
  •  Consolidation of clients and tools</r2:Description>

These updates will support the Joint C2 Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) goals of reducing cost, providing additional capability to the warfighter and sustaining existing C2 capabilities. Planned activities include award of a Development and Modernization contract that will focus on transitioning the GCCS-J to an open standards architecture deployable in a variety of operational environments (i.e. local, cloud, mobile, etc).  This effort will include development of GCCS-J capabilities to enhance functionality, implement new requirements, increase efficiency, and lower operating and deployment costs through the employment of new and emerging technologies.  

The decrease of -$0.975 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is the result of a reduction in performance benchmarking, information and knowledge engineering, custom application development, and product integration supporting GCCS-J Block V 6.0 development as it transitions into sustainment.</r2:Text>

The databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The JSC provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment (EME). Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts.
 
Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>DSO has the responsibility to investigate emerging spectrum related technologies and evaluate their applicability to improve future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation. The goal of the EST program is to identify the opportunities and risks associated with emerging spectrum-related technologies in the early stages of the technology development, influence and lead technology development in order to maximize DoD spectrum utilization, and ensure that spectrum policies incorporate optimal technology to meet DoD mission requirements. Within EST there is an increased focus on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). DSA is realized through wireless networking architectures and technologies that enable wireless devices to dynamically adapt their spectrum access according to criteria such as policy constraints, spectrum availability, propagation environment, and application performance requirements.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Information Environment (JIE) construct is a consolidated secure and defensible environment across DoD.  This is comprised of unified, consolidated and shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and standardized security architectures throughout the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.  

The target objective state of JIE is a DODIN that optimizes the use of DoD's IT assets from the administrative and operational planning at the Pentagon to the tactical edge; to include our mission partners through converging communications, computing, enterprise services, and defense of the DODIN that can be leveraged for all Department missions. 

When implemented, JIE will reduce DoD's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improved security by reducing the attack surface of our networks, and enable Combatant Commands/Services/Agencies (CC/S/A) to more efficiently access information to perform their missions from any authorized IT device, any time, from anywhere in the world.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a joint DoD security architecture deployed regionally throughout the world. Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites/infrastructure.  The savings are realized by coupling the JRSS and JMS. The JRSS collapses replicated IT security functionality for all Department of Defense (DoD) components into relatively few regionally located stacks.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The decrease of -$25.000 from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the completion of initial advanced development capabilities and the planned transition to sustainment of initial capabilities delivered in FY 2017.  Advanced development capabilities prototyped in FY 2017 included (not limited to): Case Management, Imaging, Workflow Management, Virtual System Access, Automated Records Check, and E-Application. These advanced capabilities will reduce overall program and technical risk with respect to delivery of the new National Background Investigation System.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible. The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2018.

Generation 1/2 Metric:

Percentage of system changes resulting in interoperability certification

Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual, operationally-relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Development of and improvements to instrumentation for data collection and testing support on the DCGS network domains and enclaves for the DCGS PoRs, National Agencies and Coalition Partners continues; with the number of active DDTE nodes expected to increase as the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) participate in assessment venues with other DI2E entities. Developing and implementing passive instrumentation on operational networks that can gather data on capabilities not instantiated on the DDTE test domain to provide a more robust evaluation of the net-centric maturity of the DCGS Enterprise. Data collected by these assessment efforts are reflected in the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and documented in an annual DCGS Enterprise Assessment Report.

The decrease of -$0.209 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to reduced testing costs following automation improvements, reduction in the number of testing events and delay in end of life hardware replacement.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The DCGS T&amp;E FT performs a minimum of six DCGS Enterprise assessments per year, and the results are consolidated into the T&amp;E FT Enterprise Assessment Report annually.  The T&amp;E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time.

The T&amp;E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity. In FY 2016, T&amp;E FT performed twelve (12) DCGS Enterprise assessments.  This trend is expected to continue in FY2017. Of the six DCGS PoR systems, two hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, &amp; Computers/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases. One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending. Of the three remaining PoRs, two are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&amp;E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events. Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&amp;E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.

In FY 2017, T&amp;E FT performed a minimum of ten (10) DCGS Enterprise assessments.

In FY 2018,  T&amp;E FT will perform a minimum of nine (9) DCGS Enterprise assessments.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.  The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of SATCOM capabilities at selected DoD SATCOM gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.

DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.

Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provide enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Teleport program executes its own test events to achieve this integrated approach, but will partner with each phase’s respective program office generated test activities to leverage the data needed to satisfy Teleport program test objectives. An approach summary for Teleport Gen 1/2 follows:

The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support. The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews. The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Teleport Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics:

Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data. Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost. Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Teleport Program Metrics:

RDT&amp;E funds will be used to maintain an interoperability certification of the fielded DoD Teleport system in light of required/desired system changes. These changes are certified in standalone test events or as part of DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE). Percentage will be computed by dividing the number of changes under test by the number deemed DoD Interoperable.

Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology. Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2018.

Generation 1/2 Metric:

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program funds the advanced technology development needed to achieve a responsive, efficient domestic industrial base that affordably meets the warfighters’ needs in a timely manner.  The ManTech program works with DLA’s diverse supply chains to improve manufacturing capability throughout a product's life cycle.  It provides the crucial link between invention and application by maturing, scaling up, and validating advanced manufacturing technology in “real world” environments.  ManTech developments provide a path to low-risk technology implementation for the many small businesses and defense unique suppliers as well as depots and shipyards that are critical to DLA.  By anticipating and addressing production and sustainment problems before they occur, readiness levels increase and sustainment costs are lower.  

DLA ManTech is aligned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  

• The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA has supply chain focused execution portfolios for food (Subsistence Network Procurement), Castings (Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology), Forgings (Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology), Batteries (Battery Network) and Additive Manufacturing.

• Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements without relying on foreign sources for microcircuits and critical strategic materials.  This strategic focus area mitigates supply issues caused by the lack of a reliable domestic manufacturing capability to produce products or raw materials needed to build and maintain weapon systems.  The major focus of the program is maintaining a reliable, trusted, domestic source for “non-procurable” linear and digital microcircuits.  Microcircuit emulation allows the Services to save significant costs by using form, fit and functionally equivalent spare parts rather than redesigning the next-higher-assembly.

• The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA, the Military Services, DLA industry partners and DLA customers. It includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) programs.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected up and down the supply chain and across all DLA Customers and suppliers.  A major focus is to transform DoD engineering data from two-dimensional paper-based products to three-dimensional computer based models, and to develop processes to move from “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF files) to technical data files that can interface directly with industries’ engineering systems. The benefits include shorter product introduction cycles, lower set up-costs for parts production and more economical small batch production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes Strategic Focus Area (SFA) is an R&amp;D effort undertaken with DLA’s suppliers to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of production lead-times, assure DLA managed products meet performance requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs. This SFA includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings/Forging programs and Additive Manufacturing programs. 

The Battery Network (BATTNET) objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. BATTNET conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for specific groups of batteries. BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of Service approved batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) Program is the successor to the Combat Rations Network R&amp;D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program's expanded areas of interest include: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. Desired outcomes include: reduced cost, increased efficiencies, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.

The Casting program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic casting industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD). Castings works with industry, universities, and the Casting Industry Associations to identify projects to improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation’s foundry industry. The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas within the DLA and DoD.   Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are castings. This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented, usually in conjunction with the industry associations. These advancements improve the metal casting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter. We will  invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forging program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic forging industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency. Working with industry, universities, and the Forging Industry Association to identify projects to improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation’s forging industry. The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas within the DLA and DoD.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs). Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Number (NSN) Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are forgings. This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations. These advancements improve the forging supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will  invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DoD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits. DLA is pursing all AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.  The AM effort pursues alternate means of supply for products that are otherwise non-procurable or susceptible to procurement issues due to an unresponsive manufacturing vendor base. The AM effort includes the identification of AM candidates among the population of products that are needed but hard to obtain, costly or have long manufacturing lead times. The AM effort requires management of 3D digital technical and manufacturing data. In addition, the AM effort includes the development of the processes that will tie the designers, engineers, maintainers, logisticians, procurement managers and the vendor base into a seamless AM procurement stream. Potential benefits include products that can address an unfulfilled Warfighter readiness need by reducing production lead times, production costs, storage costs, transportation costs and in some cases fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. DLA R&amp;D will leverage these efforts with Industry, Academia and ongoing Military Service-level agreements (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Department of Energy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DLA will work STPs with the community of practice partners of the military services, industry and academia.  SUBNET plans to improve process capabilities by identifying targets for product, automation and business operation changes, and implementing solutions in the Subsistence Supply Chain to produce such improvements as shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead cost, and improved quality. The STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as return on investment where applicable to ensure that all SUBNET STPs are fully documented, all projects have the potential for implementation in industry; and all projects address a specific DoD/DLA need.  

The Castings program will receive a significant increase in funding starting in FY17 to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR 17 process. Projects identified will investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter.  Contracts will be competitively awarded in FY17.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success.

The Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.

The Battery Network funding will be applied to pursue additional projects including production readiness of lithium conformable soldier batteries, military ground vehicle batteries, and aviation batteries; manufacturing transition of legacy and obsolete lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries to advanced lithium-ion batteries; and battery manufacturing automation and optimization technologies. These projects will address pressing supply chain issues by migrating from declining manufacturing to a high growth industrial base, and will achieve cost reduction by optimizing the manufacturing design, assembly, and test processes.

The Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.

FY 16 – FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Maintaining Viable Supply Sources SFA are projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently. Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics (MAE) program. 

The MAE Roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC. The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits. Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern. These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond. Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE will begin a major new thrust in emulation to address Linear Microcircuits in addition to its traditional focus on Digital.  Several efforts will address basic design, manufacturing, electrical test and quality/reliability requirements for establishing a basis for product-oriented developments across the FYDP. MAE will also complete development and transition Advanced Schottky TTL Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also continue development of additional emulation capabilities including TTL-Compatible CMOS. MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of a 1 million gate Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and 512K Read-Only and Random-Access Memory Emulation Capabilities. It will complete prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.

Strategic Materials: A request for white paper proposals was recently added to DLA’s Emerging R&amp;D Requirements BAA for critical initial manufacturing technology requirements in domestic high strength carbon fibers.  Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.  Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST), the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR), and the Emergent Manufacturing Technology (EMT) portfolios within its scope. 

The MUST Program focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations for DoD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end-to-end supply chain.

The DLIR program researches core technology to improve the quality, speed, and interoperability of logistics data. DLA must transform business practices and methodologies as the data for weapons systems evolves from traditional formats and delivery methods (such as two-dimensional images and PDF formats) to newer, more innovative methods (such as three-dimensional solid models, object-oriented databases, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 3C standards). This fundamental shift for DLA is driven by the Model-Based Enterprise approach, which is influencing the way industry is delivering design and development data for weapon systems to the Military Services and the way the Military Services in turn manage and provide the data to DLA. DLA Logistics Operations, DLA Acquisition, DLA Tech/Quality, and the Defense Standardization Program Office (DSPO) are key stakeholders in the DLIR initiatives to modernize the representation and delivery of weapons systems data. The DLIR program researches and demonstrates the use of innovative technologies to streamline DLA operations; current thrusts include development of logistics data interoperability and availability, and research into the transformation of DLA data repositories to a digitally linked, model-based enterprise. 

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.

The EMT program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This approach will be based upon open standards to improve publishability of documents and to ensure broad industry adoption.  LITE will enable improved interoperability between DOD internal and external data sources.  

MUST plans to conduct test and validation pilots, process reengineering to provide complete Function Requirement Document (FRD) for transition.  The focus will be the Product Test Center (PTC) industry reporting module, the TexSpec conversion for Spec Change Management, the Supply Request Package (SRP) process reengineering and the Shade Instrument Large Scale Pilot.  Schedule for Implementations with complete FRDs will start in FY19.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate – including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&amp;D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Logistics R&amp;D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. 

The DLA Log R&amp;D program is organized into three SFAs:
•Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support: R&amp;D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  
•Improving Logistics Processes: R&amp;D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.
•Emergent Logistics R&amp;D Requirements: R&amp;D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&amp;D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  The SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. 

This strategic focus area has 2 thrusts: Technical/Quality (T/Q) Process Improvements and Selected Process Improvements.

T/Q Process Improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters. Services have engineering responsibility for most Class IX parts. Many T/Q sub-processes involve interactions with Service engineering functions, which often are time-consuming and costly. Other key T/Q sub-processes are essential to the procurement function, such as analysis of parts content, source capabilities and problem resolution.

Selected Process Improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical/Quality (T/Q) function. Although all DLA processes are in scope, the focus for FY 2019 is on the Procurement process, especially aspects driving internal costs and delays in awards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

T/Q efforts will include transition of the Cost of Quality in Procurement and Agile Logistics for Acquisition and Regulated Materials Projects initiated in FY 15 and FY16, respectively.  In addition, a new effort will begin in developing methods to guard against malicious code entering the supply system through acquired items.  Additional new projects will be awarded as a result of collaborative planning efforts during FY16.  Collaborative efforts will be continued with the Procurement and T/Q Process Owners and their teams to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards.

This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs.  In the past DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times.  Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs.

Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials. Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification. Funding will be reallocated based on project requirements and reclassified into the Strategic Material Thrust.

Energy Readiness will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers.</r2:Text>

                                                            <r2:Text>SCM will continue to address the emerging technology opportunities that occur out of the budget cycle. This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs. In the past DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times. Saving the lead-time allows the agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs. The Program will initiate the Advanced Thermoelectric Technology project to improve the current thermoelectric heater technology so it is more fuel-efficient, has an increased heating range, reduced maintenance requirements, and a longer service life. The Advanced Thermoelectric Heater will replace the existing Space Heater Convective standard heaters currently stocked at DLA, and will provide DoD a single, versatile heater that reduces the logistics footprint and satisfies the space heating requirements of expeditionary forces. Additionally, SCM will support DLA Strategic Materials with one or more cost saving opportunities that exist for DLA via recycling and recovery initiatives.

In FY18, the AM project will be funded under PE 0603680S / Manufacturing Technology Program (ManTech) Project 7 - Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (formerly Material Availability). This realignment will maintain continuity of funding and activity for this program.

ERP will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers.</r2:Text>

Strategic Materials:  Program will address supply chain risks in Strategic and Critical Materials as needed to include qualifying alternate materials and sources, recycling or reclaiming strategic materials, and developing new manufacturing processes for strategic materials. Artificial Intelligence technologies applicable to logistics operations will be investigated and, where appropriate, prototyped. Applications for  Block Chain technologies will be investigated and prototyped in the SCM SFA.  

ERP will focus on determining R&amp;D solutions for ongoing issues affecting fuel and fuel additive quality and operational requirements (e.g. thermal stability, storage stability, ignition capability).  The program will continue to assist the military services in the qualification and certification of alternative fuels to meet military specification requirements; this will be parallel to the availability of military resources necessary to complete these efforts. The ERP program will investigate and prototype, as appropriate, drone technologies applied to the energy operations.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Prior Years includes:
-Capabilities Based Logistics: $7.342M. The Department requires procedures and technologies which provide enterprise-level capabilities critical to the distribution system to improve performance of the end-to-end DOD supply chain in direct support of the full range of military operations.  Ability to rapidly respond to customers’ changing demands, with a reliably high level of service.  These needs include: capabilities which enhance any supply or transportation mission (aeromedical, air refueling, joint logistics over-the-shore, and seabasing); analysis, tailoring and implementation of selected best enterprise-level practices from industry; and tools/procedures to optimize transportation plus supply (distribution) plans and schedules in support of an entire operation.  This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of capability-based logistics.

-Deployment and Distribution Velocity Management: $6.869M. DOD requires procedures/technologies targeted at optimizing throughput at the nodes and through the conduits of the deployment and distribution supply chains, from origin to point of use and return to include: inventory management enhancers (includes node cargo management/tracking); materiel handling innovations (including methods of reducing handling); improved physical access to nodes (includes aircraft all-weather visual systems); port throughput enhancements (includes in-port time reduction methods); and innovative delivery methods (for example, precision airlift, autonomous re-supply).  This project addresses required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers of DOD’s distribution and transportation systems in the area of deployment/distribution velocity management.

-Cross Domain Intuitive Planning: $2.408M. Procedures/technologies which improve decision-making and collaboration within the supply chain, from the planning stage to real-time execution and retrograde operations, without need for highly specialized operators of the tools.  Projects in this area address following areas: decision support tools for any echelon of the supply chain or decision-maker, distribution process simulations and models for analysis and training, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring tools, on-line training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, recommended courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  This project will provide required mission support to combatant commanders and other distribution/transportation customers in the area of collaborative planning/execution/information sharing/decision support tools.

-End-to-End Visibility: $7.039M. Enhanced end-to-end visibility of all aspects of power projection/sustainment spectrum is required to improve the effectiveness/efficiency of deployment/distribution/redeployment operations to ensure warfighter support and confidence.  This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility, enhance planning/execution, and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process/system architecture which will integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DoD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Additionally need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DoD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.

-Distribution Planning and Forecasting: $8.504M. There is a lack of collaborative distribution planning, based on an understanding of aggregated customer requirements, for optimizing the end-to-end distribution process. Planning, forecasting and collaboration are insufficiently advanced to fully synchronize people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools should be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Project investigates the need for flexible end-to-end enhanced modeling and simulation and collaborative decision support tools.

-Joint Transportation Interface: $14.917M. Synchronizing strategic/theater delivery capabilities to meet increasingly dynamic customer needs.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.

-Distribution Protection/Safety/Security: $15.135M. The Theater Commander has not always been able to provide the appropriate security in a timely manner during deployment.  In some cases there are insufficient security assets to oversee convoy security in-country; therefore, all movement requirements are competing for the same limited resources.  Additionally need to explore new, portable methods of detecting hazardous/asymmetric materials in very small quantities to support safe logistics operations.  Also explore technologies to enhance the capability to deliver personnel/materiel to anti-access/austere airfields and seaports.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion to include drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities. Current planning/forecasting/collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems to include the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need. Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces. The ability to rapidly determine the impact of any delays/changes and conduct "what -if" impact assessments on the closure of force packages is required. This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department finds it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce low volume state-of-the-practice (SOTP) and legacy microelectronics that are unavailable from commercial foundries. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing a guaranteed and Trusted source of supply of microelectronics parts that are essential to combat operations. In addition DMEA provides the rare technology capability to bridge the gap between research and application allowing DMEA to develop, manage and implement innovative microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. This unique research and engineering capability will be leveraged to develop low-volume, high mix fabrication processes for state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies that meet the Department’s performance and reliability needs.

This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. Trusted access to SOTA technologies remains a major challenge and therefore it is most important to develop a long term Trusted source for the Department. Threats to Defense Microelectronics include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments, and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned, extended combat use increases their attrition and increases the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities. 

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires low volume SOTP and legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. There is also the major challenge of the ability of Defense R&amp;D Programs to access Trusted SOTA technologies when developing new systems. Consequently, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. To meet these requirements, DMEA procures commercial licenses to organically produce semiconductor technologies that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and guaranteed source of these critical parts. This proven model can be extended to SOTA technologies by acquiring advanced commercial process Intellectual Property (IP) and implementing it in a copy exact approach.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication expertise to ensure that the Department can field systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA has established increased ties with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Combatant Commanders to understand their specific threats and opportunities that can be exploited by quicker, more resilient microelectronic solutions. This knowledge of varying requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions – along with its unique technical perspective – allows DMEA to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA has years of experience understanding the maturity of US and world microelectronics technology and knows what it takes to adapt the technology for the US warfighter. Based on the results of the knowledge DMEA acquires through technology forecasting, effective modeling/simulation, prototyping and experimentation, DMEA influences program requirements with recommended improvements and advancements. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool that can be leveraged by the entire US Government in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs. 

Working alongside industry, DMEA utilizes a business model that establishes a pathway that accelerates the delivery of superior semiconductor technologies. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now guaranteed to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. DMEA incorporates commercial technology, along with accelerated acquisition methods to accelerate delivery of needed capability. In this way, DMEA revolutionizes the way the Department leverages commercial technology by exploiting business-cycle opportunities to access these technologies. In this way, the government ensures perpetual access to this technology without bearing the high, upfront process development and qualification costs.

These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed IP and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production order. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence necessary to ensure them that their IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a weapon system operational, elevate its sophistication level, or to meet new threats. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. Extending this mission to include assured access to Trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies will more comprehensively ensure the integrity of microelectronics in all critical defense systems. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies with distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, guaranteed and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades to acquire IP and manufacturing capabilities of SOTA technologies via the copy exact model, as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, and the incorporation of the process technologies that are necessary to anticipate the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands. 

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and are required to remain in service beyond planned replacement schedules, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing many systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered National Critical Assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department, other agencies, and the intelligence community require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DoDI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid altered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities available to be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies. Commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies, and is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, along with most other key defense technologies, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement often translates into significant force multipliers and capability advantages. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors. 

The Trusted Foundry program provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. DMEA will foster all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, access to Trusted Microelectronics is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Prior Year includes:
-Business Enterprise Information Services (BEIS): $13.360M. The BEIS utilized the mature, existing infrastructure of Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW), Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), and Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) to provide timely, accurate, and reliable business information from across the DoD to support auditable financial statements as well as provide detailed information visibility for management in support of the Warfighter.  The goals of BEIS were to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports/statements based on standardized data.  

-Defense Information System for Security (DISS): $70.319M. The DISS program was a family of systems solution that specifically addresses the security clearance and suitability determinations requirements of Section 3001 of Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) which requires 90% of all clearances – whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential – to be completed within 60 days, as well as supports Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) compliance across the DoD.  The DISS electronically collects, reviews, and shares relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRPTA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and GAO recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce.  

-Defense Travel System (DTS): $1.423M. The DTS program was a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end financial management system that automates temporary duty travel for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.

-Defense Retired and Annuitant Pay System (DRAS): $15.010M. The DRAS program established and maintained a modernized retired military pay accounts.  DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process. Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place. 

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems. Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents. The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions. This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous. 

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow. Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data. Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment. The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness. Currently, Defense Agencies use several different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision-making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.

The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision-making. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.

The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.5 (R12). DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards. The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).

DAI supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”. DAI is also aligned to the DOD Agency Strategic Fiscal Years 2015-2018, Goal 5: Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, Key Strategic Initiative - Improving competitiveness through accountability and efficiency and SO 5.2: Improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness. The objective of the DAI system is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data.

The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay (P2P); Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash. Release (Rel) 1 provided an application upgrade to Oracle R12 along with (P2P) enhancements facilitating SFIS/SLOA compliance and automated Time and Labor absence management. Rel 2 introduced Grants Financial Management accounting and the start of a phased implementation of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) capabilities. Future capabilities will support Rel 3 Direct Treasury Disbursing and Budget Formulation as well as Rel 4 Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).

DAI is currently implemented at 22 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) and supports over 39,322 users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) assertion packages.  In 2017, the system received an unqualified SSAE 18 report.

The benefits of DAI are:
• Common business processes and Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS, SLOA, Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Procurement Request Data Standard (PRDS));
• Access to real-time financial data transactions;
• Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
• Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; and
• Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.

The DAI PMO completed the Oracle R12 application upgrade. The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support. 

DLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager, and PMO staff. The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing. The DAI PMO serves as systems integrator. Contracted subject matter experts configure COTS to provide compliant business processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) of September 23, 2013, the MDA placed DAI Increment 1 in sustainment. Increment 2 addressed the Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) application upgrade. The upgrade was completed (January 2015); therefore, Increment 2 Rel 1 subsumed Increment 1 for all users. A new ADM in June 2017 introduced Increment 3.  When Increment 3, Rel 1 goes live, it will subsume Increment 2; therefore, only one DAI production baseline exists at any point in time.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Functionality: Financial system performance. PEO will determine substantial compliance with the annual Investment Review of PMO assertion of compliance with the latest version of the Department’s BEA in scope requirements for Defense Financial Management Improvement Guidance (DFMIG) and other laws regulations and policy. Objective: Substantial compliance.

Program Conformance to BEA Processes, Data Standards, and Business Rules. The PEO will determine substantial compliance with the annual Investment Review of PMO assertion of compliance with the latest version of the Department’s BEA. Objective: Substantial compliance.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers.  It requires supply chain excellence.  Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit innovative research and development proposals from the small business community to address DLA’s strategic and operational requirements.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve some technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and provide a strong business case for Phase II investment for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration.  A favorable return on investment and commercialization potential have a strong influence on Phase II selections.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future DLA operational and sustainment requirements.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

The DLA's SBIR/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within several DLA Elements:

2.  Commercialization:  The Congressional language defines “Commercialization,” which is clarified by the Office of Secretary of Defense Office of Small Business Programs (OSD/OSBP) Re-Authorization Policy Directive:
- (Investment) The process of developing products, processes, technologies, or services; and/or 
- (Sales) The production and delivery (whether by the originating party or by others) of products, processes, technologies, or services for sale to or use by the Federal Government or commercial markets    

The Small Business Administration and OSD/OSBP assign a Commercialization Index based on progression within the Phases and reported successes</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Industrial Preparedness Manufacturing Technology (IP ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters’ needs throughout the defense system life cycle. IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions. The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards. It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur. 

Beginning in FY16, DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information. 

• The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in Subsistence Network (formerly known as the Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing. 
• Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts. In the future, it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. 
• The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly known as Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S. A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected. 

NOTE: The single supply chain exhibits were removed as they are now included within the SFA exhibits.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In 2015, DLA R&amp;D expanded the Combat Rations Network (CORANET) program to include the “Subsistence Supply Chain (SUBNET),” which consists of the supply chain for military subsistence, including combat rations, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and “market fresh."  The goal of the SUBNET program is to maximize the capability and the capacity to produce and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies.  

-Customer Driven Uniform Manufacture (CDUM): $18.499M. This project was realigned to SFA Improving Technical and Logistics Information. The CDUM program concluded in October 2014, and the results have been implemented DOD wide for recruit items. Residual CDUM projects have been transitioned into the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) Program. The MUST Program was initiated in 4th quarter 2014. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

-Procurement Readiness Optimization - Advanced System Technology (PRO-ACT): $12.409M. This project was realigned to SFA Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes. The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metal casting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems. The increase in funding will help develop new technology for casting suppliers, including inspection, materials, modeling, and design.

-Procurement Readiness Optimization - Forging Advanced System Technology (PRO-FAST): $5.627M. This project was realigned to SFA Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes. The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed, these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.  The increase in funding will help develop new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and most expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die).

-Material Acquisition Electronics (MAE): $58.396M. This project was realigned to SFA Maintaining Viable Supply Sources. The MAE program develops a capability to emulate most obsolete digital integrated circuits (ICs) in the Federal catalog using a single, flexible manufacturing line.  DoD has estimated $2.9 billion is spent every five years redesigning circuit card assemblies.  Many of these circuit card redesigns are performed to mitigate IC obsolescence.  Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices.

-Battery Network (BATTNET): $8.312M. This project was realigned to SFA Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes. The BATTNET program is focused on improving the supply and reducing the cost of procured batteries used in fielded weapon systems such as communication radios and armored vehicles. Batteries exhibit dynamic challenges for military logistics. BATTNET is a community of practice of battery supply chain members, engineering support activities, researchers, and users. BATTNET conducts R&amp;D to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries.  For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) are R&amp;D efforts undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times, assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  

This SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Subsistence Network, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The Subsistence Supply Chain consists of military subsistence, which includes combat rations, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and market fresh products. The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is a manufacturing technology program and is the successor to the Combat Rations R&amp;D program. SUBNET’s community of practice will research and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. The desired outcomes of the current short-term projects Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate, Optimize Combat Ration Inspection Costs, and Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project  include testing of low risk, high-impact technology and process improvements that will improve the quality of individual and group combat rations, reduce cost, and provide efficiencies, then transitioning these improvements to industrial base suppliers and government suppliers.   

The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Quality Sources SFA are projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently.  Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  

The Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.

The MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

The DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

USD(AT&amp;L) will provide acquisition oversight authority for the program.

The PDC has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)in October 2011.

 The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

The budgeted projects will provide enhancements to the existing capability, ensure efficient operability, and provide solutions for process gaps as they are discovered.  The greater enhancements to DPAS allow the DoD to sunset legacy systems; DPAS assimilates the legacy functionality into the overall operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The current Work Order/Ticket tracking capability in DPAS is rather generic and causes inefficiencies for both Vehicle Managers and IT Managers.  DPAS will create a Work Order process that is more streamlined and targeted to these asset types.  This will be done in one of two methods, depending on which solution will result in less maintenance cost in future years.  The first method would be a process that changes the fields displayed and data values in drop down lists depending on the asset type.  The second method would be to develop separate processes for the asset types.  DPAS will conduct user meetings in FY18 to determine the full scope of the requirements and develop the capabilities in FY19.

DPAS will continue to provide support for the Financial Audit.  The Department will have completed the first full audit and have findings that must be addressed.  DPAS will work with each Service or Agency to determine the areas that DPAS can increase capability to permit the findings to be closed.  At this time it is difficult to specifically state what these capabilities may be but DPAS is used by all components of the Department so there are sure to be areas that DPAS can implement capabilities to permit the Components to address the findings</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Partner Outreach and Collaboration Support (POCS) is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative. The goal of the program is to provide a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment – characterized by the capacity of Department of Defense (DoD) institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, Partnership for Peace (PfP) and international partners, and other DoD educational institutions and communities. GlobalNET currently supports over 80,000 users. The program uses spiral methodology to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.

The GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), the DSCA, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD(P)), North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners an unclassified secure platform to share information, communicate and collaborate globally 24/7, and supports administrative activities. It provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. POCS implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure, and provides allies and partner countries the ability to team in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program. The program supports PfP coalition Initiatives through the development of distributive collaboration tools to assist U.S./NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities. This support is important to achieve the interoperability/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force. POCS additionally supports internet-based education, collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The goal of the program is to provide a common information technology platform GlobalNET to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment – characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities. GlobalNET currently support over 80,000 users. The program uses spiral methodology to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The DSCA oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This includes expanding the hardware and software to an alternate site to allow additional users to access and use the system concurrently and be a backup site in the event of a disaster or failure. Because of all of the advanced graphics and expansion of the user base, it is expected that we will need this additional capacity and the best plan to distribute it out to an alternate location.</r2:Text>

The program uses an organizational approach to ensure sustainable, and updated technology and information sharing procedures. By partnering with other U.S. Government activities, existing assets are leveraged to preserve U.S. investments, avoid duplication of effort between activities, and offer economically prudent solutions to improve information sharing and achieve U.S. security cooperation goals. Independent Operational Test teams are brought on to ensure that GlobalNET bears independent validation of the development team’s effort.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>POCS development performance is measured in several methods: the successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting target dates in the project management plan; via a combination of statistics including the number of trouble tickets generated on the development site, operational user feedback on development site usability, and design; and the system’s performance during developmental and operational testing.  The use of a 3rd party to execute the operational test ensures that the system meets the performance metrics prior to moving to production.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) provides stakeholders of Department of Defense (DoD) Humanitarian Assistance (HA) programs, including embassy staff, the Combatant Commands (COCOMs), the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), and a broad range of DoD and interagency partners, the capability to manage, support, and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funded projects on a web-based map display, in addition to automating report generation, providing tools to coordinate with Interagency and partner nation stakeholders, and perform a variety of analyses.

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training, and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.5 system, which contains more than 16,000 active projects (7,000 of which have been completed) valued at more than $2.3 billion, with a community of over 6,000 users. The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, manage, and evaluate projects intended to assist the COCOMs in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nation’s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events. G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). 

G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.

G-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in four major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY2012-FY2020.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information System (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nation’s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events. G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs). It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states. The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and     releases that are developed and implemented over time. The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF).

G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability. The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states. G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc. This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities. To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments,
U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding.

G-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Info System (OHASIS), and Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems. G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology. Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in four major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY2012-FY2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

User stories and scenarios will be developed to support testing.  Design reviews and planning efforts of new capabilities will be very technical and required full understanding of requirements.  New capabilities will include the ability for conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), and Military Department (MILDEP) stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD Common Access Card (CAC)/ Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DOD agencies such as the Dept. of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user’s organization is easily shared and accessible.  Further improvements will be accomplished on the Cross-Domain Solution (CDS), which will allow the transfer of data/documents from Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) to the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet); the addition of four Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) which are a major component of G-TSCMIS data and reduce user re-entry resulting in a positive operational impact and higher quality of data -- i.e. completeness and accuracy; expansion of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which will facilitate dynamic creation and maintenance of access control policies, subject attributes, and resource attributes.

An increase of $6.589M from FY2017 to FY2018 is due to the required development contract award of the fourth release, Release 4.  New requirements resulted from the Joint Staff J6 Requirements Workshop in June 2015, National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 17 and NDAA 18 will added additional developmental efforts to future releases.  New capabilities will include the ability for assisting OSD Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development, conducting strategic-level analysis, assessment, and decision making by senior OSD Cost Assessment and Performance Evaluation (CAPE), JS, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), CJCS, and MILDEP stakeholders via the Strategic Visualization and Decision Support component; non-DoD CAC/ PKI Token Access which will support Inter-agency access from non-DoD agencies such as the Department of State; a document repository so all pertinent security cooperation documentation from each user’s organization is easily shared and accessible.

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>G-TSCMIS will follow the Rapid IT Acquisition approach as detailed in Section 804 of the 2010 NDAA. G-TSCMIS will initiate an evolutionary and iterative development process for a software-only solution using multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Build Decision in FY2012 and enter the IIDD phase. Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G- TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2, and fair and open competition for the Release 3 contract. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards. Release 4 will be completed by a separate contract which will be competed for under fair and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>G-TSCMIS performance is measured in several outcome-based methods. The JC2 Capability Definition Package produced by JS J6 defines the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) to be met. JS J6 also approved specific Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance (MOE/MOP), establishing thresholds and objectives for G-TSCMIS software to meet. Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program. The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational. Additional statistics-based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&amp;V and Developmental tests validate system performance.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Security Service manages the Enterprise Security System (ESS) to provide an effective, real-time, security support capability for the Military Departments, DoD Agencies, the NISP, and other Federal Agencies.  In compliance with the Expanded Electronic Government, President’s Management Agenda, and the DoD Enterprise Architecture Framework, ESS is the unified offering of security mission systems which facilitate and automate improved national investigative standards, streamline security processes, and increase DoD community collaboration.

The DSS Mission Information Technology (IT) systems provide critical service to the major DSS mission areas for Industrial Security Oversight and Security Education.  DSS performs this critical function through operation of its mission production systems to include the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), the DSS Gateway, and the Security Training Education and Professionalization Portal (STEPP).  RDT&amp;E for DSS mission systems primarily includes pre-planned product improvements to the applications, researching and improving assured information sharing to better posture systems and networks against vulnerabilities, ensuring self-defense of systems and networks, and safeguarding data at all stages for the DSS to increase efficiencies by providing web-based systems to manage certification and accreditation activities. These IT systems are as follows:   

Office of Designated Approving Authority (ODAA) Business Management System (OBMS).  The OBMS will automate the approval and certification process of cleared industry’s classified information processing security plans and operations.  This will increase mission efficiency by providing a web-based system to manage certification and accreditation activities, provide improved reporting capabilities to support DSS and industry through improved metrics, accreditation timeliness and accuracy and reduce the number of unaccredited systems by providing automated notifications to DSS and industry.  

EFCL:  The eFCL will be a centralized repository for information of facilities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). The eFCL will capture facility information relating to a cleared facility, from the initial processing of the facility clearance, the record decision pertaining to facility clearance request, to include Foreign Ownership Control or Influence (FOCI) information, as well as decommissioning the facility clearance, and capturing the DSS oversight activities.  The eFCL will provide a means for users to submit, update, search, and view facility verification requests.

Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  ISFD is the main DSS mission system that tracks and executes the National Industrial Security Program for DoD and 31 other Federal Executive Agencies of cleared industrial security facilities.  The ISFD provide users with a nationwide perspective on National Industrial Security Program related facilities, as well as, facilities under DSS oversight in the DoD conventional AA&amp;E program. ISFD provides source data for the DoD Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and the Facility Verification Request (FVR) application.

National Industrial Security System (NISS, formerly known as Field Operations System (FOS).  The NISS is slated as the next generation enterprise capability, replacing the Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD).  Additionally, NISS will provide seamless integration of other DSS systems and applications, such as eFCL, OBMS, DD-254, and Mobile Workforce Applications.  NISS will provide DSS with comprehensive enhanced capability to manage its entire mission portfolio.  NISS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data in the hands of field representatives for decision-making.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  

The National Contract Classification System (NCCS).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires a DD Form 254 be incorporated in each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and classification guidance necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required to perform on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation’s classified information is properly safeguarded.

National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) formerly known as Identity Management (IdM).  NCAISS is mandatory for compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program Management Office and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD-NII), Joint Task Force for Global Networks Operations (JTF-GNO) Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 06-02, CTO 07-015, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo 11-11 (M-11-11), directing accelerated use of PKI across the enterprise.  This initiative is designed to enable multiple DSS business systems to have service-accessibility that is controlled through PKI-compliant single sign-on authentication.  Potential expanded use of the NCAISS across the DSS enterprise to provide CAC-based authentication for business support applications to support the SIPRNet and JWICS domains, provide enhanced identity and access control analytics. It will also incorporate any remaining DSS operated application into the DSS NCAISS solution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Increment 2 will include a SIPR instance of NISS, a Cross-domain Solution, and add enhancements to Security Violations, Security Vulnerability Assessments, and Suspicious Contact Reports. Initiate Independent Verification and Verification (IV&amp;V) and Government Acceptance Testing (GAT) of Increment 2. IV&amp;V and GAT findings will be addressed. Initiate planning of NISS Increment 3.

2. NCCS. Continue scheduled enhancements through version releases and continued sustainment. Agile development approach; 2 release cycles per year. Future enhancements will address updates to the New DD254 Form. 

3. NCAISS. Continue integration and application sustainment activities.

4. eFCL. DSS will no longer use eFCL once capabilities have transitioned into NISS.

5. ISFD. DSS will retire ISFD once capabilities have transitioned into NISS.</r2:Text>

Initiate development of NISS Increment 3.  Increment 3 will include enhancements to KMP monitoring, NATO CPI, Triage Outreach Program, NISP Oversight Report, and Outgoing Foreign Visits.  Initiate Independent Verification and Verification (IV&amp;V) and Government Acceptance Testing (GAT) of Increment 2.  IV&amp;V and GAT findings will be addressed.
2.  NCCS.  Continue scheduled enhancements through version releases and continued sustainment.  Agile development approach will continue with 2 release cycles per year.  We will address any findings/bugs/issues encountered from Independent Verification and Verification (IV&amp;V) and Government Acceptance Testing (GAT).
3. NCAISS.  Final option year on current contract completed and NCAISS will be in full operational capability (FOC) sustainment.  Complete final transition activities for NCAISS over to Data Center Operations.  Long-term sustainment actions will then be assumed by ITSS contract support.  Continue integration and application sustainment costs, with some software upgrades. Address findings/bugs/issues encountered from Independent Verification and Verification (IV&amp;V) and Government Acceptance Testing (GAT) as needed.</r2:Text>

Increment 2 will require expanded licensing for Oracle OBIEE and licensing required from the company Software AG Government Solutions (SAGGS) which were not originally taken into consideration.  The application will also introduce new cost drivers such as Cross Domain Solution (CDS) and expanded MilCloud footprint as DSS moves forward to comply with the DoD mandate of Cloud-First.  NISS will be a driver for secondary/COOP utilization of MilCloud services.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                                                    <r2:Description>DITMAC will provide the Department's first truly quantitative and qualitative analytic overview of insider threat related risk trends, which will significantly inform future decision making.  The DITMAC follows an analytics-driven approach to assessing risk and endeavors to employ a rigorous science-driven approach to addressing risk and risk mitigation as it pertains to Insider Threat in the Department. Automating insider threat reporting, and aggregating data from throughout the DoD and federal government will potentially save lives and money through thwarting insider threats and leaks. Automation of integrated tools will offset increasing manpower needs. The system will also be available to the components for use, reducing the costs overall for new Insider Threat system development and sustainment throughout the DoD. 


FY 2017 Accomplishments:
Continued development of existing capabilities to better serve the insider threat community, while beginning the system re-architecture design to make the technical capabilities more flexible and adaptable, increasing communication/information sharing, decreasing cyber vulnerabilities, and cost savings each year in software licensing and technical support. Initial pilot deployment to 11 DoD Components for use as internal case management system.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Technical Information Center’s (DTIC) unique mission is to aggregate and fuse science and technology data to provide rapid, accurate, and reliable knowledge to researchers and developers of the next generation of technologies needed to assure our national security. DTIC, a DoD Field Activity, is the DoD’s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and industry-related information.  DTIC also operates DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs) focused on Defense Systems, Cyber Security and Information Systems, and Homeland Defense and Security.

Each year, DoD invests over $13.0 Billion in research, development and procurement of advanced technologies needed to defend our nation.  DTIC preserves the fruits of these costly labors for reuse across the enterprise.  As an efficient and cost-effective steward of technical information, DTIC collects data and provides answers to researchers seeking state-of-the-art data relevant to their projects.  Through this interchange of information DTIC accelerates innovation and prevents duplication of experiments, tests, and prototyping activities because researchers can build on what has been done or choose other paths if prior research resulted in a dead end. Using DTIC-created forums, researchers, Warfighters, and industry partners can also rapidly collaborate and connect across the DoD research and engineering (R&amp;E) enterprise.  Finally, DTIC provides a department-level map of R&amp;D activity.  This map gives decision-makers insight into current and past research, highlighting where progress is being made and by whom.  Through the preservation and sharing of the results of billions of dollars of past DoD investments, DTIC increases the return on past investments and accelerates current efforts, saving the Department precious time and dollars.  Through its collaboration tools and outreach to the R&amp;E community, DTIC connects researchers across the lab enterprise, to include researchers and engineers, Warfighters and DoD’s industry partners. 

DTIC’s strategic themes center on customer focus, innovation, operational excellence, and strategic partnering.  In support of these themes, DTIC’s organizational efforts are focused on the following priority areas:
1) Search:  Develop new algorithms that enable our users to quickly discover useful information and to ensure we present the most relevant information.  Expand and enhance our data collections to improve the quality and completeness of the data. 
2) Collaboration:  Provide collaboration platforms for the DoD science and technology community to work together on investments that efficiently deliver solutions to the Warfighter.
3) Access Identity:  Strengthen methods of user authentication through the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) tokens, biometrics and other methods to grant access to recognized, trusted and authorized users.  Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC’s stewardship (protect information access).
4) Data Fusion/Analysis:  Gather information from multiple data sources and provide knowledge products that fuse the disparate data sets into a single view of the life cycle of research.  Present an overarching picture of research investment that enables decision-makers to link multiple efforts with integrated capabilities (employ resources to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across Services).  
5) Cyber Security:  Continue to leverage state-of-the art technologies, processes and practices designed to protect DTIC networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.
6) Data Center Optimization/Cloud:  Migrate services to cloud providers to improve availability, redundancy, and mission flexibility; to reduce time to deliver new capabilities; to save costs; and to enhance cyber security.

DTIC recognizes the need to accomplish its mission while increasing the value of its services and products.  DTIC has reduced its headquarter staffing, physical footprint, civilian personnel and support contractors.  DTIC has restructured the IAC program, and continues to consolidate its data center.  

Recently, DTIC has taken on additional programs, to include its new role in leading the Department in efforts to provide public access to DoD-funded journal articles and research data and increase outreach to industry through DTIC’s Defense Innovation Marketplace.  In addition, DTIC is sponsoring the publication of a quarterly DoD R&amp;E Journal.  The purpose of the Journal is to share controlled unclassified and classified information throughout the R&amp;E community, reduce exfiltration of information, and to serve as a vehicle to recognize talented individuals in sensitive technology areas.  Moreover, DTIC activities promote citizen science.  Citizen science mobilizes the public to engage in the scientific process and thereby address real-world problems.  Citizen scientists identify research questions, collect and analyze data, interpret results, make new discoveries, develop technologies and applications, and solve complex problems.  DTIC continues to ensure its activities are efficient and effective, meet users’ expectations, and employ industry best practices and standards, while protecting its wealth of information from cyber threats. 

DTIC's restructured Information Analysis Centers (IACs) drive innovation and technological development by anticipating and responding to the information needs of the defense and broader community. The IAC Program Office provides core funding, management and oversight of three IACs, which are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields. The IAC multi-award task order contracts ensure that new research, analysis, and development builds on prior investments and puts to work the best practices of government, industry, and academia. The IAC approach was identified as a "best practice" by the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy in a January 2015 memo wherein he promoted maximum use of the IAC contracts across DoD.  The IACs are structured into three application areas:  Cyber Security and Information Systems, Homeland Defense and Security, and Defense Systems. As part of the Department's acquisition improvement initiatives, the IAC multi-award contracts enhance competition, increase usage of small businesses, and reduce costs. For the last several years, competition inherent in the IAC model has produced savings of 17-25 percent over projected costs, delivering vetted technical expertise to address many of the complex challenges DoD faces. An independent assessment by the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that the IACs improve affordability, productivity, and standardization within defense acquisition programs. Providing the acquisition enterprise access to thousands of industry subject matter experts, DTIC's IACs perform over $1.0 Billion of customer-funded research and prototyping annually.  The results of the work are a rich source of new material in DTIC's information asset collections and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies, e.g., Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security).

This Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations. DTIC focuses on three core mission areas (Collection, Dissemination and IACs) and purchases space and shared services (e.g., human resources (HR); financial management; contracting; IT security; communications; and civilian payroll services) from expert and efficient DoD providers.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DTIC is responsible for developing, coordinating and enabling a strong scientific and technical information (STINFO) program for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) and the DoD scientific &amp; technical (S&amp;T) enterprise. In this role, DTIC sets policy for scientific and technical information (STI) exchanges for the research and engineering (R&amp;E) community. DTIC’s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions to safeguard national security, export control, and intellectual property rights.

Recognizing the common elements across budget justification documents, progress reports, completed work reports, studies, and journal articles, DTIC is mapping relationships to enable users to access the life cycle of research projects from planning to final results. DTIC employs information technology to verify and validate information submitted and improve user confidence in DoD research documentation.

DTIC is leading the Department’s efforts to implement public access to published journal articles, and digital data from research funded by taxpayers. In this role, DTIC is actively working with partners across the Services, components, other federal agencies and publishers.  These ongoing efforts directly complement and support the Department’s objectives associated with Citizen Science.  Consistent with the Administration’s (Office of Management and Budget) emphasis for open standards and machine readable formats, DTIC initiated the transition from paper and Portable Document Format (PDF) based information to Web Service Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard data submission and machine readable delivery. DTIC partnered with the OSD Comptroller to collect investment account budget justification documentation in XML and embed this XML in PDF for justification books delivered to Congress. DTIC employed this same technology in collecting S&amp;T progress reports from the Services and Agencies, and Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) data from industry. DTIC is planning the migration of its completed technical reports collection to the same open standards, i.e., machine readable formats.  

Through the use of commercial search technology, DTIC provides search capability that links its knowledge of the DoD domain and metadata to support both text searches and data mining. DTIC continually works to enable additional features within our search capabilities and from commercial partners to improve information discovery and relevance.

DoD conducts science and technology research via the following means:  60+ labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), DTIC’s Information Analysis Centers (IACs), and other contracts and grants.  Spanning over a dozen distinct priority area communities of interest, the results of this work are available through DTIC’s web-based R&amp;E Gateway.  To protect this information, DTIC regulates access through a database of registered users.  In addition, DTIC uses commercial software in compliance with DoD Identity Management Standards to provide instant authenticated access to users of the DoD Common Access Card (CAC)/Federal Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards, industry PIV-I cards or External Certificate Authority (ECA).  DTIC’s unclassified assets, tools and community interaction capabilities foster innovation, competition and identification of solutions in an access-controlled environment.

Focus on User Communities and Distribution Points:  DTIC supports user communities on the network where they work, i.e., NIPRNET, SIPRNET and public internet, and uniquely provides access controls within unclassified and classified material to protect intellectual property in our search, distribution, and collaboration tools.

- DoD’s RDT&amp;E Enterprise:  As a Field Activity to ASD(R&amp;E)/AT&amp;L, DTIC’s priority is the RDT&amp;E enterprise, hosting information assets and tools on the NIPRNET (the primary network for the community).

- Warfighter:  Improving coordination between the acquisition enterprise and warfighter communities, DTIC hosts a subset of information assets and tools on the SIPRNET. DTIC is working to expand the availability of science and technology (S&amp;T) information, to include Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D), on the SIPRNET.  DTIC is continuing its efforts to establish parity of information and capabilities on applications hosted on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET platforms.

- Industry and Academia via Public Internet:  Engaging industry outside the NIPRNET firewall to support acquisition improvement initiatives and encourage the introduction of innovation, DTIC hosts unclassified public information and tools accessible to all users on the Internet. The Public Access initiative adds importance to the public distribution point, to encourage technology transfer of basic and public research to the private sector, and to give an economic boost to small businesses that can use that data to provide new applications to consumers.

Summary.  DTIC protects and preserves DoD’s multi-billion dollar investment in research, which empowers the acquisition enterprise through innovative tools, information systems, and decision support capabilities. The efficiency benefits can be enormous.  Each 1 percent increase in the reuse of S&amp;T efforts produces over $100 Million in savings that can be redirected.  Those savings come from elimination of inefficient redundancy (and unnecessary delays), increased community interaction, and ultimately, a more capable military.  DTIC is uniquely positioned to support and to ensure the value of DoD’s R&amp;D portfolio is fully realized.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs), established under DoD Instruction 3200.14, serve as a vital resource in providing timely, relevant information directly to users when and where it is needed. IACs serve as a bridge between the warfighter and the Acquisition/Research community, providing essential technical analysis and data support to a diverse customer base, to include the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, and the Military Services. IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies. The IACs create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements. IAC operations directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key CCMD operational issues such as cyber security, unmanned aerial vehicle visual/audible signature reduction, and improvements to the ballistic resistance of body armor.

The IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies. In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing scientific and technical information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges.  Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Technical Area Task (TAT) order processing, Basic Center Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense R&amp;E community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for shared direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations, with OSD-COMPT and Office of General Counsel concurrence.  This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&amp;E community at large.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides funding for the Management Headquarters (HQ) element of the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), a DoD Field Activity to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)/AT&amp;L).  The PE supports personnel compensation for HQ-assigned civilians, along with related administrative support costs.  This second DTIC PE, established in FY 2017, is designed to track activities deemed as headquarters functions, with no operational efficiencies or enhancement to mission.

The PE supports the following HQ functions and mission essential activities critical to the success of DTIC’s business operations, and mandated by law or regulation: 
- Activity leadership, strategic planning, and Front Office support staff.
-- The front office staff (6 authorizations) represents a small component of this PE.  Most of the specialized functions and skill-sets described below are centralized activities within the PE, yet support the larger organization and its employees.  These activities were consolidated as a means to improve efficiencies throughout DTIC, and are essential to the operation of DTIC’s primary PE 0605801KA.
-- Reductions to DTIC’s HQ staffing levels continue, reducing civilian full time equivalents (FTEs) below FY 2017 and FY 2018 levels. 
- Financial Management and Comptroller.  Provides integrated resource management at the Agency level to obtain, control, and execute budget and manpower authorities to support the organization's mission requirements.  Develops and prepares agency budget documents and exhibits for submission to both OSD and Congress.
-- Accounting support to DTIC’s mission operations; partners with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to present accurate financial reporting and Fund Balance with Treasury. 
-- Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) activities and oversight in compliance with the Department’s audit goals, objectives, and milestones.
- Human Resources (HR) Liaison Support.  Provides the DTIC enterprise with payroll processing and “Hire to Retire” mission support; oversees and organizes employee training, professional development, and certification programs (e.g., Acquisition, Financial Management, and IT programs).
-- Coordinates recruitment placement and classification action for the mission areas; liaison to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for HR servicing and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) program maintenance.
- Mandatory Records Management compliance activities and administration programs.
- IT Management/Chief Information Officer (CIO).  Collects, analyzes, and reports information necessary to effectively and efficiently manage enterprise IT resources; CIO functions are performed in compliance with DoD-CIO guidance, instructions and mandates. 
- IT Help Desk/Local Area Network (LAN).  Office automation supports desktop computing customers; resolves IT-related equipment or system incidents; provides assured system and network availability, info delivery, and secure IT solutions to support current and future business and mission requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Basic Research funds support research across physical, material, engineering, computational, and life sciences directed toward increased knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of observable phenomena associated with the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

DTRA's Basic Research effort is the Nation’s only basic research portfolio solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD).  It provides for the discovery and development of basic knowledge by research performers from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry. This investment helps motivate the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions, advancing the body of CWMD knowledge, and improving knowledge of research efforts that support nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management. These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a basic research portfolio under DoD’s Chemical and Biological Defense Program. 

Each year, program and technical managers conduct formal assessments of the portfolio, leveraging deep Science and Technology (S&amp;T) expertise within DTRA, as well as from the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group, independent external panel reviews, and other CWMD-focused stakeholders. This coordination facilitates unique, CWMD-relevant basic research while eliminating unintended duplication of effort in the broader defense S&amp;T community.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project, as the nation’s only basic research portfolio solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) CWMD mission areas.  This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.  

This project aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.  The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers.  Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  

This project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD.  The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation.  Each individual research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions.  This research will enable new capabilities to: better understand the environment, threats and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and/or dispose of WMD threats; and safeguard the force by managing consequences.  Each program manager's portfolio leverages a wide range of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, information and network sciences and focuses basic research on the CWMD mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Applied Research program element funds the expansion and application of basic scientific knowledge in order to develop novel materials, devices, systems, and methods supporting next generation concepts and technologies that enable advances in WMD surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification.

This Applied Research portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction established annually by DTRA.  The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances DTRA’s Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by balancing the following imperatives: invest in DTRA’s applied research capabilities and increase the CWMD technology base to maximize future pay-off; capitalize on opportunities to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges that must be resolved prior to system-specific technology investigations and development; and ensure applied research efforts are directly aligned to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The increase in FY 2019 is due to the net effect of increased investment to counter Improvised Explosive Device/small Unmanned Aerial Systems (IED/sUAS) (i.e., Tier 1 and 2 UAS, including rotary and fixed winged), a realignment of funding to program element 0603160BR for CWMD terrorism support, a realignment to DTRA's Operations and Maintenance portfolio in support of the Defense Threat Reduction Analysis Center (DTRIAC), and lower economic assumptions for inflation.  The funding level in this program element continues to reflect the impact of incremental Service Requirement Review Board reductions, as part of the Department of Defense reform agenda, for consolidation and reduction of service contracts.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities.  The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project.  On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.

DTRA’s Counter - Improvised Explosive Device / Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED/C-sUAS) efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD strategic deterrence system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment.  This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration.  These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group.  The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This capability provides structured and systematic end-to-end test event planning, preparation, management, execution, and data analysis.  It also offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management.  The facility leverages 50 years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferent nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD.  Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the Department of Defense (DoD) and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enable Rapid Capability Delivery. Understanding the threat drives a DTRA-JIDO deliberate, structured, and proactive approach to identify and validate urgent or emergent capability gaps and requirements. JIDO's continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces enables early identification and understanding of C-IED and C-IT gaps, vulnerabilities, and risks and the timely validation, resourcing, development, and delivery of C-IED and C-IT material and non-material solutions. DTRA-JIDO technical integrators embedded with deployed forces further enables rapid adjustments to solutions as the threat’s adaptation evolves.

DTRA provides DoD up to an 18-month “head start” on addressing critical warfighter gaps, and enables DoD to deliver the most technologically advanced response to improvised threats.  These capabilities are developed from previous JIDO experience and in concert with OGAs, National Labs, Academia, Private Industry, and International Partners.

This project employs Technology Outreach as well as development of modeling-and-simulation and analysis support tools to identify and validate urgent and emergent capability requirements and associated gaps.  It provides rapid acquisition and delivery of C-IED and C-IT solutions to address these requirements and gaps.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Advanced Technology Development program element funds the development and testing of subsystems and components for integration into prototype systems with the potential to transition into mature, state-of-the-art WMD surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification capabilities.

The Advanced Technology Development portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives as well as with Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction which is established annually by DTRA.  The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) Efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&amp;T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability.  Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.

DTRA’s Counter- Improvised Explosive Device / Counter - Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED/C-sUAS) efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.  The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and to (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Counter Improvised-Explosive Device (C-IED) Counter Improvised-Threat (Counter-IT) Technology Demonstration, Prototype Development, and Testing program element supports the development, demonstration, and testing of defeat technologies for advanced wireless signals, compatible electronic counter-measures for IED and IED-facilitation defeat/neutralization, miniaturized and integrated sensors, hand-held detectors, and cutting edge Information Technology enabler capabilities. 

This includes providing and enabling open, fully sharable information, and analytical software tools; situational understanding of the threat's tactics, techniques, and procedures (what is urgent and emerging); C-IED and related C-IT material solutions prototyping, experimentation, development, and delivery; and training integration support to ensure deploying and deployed forces' readiness is sustained as new equipment and methods are delivered.
 
Assist Situational Understanding (JS) of threat-network activities. The IED and other disruptive improvised threats represent a continuing and irregular threat for deployed U.S. and coalition forces. In order to counter the threat, a deep understanding of IED and improvised threat use and facilitation is required. This DTRA capability is enabled by an advanced information technology infrastructure, analytical software tools, deployed and embedded DTRA operations integrators and intelligence analysts, and current and integrated operational data. Supported by CONUS-based reach-back linked to the intelligence community, the inter-agency, and coalition partners, analytics, when combined with production from the Defense Intelligence Enterprise, enables more complete threat awareness and understanding by deploying and deployed US forces to support their planning and targeting. This core function also informs research and development and threat-based rapid prototyping investment decisions, guides international and interagency coordination to enable counter threat-network support, and supplements U.S. Joint Force pre-deployment training to ensure the most recent threat is understood and new counter improvised threat systems can be properly utilized.

Enable DoD Responses to Improvised Weapons (JR). DTRA builds counter-IED and improvised threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners. Through a robust communities of action approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop counter IED and improvised threat solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed U.S. Joint Forces. This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire U.S. Government and its partners to garner support for counter IED and improvised threat development and delivery.

Enable Rapid Capability Delivery (JC). Understanding the threat drives a DTRA deliberate, structured, and proactive approach to identify and validate urgent or emergent capability gaps and requirements. DTRA's continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces enables early identification and understanding of C-IED and C-IT gaps, vulnerabilities, and risks and the timely validation, resourcing, development, and delivery of C-IED and C-IT material and non-material solutions. DTRA technical integrators embedded with deployed forces further enables rapid adjustments to solutions as the threat’s adaptation evolves.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables DTRA to understand and analyze global threat information. It is an Information Technology (IT) Operations  quick-reaction capability supported by the rapid collection, fusion, and dissemination of operational-intelligence, and technology in order to enable the defeat of threat networks that employ disruptive technologies.

The JIDO advanced Mission Information Technology (MIT) capability, its software Systems Integration Lab (SIL), and embedded CCMD-direct support and reachback staff, continuously create capabilities to ingest, fuse, analyze, and present mission relevant data and information that provides immediate assistance to DoD and the whole of government. This capability, called Catapult, is a fully accredited SIPR and JWICS based analytical cloud architecture.  The Catapult architecture pulls from over more than 850 SIPR and more than 170 JWICS data sources and allows for simple and open data access, system stability, scalability, and advanced analytics.  In addition to Catapult, the MIT created another significant capability called Voltron.  Voltron provides analysts access to SIGINT data within a secure and IC-accredited software developer environment. Voltron, give analysts access to continuously new models in support of “Attack the Network” analysis and operations.  Voltron provides analysts access to methodologies involving multi-INT fusion in an easy to use interface. These methods are based on years of experience supporting tactical targeting environment and built in collaboration with other teams across the Intelligence Community.  There are currently more than 75 models in Voltron available to the user community.

DTRA's authorities and mission have enabled a unique “Path-to-Production” (PTP) for mission-driven IT solutions.  This unique development environment includes an integrated Cyber Security Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) process, an in-house collateral Authorizing Official (AO), a strong partnership between technologists and intelligence analysts working real-world problems, and a collaborative and innovative culture that launches practical software solutions rapidly.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This will include the Common Intelligence Picture/Common Operational Picture and technical data and will serve as the platform for creation of C-IED/C-sUAS analytics.
- Build a data science enabled module that will crawl through Catapult reporting and identify reports related to IED/sUAS events. Through machine learning techniques and application of training data, the team will train this module to identify reports that normal queries may miss. These reports will serve as the base data set for the C-IED/C-sUAS event table.
- Prepare a list of vetted IED/sUAS events pulled from Catapult reporting.  Events will be broken down into relevant categories with associated attributes.
- Stand up a database of technical data associated with known IED/sUAS. Library will be available for direct query and incorporated into other C-IED/C-sUAS capabilities.
- Integrate Virtual Management System processes and capabilities to build 3D models for various maritime vessels requested by external SOF customer.
- Develop and test a software mapping tool and spatial data analytics technology web service capable of a providing user functionality to create basic geospatial analytic outputs (i.e., line of sight, route vulnerability, etc.).
- Generate additional Data Science tables populated with entities extracted from Catapult using RipIt regex trees.   This will provide a “truth set” for future Natural Language Processing.
- Develop and Test new tools allowing for the visualizing (and effects) of underwater explosions.
- Develop a new application (Thor) as a “rules-based” approach to existing Avengers/Phoenix models. Thor is planned to enhance sensitive site exploitation (SSE) data with a tool will provide comprehensive approach to SSE vetting.
- Develop capability to visualize and derive trends for Air and Marine Operations Center non-commercial flight data.
- Develop and test an Interactive interface which will provide access to the Avenger tool suite on selective networks.
- Scope and Design the Data Science software and tool development environment as to create containerized tools which will provide a standard working image across the multiple networks.
- Provide a methodology to leveraging contextual clues from reporting, provide additional information about individual person entities extracted from reports. (i.e., job title).
- Develop and Test custom webpages that will provide “pre-vetted” data against analyst problem set. Automated workflow built for specific customer needs. 
- Develop and test a web-based Horizon version to act as a location intelligence discovery tool. The tool will provide geospatial querying within 2D maps to users as a light weight alternative to the smart-client version.
- Develop and test a web-based C2IS2 tool that will provide OP/INTEL users with the capability to capture and manage the processes, observables, and signatures associated with IED operations and use that data for training, analysis, collection planning, and exploitation.
- Continued improvements to the JIDO DevOps Pipeline and maturing the approach to delivery using containers
- Deploy a subset of the Attack the Network Tool Suite (ANTS) application on Non-Classified Local Area Network and an easy navigation directory.
- Provide Integration and Test activities against a Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES) instance of Catapult. Upgrade and test all applications to work with Metrics across the ANTS Suite, upgrade the user account and authentication in relation to the F5/Certificate Authentication System, and deploy Horizon Web.
- Conduct System Integration of Catapult and all ANTS applications on the new HP Moonshot hardware.
- Support proper deployment procedures and provide a test environment for the newly deployed Catapult and ANTS related applications on HP Moonshot hardware.
- Test all Catapult and all ANTS applications at a COOP location.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enhances U.S. Joint Forces’ responsiveness to improvised weapons. DTRA builds counter-threat solutions in full collaboration with its partners. Through a robust communities of action approach, DTRA coordinates with the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), the Joint Staff, the Military Departments/Services, the interagency, coalition partners, industry, and academia to develop C-IED and C-IT solutions that further enable the maneuverability and force protection of deployed U.S. Joint Forces. This methodology leverages the authorities, access, and capabilities of the entire U.S. Government and its partners as counter-improvised threat solutions are developed and realized. 

DTRA responds to the following improvised threats: Home-Made Explosives (HME), Vehicle-Borne IED (VBIED), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Vehicle-Attached IED (VAIED), Anti-Armor IED (AIED) Buried IED, Radio Controlled IED (RCIED), Person-Borne IED (PBIED), Booby Trapped Structures (BTS), Improvised WMD, Water-Borne IED (WBIED), Tunnels, and emerging threats that are identified by the warfighter deployed forward.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project harnesses an in-depth understanding of the threat leading to identification and validation of urgent or emergent counter-threat requirements and Combatant Command capability gaps. In turn, DTRA-JIDO rapidly provides Counter - Improvised Explosive Device/ Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED/C-sUAS) and C-IT solutions to prevent or mitigate battlefield operational surprise. DTRA’s continuous embedded presence with deployed U.S. Joint Forces and coordination with Military Service components enables full transparency of investment activities and provides for the early identification and understanding of C-IED and C-IT risks and vulnerabilities which enable the timely validation, development, and delivery of counter-threat material and non-material solutions.

DTRA delivers counter-threat materiel solutions in support of US Joint Forces supporting contingency operations, effectively addressing changes to threat Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TT&amp;P) affecting deployed forces.  Capability incorporates an embedded tactical presence to understand a continuously evolving threat environment and complete visibility of the current DoD counter-threat portfolio to enable rapid response to warfighter vulnerabilities and to enhance force protection and maneuverability.  DTRA responds to the following improvised threats: Home-Made Explosives (HME), Vehicle-Borne IED (VBIED), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Vehicle-Attached IED (VAIED), Anti-Armor IED (AIED) Buried IED, Radio Controlled IED (RCIED), Person-Borne IED (PBIED), Booby Trapped Structures (BTS), Improvised WMD, Water-Borne IED (WBIED), Tunnels, and emerging threats that are identified by the warfighter deployed forward.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The goal of the NACT RDT&amp;E program is to enable full compliance of all emerging data availability/data quality requirements and other operational requirements as documented in nuclear CTBT treaty requirements, nuclear-event response requirements, language, CTBT-issued Radionuclide and Waveform Operations Manuals, other CTBT Organization communications, and DoD Treaty Implementation Manager directives.  The IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  The data quality specifications are various data metrics that allow accurate time, location, and yield estimation of a nuclear event.  RDT&amp;E is conducted in support of the NACT’s operational mission to operate, maintain, and sustain the Provisional Technical Secretariat certified waveform and radionuclide CTBT IMS monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratory in accordance with CTBT requirements at the lowest cost.  CTBT IMS data availability/timeliness performance specifications are currently 98% data availability for IMS waveform and 95% for IMS radionuclide systems.  Data quality metrics continue to evolve as the entire CTBT IMS capability is exercised and tested.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is the organization within the Department of Defense chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) requirements, joint operational concepts, and operational architectures.  As part of the Joint Staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to IAMD issues.  JIAMDO is the operational community’s proponent for requirements and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD’s resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads IAMD mission and utility analysis, integrates IAMD within the force protection joint capability area, conducts evaluations, demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures, and provides advocacy for innovative, technically mature, and affordable solutions.  

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the United States. JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the development of the IAMD prioritized capabilities list and the global integrated IAMD assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System.  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and technical oversight of homeland capability solutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Nimble Fire is the Department’s only joint IAMD operator-in-the-loop modeling and simulation capability exploring the Chairman's top five critical joint IAMD capabilities: wide-area surveillance and engagement quality tracking, pre-launch interdiction, non-kinetic post-launch capabilities, ballistic missile discrimination, and increased weapons ranges and lethality.  Nimble Fire events explore joint IAMD capabilities and concepts in the FYDP timeframe combining experienced operators from the tactical communities, virtual simulations accredited by the program offices, current and future advanced capabilities, an integrated air, ballistic and cruise missile threat, and informed scenarios from the Department’s analytical agenda and CCMD operational plans.  JIAMDO brings together stakeholders across the engineering, analytical, and tactical communities to conduct multiple events to assess Joint interoperability of Service and MDA programs of record, explore concepts of employment, inform tactics, techniques and procedures and concepts of operation, provide insights that help shape CCMD integrated priorities and future operational plans, and inform senior leader acquisition and requirements decisions.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is the organization within the Department of Defense (DoD) chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) requirements, joint operational concepts, and operational architectures.  As part of the Joint Staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to IAMD issues.  JIAMDO is the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads mission area and utility analyses for air and missile defense, integrates air and missile defense within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures and concepts.

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in development of the IAMD Prioritized Capability List, the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment, and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) program supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Title 10, Section 153 statutory responsibilities for the analytical support, management, development, evaluation, and implementation of joint concepts in order to advance the operational effectiveness of the future Joint Force and enable the introduction of new capabilities. The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's statutory responsibility to provide “best military advice” to the SECDEF and POTUS by expressing his vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20 year horizon; identifying joint force development implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The overarching goal is to enable investment decisions between near and far term. Concepts drive horizontal integration for force development across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. An intent of the Joint Concepts program is to support senior leader decisions in balancing today’s requirements and future force requirements. Key deliverables include:  

Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) that provides the Chairman's vision for the future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations. 

Family of Joint Concepts, based on National Military Strategy (NMS), provides operational approaches to future challenges or opportunities with respect to Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations in order to guide current and future Joint Force development. 

Joint Concept Transition Plans, developed for each joint concept, document approaches for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) changes in the future Joint Force and identifies conceptual ideas that may require further exploration.  

Joint Operating Environment (JOE) describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force so it can anticipate and prepare for potential conflicts. The JOE articulates the circumstances that are likely to alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. Finally, the JOE provides a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time.

The International Force Development Division’s (IFDD) mission is to ensure collaboration and integration throughout the spectrum of joint force development, so that both the Joint Staff and its Allies and partners invest in any required reforms to ensure continued, interoperable and seamless operations together to meet the objectives in the NMS. The Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC) is an initiative led by the United States Joint Staff which partners with 22 countries and international organizations designed to develop and assess non-materiel force development solutions and close capability gaps in multinational operations. Funds are used solely for travel in support of U.S. led projects and events with multinational and coalition partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Current efforts focus on updating the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) so it extends the strategic approach developed in the 2016 NMS out to 2035. The CCJO modification will provide a common view of the future operating environment and a vision for how the future joint force will conduct globally integrated operations.  Also, the revised CCJO will identify force development implications and required capabilities to maintain U.S. competitive advantage against emerging threats out to 2035. In partnership with selected Combatant Commands and the Services, development of the Joint Operating Concepts to address strategic challenges has begun.  The Joint Operating Concept (JOC) – China and JOC - Russia prospectuses have been approved. The Director Joint Staff has endorsed the framework and authorized the continued development of two JOCs.  The initial research on JOC – North Korea has begun and the prospectus is expected to be approved in early FY 2018.  The concept prospectus describes the compelling military challenge and how it will be addressed in the future. JOC – Iran is in the very early stages of prospectus development. Study of the 2035 operating environment continues and informs understanding of military challenges associated with the common view of the future operating environment.  Work with Five Eyes (FVEY) countries is focused on developing a FVEY common view of the future operating environment.  Development support was completed for the Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning and the Joint Concept for Operating in the Information Environment.  Concept implementation is underway for the Joint Concepts for rapid aggregation, robotic and autonomous systems, human aspects of military operations, access and maneuver in the global commons, preventing the transfer and use of weapons of mass Destruction, and operational contract support.</r2:Description>

This complex and multi-variant task requires modernized technologies that provide integrated information linking authoritative force structure data (derived from the GFM DI Organizational Servers) to C2 data (resident in GFM mission applications). The Joint Staff Operations Directorate is responsible for GFM allocation and is the functional manager of the GFM mission applications. Accordingly, the Joint Staff will employ a strategy for efficiently fulfilling Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.

The DoD must quickly transition from legacy force management systems that promulgate data disparity across the Defense enterprise in order to meet national military objectives that have evolved from large force scenarios to operations that include small-to-full scale activities. As stated in both the NSS and NMS, our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic means. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that keeps pace with globally changing threats to rapidly and accurately accomplish force sourcing activities to support SecDef allocation decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service’s Organizatonal Server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces. Key deliverables include incrementally developed, operationally realistic capability enhancements focused on resource-informed planning and GFM sourcing functionality required by JROCMs, the Capability Development Document (CDD) for GFM DI; Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Definition Package (CDP); Joint Operation Planning Process (JOPP) and Assessment CDP; and Force Planning &amp; Deployment Planning/Execution CDP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

RDT&amp;E efforts for assignment and apportionment functions ended in FY 2015 with the declaration of Full Operation Capability (FOC) for the Automated Global Force Management Tool. GFM DI planned milestones must be met to enable a global visibility capability. GFM applications managed by the Joint Staff are used by the JSAS family of programs. This effort to fund critical upgrades is a precondition to GFM DI EFS integration.</r2:Description>

This approach is essential in a budget constrained environment to fulfill the DoD CIO "DoD Cloud Way Forward" focused on service-oriented architecture that flattens the legacy "Silos of Databases" paradigm by leveraging decentralized infrastructure services. It will enable DoD CIO foundational IT changes with enhanced cybersecurity that provides information sharing within the Joint Command and Control mission partner environment without redundant or duplicative resources. The strategy will result in initial incremental development of the Joint Force Capability Catalog (JFCC) virtual application with a Force Element Inventory Predictive Analysis Tool (FEI PAT) utilizing dynamic force visibility that provides timely, accurate and dynamic data representing U.S. Forces in motion for the 34 GFM leading indicators and Combatant Commanders initial force requirements as identified in the NMS priority OPLANS.  The Initial Operating Capability (IOC) will be achieved by first aggregating the Service Org Server data into the Global Laydown Server to link Service generated Organization Unique Identifiers (OUIDs) for  force elements identified to establish the Joint C2 relationships to the Allocation process (OPCON and TACON Links). This will provide the capability to establish the OUID/ Unit Identification Code (UIC) linkages in Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDDs), then map them to GFM allocation information (Force Tracking Number [FTN], Request for Forces [RFF], Deployment Order/Line Number [DEPORD/LNR]), and Assignment of the Forces For Unified Commands</r2:Text>

This capability will provide a dynamic representation of military force disposition. GLS algorithms will enable the GFM mission applications to present meaningful information required for timely and accurate decision making to assist the Chairman in providing military advice. The JFCC will serve as a user interface that uses the GLS algorithms to streamline operations planning and GFM execution in support of Combatant Commander requirements. 

The FY 2018 strategy will focus on a unit type capabilities registration functionality within the JFCC that will unify the unit-based readiness and unit type reporting process by obtaining on-hand forces (personnel and equipment) via the EFS (GFM DI) standard format. The FY 2018 incremental development of the JFCC virtual application and associated dynamic force visibility will provide the true inventory of force availability based on Service employable entities (unit types) and sustainability factors, to enable the use of on-hand Service force capabilities identified down to the Service-defined lowest deployable entities for executive decision making and GFM mission execution.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The JSAS efforts will result in a Global Laydown Server and Joint Force Capabilities Catalog that supports a global visibility capability allowing for joint future force integration with information requirements needed to support timely and dynamic response to Combatant Commanders’ unforeseen contingency requirements.   This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management. Program measures include the following:

1. Meet IOC that enables rapid generation of Global Force Management (GFM) decision-making information for policy-makers and Combatant Commands based on authoritative Service force capability, readiness, availability and current employment data.

2. Reduce the manual process of assembling capability, readiness, availability, employment as the first step to providing enhanced force management decision-making. Mining this data is currently a labor-intensive, time-consuming process and significantly impedes rapid response capabilities.

3. Services, CCMDs, Joint Staff and OSD will be able to efficiently collect and analyze force generation data supporting GFM in far less time than the current process, and with an authoritative common view of the sourcing-to-employment tracking of forces. 

4. The JFCC will enable the rapid generation of information when making time-sensitive decisions and allow a joint planner to use standard and consistent force structure data in the GFM sourcing solution generation and deployment planning, execution, and distribution processes.

5. Ability to meet the VCJCS guidance to meet the GFM DI Full Operating Capability (FOC) by FY 2020.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a joint training environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Joint Simulation System (JSS)

- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)

- Air Force JNTC

- Navy JNTC

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training that improves interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and creating a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System, consisting of the Joint Theater Level Simulation and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation, provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO, and multinational partners. The joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners by continuing limited investments ensuring Joint Theater Level Simulation and Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation remain relevant providing reliable, low-cost, small footprint, distributed, and deployable joint training solutions. 
 
JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based joint operations core curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training (externally funded); and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&amp;E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 program goals and objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.

Air Force JNTC:  Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment. Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program enables Service and Combatant Commands to train as they operate. The funding requested continues to modernize joint training capabilities into a single integrating architecture aligned to DoD Chief Information Officer IT mandates. Funding supports the development of cloud-enabled modular training application services. Program intent is to reduce dependence on touch labor, and mitigate the impact of reductions in operation and sustainment funding. Momentum must be maintained to deliver operationally relevant training environments and respond to changes in global security landscape and the warfighters' operational environment. JNTC enables the Department of Defense to be responsive to the warfighters’ changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices. In FY 2018, this investment continues expanding capabilities and access for Service and Combatant Command trainers to plan and execute joint training. Funds support improved relevance and realism of training by providing capabilities that replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>JNTC provides the technical standards, architecture (blueprint), and development processes required to integrate joint training programs.  The Joint Training Environment (JTE) is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes with accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating programmatic actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience. These capabilities enhance the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  RDT&amp;E funding supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  The resulting capabilities enable selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command headquarter levels.  The funding increases warfighter access to semi-automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment through web-based, modular cloud capabilities. 

The Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the joint force to be responsive to the warfighters’ changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed joint live, virtual, and constructive enablers.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is DoD's authoritative source for online joint training.  JKO is a DoD enterprise-wide, Joint individual training toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products, services, and enabling training technology.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD program goals, CJCS high interest training issues, Joint Staff training priorities, and JKO stakeholders (Combatant Commands, Services, and Combat Support Agencies, interagency, and multinational) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve all components of the joint content management architecture including:  

1. JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit. JKO LCMS is necessary to develop, host and deliver JKO courses, track and report students’ progress, completions and survey results more effectively and efficiently. JKO LCMS extends web-based, distributed access to mission-critical joint training requirements. There are currently over 2.7 million registered users of the JKO LCMS.

2. Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF "battle staffs" will be adequately trained, as individuals and as collective staffs, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and prerequisite JKO courses enable blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises that augment the joint event learning cycle and support  meeting Combatant Commander exercise objectives.

3. JKO mobile application training device development:  Development and enhancements facilitate the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (cell phones and tablets).  JKO mobile application extends access to training courses and learning resources to personal use of mobile phones and tablets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These capabilities increase access to, and facilitate the training and preparation of, hundreds of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command (CCMD) theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets.  JKO LCMS development and enhancements are required to develop, host, deliver, track, report and support students’ completions, progress and survey results more effectively and efficiently.  C/JTF “battle staffs” will be better trained, as individuals and as staffs, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.

Develop, test and deliver two JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS) releases resulting in improved cybersecurity, and a more effective and efficient online training management application that is interoperable with DoD personnel management systems.  Requirements will be derived from CCMD user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness and the Chairman’s training guidance. The objectives are to provide a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit, and develop content for pre-exercise training and support (as required by the Services) and support individual and unit training for Special Purpose - Marine Air Ground Task Force missions.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and the ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~550,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by providing them global 24/7 access to mandatory joint training as they prepare to participate in CCMD exercises and real world missions. JKO will also focus on enhancements to improve the management of individuals’ training records and readiness reporting by extending information sharing and web services with DoD personnel management systems.  

2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS).  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for CCMD exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations.  The SGST will be used as part of the OSD-endorsed blended learning training component in approximately eight CCMD collective training exercises to prepare individuals serving on CCMD required small functional teams and C/JTF "battle staffs."  

3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing its comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile application and mobile training products. JKO’s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO mobile application. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide.</r2:Text>

Develop, test, and deliver two JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS) releases resulting in improved cybersecurity, and a more effective and efficient online training management application that is interoperable with DoD personnel management systems.  Requirements will be derived from Combatant Command user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by Deputy Assistan Secretary of Defense for Readiness (DASD(R)) and the Chairman’s training guidance to provide a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit, and perform  technical updates of content from FLASH to HTML5 for pre-exercise training and support. JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~550,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by providing global 24/7 access to mandatory joint training as they prepare to participate in CCMD exercises and real world missions. JKO will also focus on enhancements to improve the management of individual training records and readiness reporting as the JKO LCMS extends information sharing and web services with DoD personnel management systems.  JKO will continue to maintain compliance with current security directives and to enhance functionality based on user experience and feedback.

2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO LCMS.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for Combatant Command exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations. The SGST will be used as part of the OSD-endorsed blended learning training packages in approximately eight Combatant Command training exercises and additional training events preparing individuals serving on Combatant Command boards, centers, cells and working groups supporting small functional teams and C/JTF "battle staffs."  Individual training proficiency improvement will be measured and quantified as part of the exercise design.  JKO will continue to maintain compliance with current security directives and to enhance SGST functionality based on user experience and feedback.

3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing a comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile application and mobile training products. JKO’s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO mobile application. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, Podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered onsite and on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide. JKO will continue to maintain compliance with dynamic cybersecurity requirements as well as staying current with dynamic industry standard operating systems to enhance its mobile capability based on user experience and feedback.</r2:Text>

The Marine Corps will provide key elements of the proposed change that will allow the USMC to structure a variety of LVC enhancements in a more cost-effective manner to support training efforts within the GRF, NATO, CCMDs, SP-MAGTF and other deploying forces.  By expanding the capabilities of existing capabilities through partnerships and cost-sharing efforts that focus on emerging theater training requirements, the changes proposed herein leverage cloud and other technologies to provide the training necessary to address several DoD goals and objectives listed in Commandant's planning guidance and Chairman’s joint training guidance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Measures:
1. Number of collaborative advanced technology demonstrations (i.e., projects supporting transition of new technology into joint training).

2. Number of improvement plans defined (i.e., articulation of plans for future enhancements to joint training).

3. Influence on key Service and international ADL meetings and conferences that advance the discovery, sharing and delivery of interoperable training content. 

4. Increase sharing of data among DoD, other federal agencies, and state and local education departments throughout the U.S. by making educational resources discoverable and retrievable.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Applying small incremental amounts of investments to Department of Defense (DOD), other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Small incremental co-investments with DOD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allow USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Technology development needs in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via agency announcements and calls for white papers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Technology Development (project S200) conducts rapid prototyping and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts rapid prototyping of information and broadcast system technology.  Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media &amp; Product Selection, Distribution &amp; Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). The Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Joint Task Force level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and multi-national partners.  It connects the SOF warfighter with the essential intelligence information and provides situation awareness information to the SOF leadership at all echelons.  The four components of DCGS-SOF include the following:  The Enterprise provides infrastructure and processing capability to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing. Full Motion Video PED provides (FMV) PED capabilities in garrison and deployed environments of manned and unmanned sensors.  SILENT DAGGER provides Signals Intelligence exploitation capability in both garrison and deployed environments. The All Source Information Fusion (ASIF) will provide the intelligence analytical tools via a global and disconnected architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). The Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Joint Task Force level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and multi-national partners.  It connects the SOF warfighter with the essential intelligence information and provides situation awareness information to the SOF leadership at all echelons.  The four components of DCGS-SOF include the following:  The Enterprise provides infrastructure and processing capability to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing. Full Motion Video (FMV) PED provides PED capabilities in garrison and deployed environments of manned and unmanned sensors.  SILENT DAGGER provides Signals Intelligence exploitation capability in both garrison and deployed environments. The All Source Information Fusion (ASIF) will provide the intelligence analytical tools via a global and disconnected architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-SOF leverages SOF programs, DoD partners, National labs, and other Government Agencies to integrate commercial/government off-the-shelf systems, and other mature technologies into the Program of Record which resides within the SOF Information Enterprise and enables more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of data and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements.  The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, interagency, and Coalition tactical ISR PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by an engineering development team.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small businesses with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 was the first year USSOCOM participated in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SF100 Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser; AC-130H/W/U and MC-130E/H/P, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking; near real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.  

SF200 CV-22 Development/Test and Evaluation:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA radar best known as Silent Knight Radar (SKR) or APQ-187, provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.  There is a plan to develop a Defensive Weapon System (DWS) that gives a ~360 degree field of fire to suppress/eliminate enemy targets.  This effort integrates the SOF unique Color Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) with DWS providing necessary capability improvements identified during operational use and interim contract support.

S750 Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

S875 AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s legacy C-130 fleet.

D615 Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and improve aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

FY 2017:  Net decrease of -$7.489 million is due to a transfer of funds to Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs (-$5.928 million), a congressional reduction for prior year carryover for SOMPE (-$0.890 million), and a decrease for higher command priorities (-$0.671 million).

FY 2018:  None.

FY 2019:  Net increase of $7.387 million is for completion of Phase III integration, testing, and Air Worthiness Release (AWR) for the A/MH-6 Block 3.0 Upgrade ($3.120 million); to complete development and testing of trial kit installation of EC-130J Block Upgrade ($1.263 million); testing of flares and chaff to address emerging threats for RW ASE Upgrades ($4.192 million); flight qualification and AWR testing of the Degraded Visual Environment solution ($3.222 million); continues PSP High Energy Laser (HEL) development of system architecture, acquire beam director subsystem and laser subsystem, interface control documentation, and completes risk reduction for AC-130J aircraft ($30.020 million); continues integration/testing of CV-22 SF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar ($0.898 million); higher command priorities (-$4.024 million); a Departmental economic assumption adjustment (-$1.482 million); and the FY 2019 funding request was reduced by -$29.822 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Schedule: Silent Knight Radar (SKR):  Hardware failures with first 3 LRIP IIA radars delivered delayed Regression Testing and have delayed Initial Operational Test for the MH-60/MH-47 into 4th Quarter FY 2018.  EC-130J SOF-Unique 7.0/8.1 development delay was due to a delay in the 7.0/8.1 Air Force modification contract.

Technical:  None.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

• EC-130J Commando SOLO:  Digital broadcast capabilities are being developed through an incremental acquisition strategy to incorporate and test readily available equipment into the EC-130J aircraft.

• EW – RFCM:  Awarded competitive EMD contract for development. Down selected to the best overall solution to integrate and test an RFCM System on AC/MC-130J aircraft.

• PSP for SOF:  Incremental acquisition strategy to integrate and test the PSP and capability enhancements on donor MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force and other SOF aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• PSP HEL:  AC-130 HEL program utilizes Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division as the government Lead System Integrator of HEL components.  HEL system components purchased under Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium broad area announcement using incremental Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts and cost sharing agreements.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Awarded delivery order on Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract to integrate and test the SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar on MC-130J aircraft and develop modifications to aircraft displays and controls. Government developmental test and evaluation, FY 2018 - FY 2020; Operational Test and Evaluation, FY 2021; Required Assets Available, Q1FY2022.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Competitive EMD contract was awarded to Raytheon in FY 2007 for radar B Kit design, development, and testing.  Subsequent MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit design, integration, and test efforts awarded to Lockheed Martin (SOFSA). Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) awarded to Raytheon in January 2017 for software development of Software Version (SW ver) 7.14 (outcome of 2017 Limited Users Test).  Continued software development to enhance interoperability with other on aircraft systems in FY18/19 followed by operational capability additions and move to sensor fusion TF FY20-24.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in order to make them usable by smaller SOF ISR platforms, such as Group 2-3 UAS.  This development will include the integration of the ISR capability with the platform’s C2 and Communications systems as appropriate.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The funding in this program supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV-22 platform.

Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform. 

CV-22 SF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar: Provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable radar to replace obsolescing and APQ-186 terrain following/avoidance radar.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Silent Knight Radar (SKR) was developed by USSOCOM to replace the existing, obsolescing APQ-186 TF/TA multimode radar on the CV-22.  The acquisition strategy for the CV-22 SF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar program is to procure radar units and radar software modifications through the USSOCOM SKR Program Management Office. Contracts will be awarded to integrate SKR into the V-22 platform and buy aircraft modification kits, using a mixture of both sole source and competitive contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:Description>

The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s legacy C-130 fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components to the extent possible and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational beyond FY 2020 and until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.</r2:Description>

Additionally, these threat systems are technically evolving at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid counter measure system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and pre-planned product improvements (P3I)/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, flares, and associated qualification testing.  P3I upgrades may include, but are not limited to, expansion of frequency ranges on existing systems, modernization of legacy components, and studies directed at potential "collaborative off-boarding/on-boarding" detect/countermeasure capabilities to provide expanded coverage for aircrews in a high threat environment.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises of two distinct efforts:  airframe and avionics upgrades.  Additionally within the airframe upgrade, there are two sub efforts (new rotor blades/flight control kits and new integrated airframe shells).  The airframe efforts (new rotor blades/flight control kits and new shells) will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframes.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-unique upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. 

•  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in DVE.  A competitive source selection process was conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

•  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   

•  IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Department of Navy IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The Government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.   

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

•  MPU - Provides for future cockpit architecture studies that will help define the replacement of current mission and video processors for all ARSOA platforms.  Additionally it will address near term required upgrades to existing components.  Potential upgrades will be through existing OEMs, while the future cockpit architecture studies will be competitively awarded.

•  The ASE Upgrades program develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment and flares.   For new systems, other services’ development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the OEM.

•  The SRTV project integrates and tests software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time FMV intelligence.  A variety of contracting methods will be used for acquiring test assets, accomplishing SOF-unique modifications and testing to include use of other services’ contracts, competition, sole source awards, and directed efforts of government organizations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Special Operations Tactical Video System/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (TVS/RSTA);  Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).

U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.

NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by leveraging National Geospatial-Intelligence (NGA) and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units to include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid development, fielding and deployment, and focus on transitioning to SOCOM Programs of Records (POR). These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM’s existing Military Intelligence Programs.  NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM’s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automate radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.</r2:Description>

This is accomplished by partnering with existing IC POR to incorporate SOF mission requirements into current and developing technologies and assets.  This leveraging of funds increases national and commercial systems awareness, demonstrates the tactical utility of national systems and commercial data, tests technologies and evaluates operational concepts in biennial Joint Staff Special Projects, and allows for the transition of promising concepts and technologies to other SOF program offices for execution.

•  JTWS is a SoS leveraging commercial technologies and partnerships with other government agencies.  The POR will identify Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)/Government Off The Shelf capabilities requiring minimal modifications and only use new development when necessary. JTWS will address the continuously evolving threat environments on the Ground, Air, Maritime, and Unmanned Aircraft System variants, leverage existing partnerships with the National Security Agency and other government partners to integrate and sustain systems based on prioritized need from the Components and as emerging threats require technology modernizations.  Additionally, the POR will work to find common solutions across the variants and increase interoperability in order to reduce duplication of efforts.  The contracting strategy is a mixture of full and open competition for prime integrators and leveraging existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for COTS procurement.

•   HF-TTL utilizes a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide highly sophisticated TTL and close target audio/video devices capable of operating in various environments as needed to meet SOF operational requirements. Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, device level modifications, integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.  

•  TVS/RSTA employs an evolutionary strategy to incorporate the latest state of technology within its product line to provide upgraded next-generation technology insertion of COTS systems and address the changing threat environment to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations. 

•   SOFPREP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.

•   ISP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.

•   SSE uses a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide next-generation technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities supporting SOF exploitation mission requirements.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Special Operation Forces (SOF) must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals. 

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project provides for the development, testing, integration, and evaluation of specialized equipment, to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF in varied missions; counter-improvised explosive device systems, to meet continually emerging Counter RC-IED threats; and signature reducing materials and technologies, to reduce the probability of detection by battlefield threat sensors.

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. 

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Munitions Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.  Provides for testing and integration of Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition Systems (LMAMS) onto SOF-unique platforms to meet the operational needs of the SOF operator in high threat environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems, load bearing equipment, and personnel safety equipment to improve the mobility of SOF, while conducting varied missions.  Signature reducing materials and technology reduce the probability of detection by battlefield threat sensors.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4 systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) includes the consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies (previously Program Element (PE) 0304210BB); MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), (previously PE 0305219BB); MQ-8, (previously PE 0305231BB); RQ-11, UAV (previously PE 1105232BB); and RQ-7 UAV, (previously PE 1105233BB).

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Unmanned ISR develops and deploys special capabilities to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of ISR and Targeting capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding:     

FY 2017:  Net decrease of -$3.007 million due to the reprogramming increase of $0.200 million for development and combat evaluation of selected sensor delivery platforms and mounted or deliverable ISR capabilities for global contingencies including short-notice requirements and decrease of $3.207 million reprogrammed for higher command priorities.

FY 2018:  None.

FY 2019:  Net decrease of $0.790 million is an increase that continues evaluation of unique sensor technologies, persistent stare, and quick reaction systems ($3.219 million); a decrease due to a Departmental economic assumption adjustment (-$0.263 million); and the FY2019 funding request was reduced by -$3.746 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

FY 2019 OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.  Increase of $11.700 million is for advanced payload development; development and integration of Beyond Line of Sight wiring harnesses required to operate SOF-unique sensors, VORTEX encrypted data link capability, and Persistent Close Air Support collaborative engagement management capabilities on the SOF Gray Eagle Extended Range UAS.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.

Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications to ground control stations. SAFC develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities that address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. This program also provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program element also provides for pre-acquisition activities to quickly respond to new requirements for SOF surface and undersea mobility, looking at multiple alternatives to include cross-platform technical solutions, service-common solutions, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf technologies, and new development efforts.  

The Underwater Systems project provides for EMD of combat submersibles, SOF operator diving systems, underwater support systems, and underwater equipment.  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component and prototype development) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, equipment, and diving systems are used by SOF in the conduct of infiltration/extraction, personnel/material recovery, hydrographic/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  

The Surface Craft project provides for EMD of medium and heavy surface combatant craft, combatant craft mission equipment, and pre-planned product improvement and technology insertion engineering changes to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  This project element also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  CCM was a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistic support.  

•  CCH SEALION I &amp; II were transitioned from United States Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I &amp; II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity.  SEALION III is Sole Source to the OEM in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I &amp; II.  

•  CCME emphasizes on spearheading Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology for successful transition into SOF Combatant Crafts. CCME accomplishes this by employing the full spectrum of contracting services, using existing contracts where appropriate, and leveraging from other Government agencies to include the Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L Science &amp; Technology Directorate. CCME focuses on developing the technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility, finally transitioning to the craft. The integration and procurement piece is managed by the individual Combatant Craft Program.

•  CCA utilizes various contracting and better buying power practices to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the craft’s current performance envelope.

•  TAS PM JTWS will perform market research to determine feasibility and appropriateness of conducting a full and open competition.  PM JTWS is planning a developmental effort in FY18/FY19 to mature existing technologies.  PM-SS will retain funds to support integration across the family of Combatant Craft.

•  MPE will be a full and open competition of the launcher systems with follow-on government-led integration effort leveraging lessons learned from similar rapid integration efforts on other combat tested SOF platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) relies on innovation to maintain our nation's ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict.  The Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx)  increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter.  Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIUx is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include "non-traditional" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016.  

DIUx mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, (USD, AT&amp;L) when it was established in July 2015.  In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) with a functional realignment of $148.8 million across the FYDP to WHS.

The DIUx program will fund the development of novel leading-edge technologies emerging from high-tech companies that are not traditional defense contractors.  An objective of this program is to obtain innovative ideas from industry that have low technology readiness and are of high priority to DoD leadership.  Incoming proposals will be assessed to ensure alignment with the DoD’s strategic objectives to increase and strengthen our nation’s security.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Secretary of Defense's strategic priorities includes improving the Departments lethality through multiple means to include the openness and willingness to evolve by adopting new ideas to ensure a better future for the Department and the Nation.  One of the tenets of this priority is to expand the Department's ability to access leading edge technological innovations through commercial partnerships.  The funding DIUx executes is critical as it incentivizes non-traditional defense sector companies to work with and invest in advancing DoD future capabilities.  

 Some of the projects undertaken include:  
- Hardened Network Defense that provides warfighters improved network security by obscuring vital services and data, thereby significantly decreasing the ability of advancing cyber threats to map, attack or exploit tactical systems.
- Command, Control, and Situational Awareness web-based software platform that supports user's ability to visualize relevant activities and operational metrics, collaboratively plan and approve defense activities, and monitor/manage subsequent.  DIUx projects signal investment targets for venture capital opportunities.  While these are small when compared to the DoD total budget, the 3rd party investment multiplier they generate are without equal.</r2:Text>

DIUx's objective is to rapidly solve the problems of our DoD customers and deploy those solutions.  Accordingly, DIUx requirements are driven by DoD customers in the Services, Defense Agencies, and Combatant Commands.  They come to DIUx with their most challenging and most compelling technological problems.  DIUx works to solve challenges and issues for the Department in areas such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Autonomy, Human Systems, Information Technology, and Space.  DIUX specialized staff carry out the niche functions of its three teams:   Venture, Foundry and Engagement.  The Venture team identifies emerging commercial technology and explores its military applicability.  The Foundry team works with technology that is still maturing and is not yet ready for production and the Engagement Team introduces entrepreneurs to military problems and the military to entrepreneurs.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Defense Digital Service (DDS) was launched in November 2015 and was formally chartered under DoD Directive 5105.87 in January 2017 in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) of the Department of Defense (DoD).  Since that time, OSD has presented over 100 potential projects to DDS, some of which would benefit significantly from the enhanced prototyping capabilities of DDS. With appropriate funding, DDS leverage, its private sector expertise to fully support the build of a system prototype / proof-of-concept. RDT&amp;E funding is required to support the DDS mission, which includes the ability to build software prototypes to prove out concepts for mission critical projects identified by the Department.

Ensuring that DDS has RDT&amp;E capabilities will increase DoD’s ability to leverage DDS’s unique technical expertise to determine which private sector software development best practices and/or technology work best for the Department. Furthermore, the development and testing of DDS prototypes, and the insight gained, would significantly lower development costs and delivery times through traditional DoD methods.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DDS was created to bring private sector software development best practices, talent, and technology to the Department’s hardest software and technology problems. Since its launch in November 2015, DDS has project demands from OSD that have increased exponentially; some of those requests would benefit from robust prototyping / proof-of-concept capabilities by DDS teams. The former is dependent on RDT&amp;E funding that supports the ability to acquire the most current technological solution and/or support from vendors well versed in the most advanced technological solutions.  

The requested RDT&amp;E funds will enable DDS to build prototypes and implement proof-of-concept tests for some key OSD projects. These projects will support missions in and out of theater, as well as long term goals of the department to modernize its offensive and defensive technological capabilities.  DoD interest in leveraging DDS to operate in this area to solve hard and impossible problems is persistent.  With appropriate funding, DDS can use the superior technical expertise of its staff, as well as ability to quickly deliver usable products to meet demand.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

With a team firmly rooted in the heart of the Pentagon, Defense Digital Service (DDS) serves as a nimble unit with the ability to quickly mobilize and tackle some the DoDs toughest technological challenges.  DDS's approach leverages industry best practices to efficiently navigate policy, contracts, and tech blockers to reach working and scalable solutions to hardware and software problems.  The ultimate goal of the team is to support DoD in finding and implementing relevant tech solutions to hard and/or impossible problems that when solved, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the department in carrying out its mission to defend the United States and its domestic and overseas interests.  Ultimately, the purpose and goal of the team is to ensure that solutions reach the hands of end users, including warfighters, in short timelines, so that compound problems from the existing problem sets do not persist.</r2:Text>

DDS requirements are driven by challenging technical problems identified by the Secretary of Defense where technology is failing the Department of Defense mission.  These problems span across classified and unclassified problem spaces, and range from software development, piloting the use of commercial software as a replacement for antiquated government systems, and modernizing and refactoring broken systems.  Some examples of current projects include: replacing the MEPCOM Integrated Resources System, reimagining the user interface and associated databases for the Defense Property System, devising a hard and software solution to counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems that attack warfighters in theater, and developing a novel and modern approach to network defense.  Our team is comprised of digital experts with backgrounds in policy, contracts, design, and engineering who collectively use their private industry and federal government experience to identify solutions to problems and rapidly devise and implement solutions.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     Approve component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS). 
-     Approve component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversee Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Report results of OT&amp;E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     Review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
 (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. 

DOT&amp;E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&amp;E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This effort is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities and is a continuing effort.  Funding for FY 2017 provides Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2017 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List. 

Cybersecurity Evaluations 

DOT&amp;E plans to sponsor approximately 10 CCMD and Service cybersecurity assessments and CRCs in FY 2017, each including a “fix” phase as described above.  DOT&amp;E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multi-year plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events.  These plans will focus on assessing the CCMD or Service’s ability to complete missions in a contested cyber environment.  To support threat-representative assessments, and to enable continuous improvement of DoD’s cybersecurity posture, DOT&amp;E will continue to work with U.S. Cyber Command to establish a PCO capability for all CCMDs and Services.  Primary objectives for DOT&amp;E’s assessments in FY 2017 include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks.  DOT&amp;E will assess Cyber Protection Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC or exercise events.  DOT&amp;E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, and conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities. DOT&amp;E will use the DoD Enterprise Cyber Range Environment (DECRE) and other lab and cyber range assets to support events, for added threat realism. DOT&amp;E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD’s cybersecurity posture.   FY 2017 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME).  

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies.  

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME). 

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Logistics Commanders' Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups (OUWG) input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. 

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The FY 2017 budget will support the Live Fire Test and Evaluation deputate’s assessment of  Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary reports, and the development of Live Fire Test and Evaluation reports for those programs designated for OSD oversight.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives

	The FY 2017 JLF budget will support at least 20 projects (tentatively 12 new starts and 8 projects continuing from previous FYs).  Focus areas for JLF include projects that either: 1) characterize new survivability issues; 2) characterize new lethality issues; 3) improve accuracy and fidelity of weapon data; 4) improve test methods; 5) improve modeling and simulation methods; or 6) develop vulnerability data libraries for emerging non-kinetic threats.

	JLF Air projects will continue to evaluate technologies and techniques to decrease vulnerabilities to all currently tested aircraft, against operationally relevant threats.  Previously initiated projects that will be continued include developing a model for the OG-7V fragmentation grenade, quantifying the penetration of armor piercing incendiary munitions, evaluating the effectiveness of CV-22 Wing Fire Protection Systems, and evaluating the vulnerability of engines to MANPADS.  New efforts will be initiated to (1) determine the root cause of CH-53 and CH-47 self-sealing bladder performance issues; (2) measure flammability traits of AH-64E Fire Detection Expansion Systems; and (3) develop a 12.7 x 108 mm Heat (High) Explosive Incendiary threat model prediction.

	JLF Ground projects will continue to optimize the mix of 30 mm ammunition, determine the fragment spray pattern and velocity for the MK84 warhead, and determine/mitigate collateral damage effects.  Several new efforts will be initiated to develop better test methodologies:  (1) develop instrumented inert warheads to mimic rocket-propelled grenade and anti-tank guided munitions; (2) develop better underbody blast threat and blast box analysis; and (3) develop improved instrumentation to assess local accelerative loading due to blast effects within armored vehicles.  One effort will improve modeling and simulation of buried underbody blast effects.  Finally, one effort will analyze statistical quantification of probability estimates of small caliber munitions in order to minimize the number of Live Fire tests required.

	JLF Sea projects include improving the modeling of simulation of equipment failure due to thermal effects, developing modeling tools for structural damage due to underwater explosions and their resulting bubble loading, and improving vulnerability hydrocodes by generating underwater explosion data that mimics multiple bubble pulsations.

	Live Fire initiatives will also include continued support of the execution and further development of a ground vehicle survivability course.

JASP

In FY 2017 the JASP will continue work on at least 28 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate 12 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness.  Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft.
The JCAT will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness

In FY17, JTCG/ME will continue to develop and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness, including target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and CCMDs’ needs. 

JTCG/ME will deploy and continue to enhance future versions of its two major JTCG/ME Joint Munitions JMEM products, the JWS and J-ACE. The JTCG/ME will continue to coordinate and develop a non-kinetic JMEM capability, leveraging its FY16 Cyber JMEM prototyping efforts. Additionally, JTCG/ME will field and coordinate new capabilities, such as the DIEE and DCiDE Collateral Damage Estimation. Beyond traditional JMEM products, JTCG/ME will continue to support specialized weaponeering data and solutions for Warfighter urgent requirements and support Users. This includes standalone resources such as the Pk Lookup Tools, CDE tables, and munitions weaponeering guides. The objective is to provide efficient and effective support to meet CCMD current and future needs for agility in a dynamic operational environment. 

The JTCG/ME will field JWS v2.3 in FY17. JWS v2.3 will include enhanced data sets and capabilities with focus on connectivity to other targeting and mission planning capabilities for improved estimates and more seamless planning inherent in the concept of operational agility. When fielded, this capability will continue to enable CCMDs to have operational targeting, weaponeering, and collateral damage estimation capability in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training. 

JTCG/ME will continue to facilitate coalition interoperability in FY17. It will supply several JWS version releases to key coalition partners in support of current operations under FMS agreements. FY17 efforts will enable the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Republic of Korea, and other coalition partners to plan operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimates, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses. This capability is critical to the effectiveness and synergy of U.S. targeting and fires personnel working in combined partnered environments.

JWS v2.4 will be the last in the JWS v2.x product line and will include enhanced and updated weapons and target data sets, improved Graphical User Interphases for improved business logic and human system interaction, and improved database designs for speed and updating. JWS v2.4 will also include FIST v2.1 with Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) v11.1, enhanced imagery, and enhanced Response Surface Mapping/ Penetration Launch Acceptability Region capabilities. JWS v2.4 will continue to address and implement CCMD requirements.

JTCG/ME will develop JWS v3.x product line open architecture construct. This will enable interactive scene base weaponeering, maximize re-use and interoperability of capabilities, increase speed of modeling and simulation, support future hardware/software compatibility, and support allied releasability. JWS v3.x efforts will include formulation and refinement of the Joint Effects Library (JEL), which will provide the modules for the open architecture. JWS v3.x is the next evolution of agile, scalable capability solutions to meet the needs of the Joint Force in a dynamic operational environment.

JTCG/ME will continue to support updates for DCiDE tools in FY17 to support the CJCSI 3160.01B – “No-Strike and the CDE Methodology”. JTCG/ME will update and the accredit CER Reference Tables for selected air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weapons, which are the basic data that supports the CDE methodology. Changes will include additional updates for newly fielded/updated systems, as well as new fragmentation and blast methodologies. JTCG/ME will also enhance and accredit improvements to the CEL Tool in support of advanced CDE mitigation techniques. 

JTCG/ME will field DIEE v2.0 with DPSS. The first fielded version of DIEE, v2.0, will integrate capabilities of an ELT, Precision Point Mensuration tool, and CDE tool, as well as other targeting applications in what we are calling an IDV. DIEE usage in Combatant Commands as their primary tool for full-integrated targeteering capability will continue to grow.

JTCG/ME will develop and integrate DIEE v2.1 in FY17, with expected release in FY18. DIEE v2.1 will include CGS update, CEL interface development, additional imagery formats, and increased Common Operating Picture information on IDV. DIEE enhancements will continue to provide agile capability solutions for the Joint Force Commander in dynamic operational environments.

JTCG/ME will field J-ACE v5.3 in FY17. J-ACE v5.3 will extend and update data sets for missile and aircraft target aero-performance, anti-air missile lethality, and air target vulnerability. The fielding of J-ACE v5.3 will allow greater aero performance options and the ability to estimate counter-measure effectiveness. A key enhancement of J-ACE v5.3 is the continued evolution of the J-ACE architecture to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing. 

JTCG/ME will continue to develop and progress to operational testing for J-ACE v5.4. J-ACE v5.4 will provide enhanced data, methodology, and descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and EM. The fielding of J-ACE v5.4 in FY18 will allow for greater outbrief capability and connectivity by units, target detection estimation, counter Air Defense prediction capability, and enhanced architecture allowing future version growth and compatibility. J-ACE will enhance PCDS capability, and further evaluate enhancement of aircraft maneuverability modeling with HIVE/BLUEMAX6. In addition, JAAM will include capability to evaluate two sided SEAD and DEAD; improved target detection capability leveraging NASIC IR and RF models; and multiple ESAMS capability. The J-ACE architecture will continue to be enhanced to maximize re-use, interoperability of capabilities, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing.

JTCG/ME will perform requirements analysis and plan for J-ACE v5.6 based on User requirements from working groups and training sessions to ensure alignment with User community. 

Joint Non‑Kinetic Effectiveness JMEMs are intended to be the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities and directed energy effectiveness.  

In FY17, JTCG/ME will continue to develop non-kinetic weaponeering tools and methodologies. JTCG/ME will continued to develop and mature the JMEM process for cyberspace operations and directed energy. FY17 efforts will build from FY16 that developed the foundational elements for JMEM production, including weapons characteristics, target vulnerability, and effects estimation tools. JTCG/ME will interact with the User community based on initial FY16 Cyber JMEM prototype. This will help with maturation process and further strengthen the foundation for a full J-NKE capability suite, to include other non-kinetic effects. JTCG/ME will continue to refine these initial efforts in FY17, with increased efforts in FY18.

Since JTCG/ME products are User focused and requirements driven, there is considerable effort that goes into working with Users to establish Warfighter requirements for on-going efforts and future JTCG/ME products. 

JTCG/ME will chair OUWGs. OUWGs are a critical venue for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support AS, SS, AA, and non-kinetic engagements. 

JTCG/ME will also continue User training on its products in FY17. With the fielding of new versions of JWS, DCiDE, DIEE, and J-ACE, there is an expected growth in training support requirements.  

JTCG/ME will provide help desk and training packages via the JPIAS, as well as product newsletters. 

JTCG/ME will also support urgent operational needs with specialized solutions, such as weapons fielded between product releases and need for urgent target vulnerability surrogations to support current operations.</r2:Text>

Capabilities will include updated weapons and targets and FIST v2.1 with inclusion and updates to WinBlast, Bridge Analysis System, Linear Target Module, and surface response and penetration functions in burst point editor.  These capabilities will enable more options to the Weaponeer and improve the underlying phenomenology representation in JWS.
- Continue development on the next JWS series (JWS v3.x).  JTCG/ME will leverage the JWS v3.x Capability Needs Statement (CNS) completed in FY17 to progress towards initial capability.  Specific efforts will include requirements analysis/decomposition, functionality/methodology review and gap analysis, development plan finalization, and endgame framework road mapping.
- Support current use and future development requirements, by hosting and supporting JWS training sessions, Operational Users Working Groups (OUWG), and User help via the JMEM Product Information Access System (JPIAS) and JWS newsletter.  The training sessions allow users to optimize use of JWS capabilities, while providing JTCG/ME with critical input on Warfighter use for future development.  OUWGs are critical venues for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support Air to Surface (AS) and Surface to Surface (SS).
- Continue to facilitate coalition interoperability and information exchange forums, by delivering JWS version releases and standalone Pk Lookup tools to key coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales agreements.  This capability improves the effectiveness of U.S. fires and targeting personnel working in combined environments.
- Continue to maintain and enhance the Collateral Effects Library (CEL) tool in support of advanced CDE mitigation techniques.  JTCG/ME will leverage CEL, along with other high fidelity techniques to deliver collateral damage mitigation analysis and tables to operational Users for high value targets and current operational planning.  These efforts directly assist Combatant Commands to meet commander’s intent and minimize collateral damage.
- Initiate multiyear plan, developed in FY17, to enhance and validate collateral damage.  The enhancement will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces, while not increasing risk of collateral damage by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools.  Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities to make their strike decision calls.  The FY18 efforts build off three FY17 JLF testing events and multiple collaboration forums.
- Field DIEE v2.1 that will include user requested enhancements, JWS interface, updated CGS for PPM capability, JTT read/write capability, CEL interface development, as well as additional supported image and layer management formatting.
- Continue to develop future DIEE versions (v2.2), which will include 3-D viewer capability and updates to connectivity interfaces.
- Continue to support the CJCSI 3160.01, by updating and accrediting CER Reference Tables for Air-to-Surface (AS) and surface-to-surface (SS) weapons, which are the basic data that support the CDE methodology.  The CER tables and CDE methodology are used in every planned kinetic strike in all Areas of Responsibility (AORs) to meet Commanders’ intent and to minimize civilian casualties.  As such, it is critical to the Warfighters ability to meet urgent operational needs.  DCiDE tool implements the latest CER and CDE methodology.  DCiDE is an accredited and automated CDE tool that expedites and simplifies the CDE process and is interconnected with DIEE.
- Continue to provide direct forward presence support to CCMDs, which enabled target materiel development, weaponeering and CDE solution development.
- Sustain DCiDE and DIEE training sessions for the Warfighter.
- Sustain/support fielded J-ACE v5.3.  Efforts will include multiple training and user forums for the fielded product.  These forums are pivotal for J-ACE developers to understand requirements and align development with other external debrief and analytical capabilities that use J-ACE as the underlying analytical engine to underpin results.  Many users leverage J-ACE’s API to link debrief and analysis tools at training and test ranges across the Joint community.  The forums allows J-ACE external application developers to receive an updates and interact with J-ACE developer to refine requirements and plans.
- Continue development and finalization of J-ACE v5.4, with expected fielding in FY19.  J-ACE v5.4 fielding will include an enhanced BROWSE module for descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and Endgame Manager.  In addition, it will facilitate greater connectivity for debrief capabilities, include initial capability to evaluate two sided SEAD/DEAD, target detection estimation by leveraging NASIC RF models, and increased counter air defense prediction with greater Enhanced Surface-to-Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS) capability.  An enhanced architecture will maximize re-use, interoperability, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing.
- Develop next J-ACE version series by finalizing requirements and implementing initial capabilities for rotary wing aircraft, as well increasing capability for SEAD/DEAD, electronic warfare, and counter-measures.
- Continue to develop J-NKE as the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities and directed energy effectiveness.  Specifically:
-- Execute a multiyear plan to build a Cyber JMEM capability to include standardization of data to address weapon characterization, target vulnerability, Operational Environment, and Uncertainty Metrics for the Cyber Operation Lethality and Effectiveness (COLE) tool.  Efforts will include solidifying relationships with key stakeholders, framework development, initial network modeling, standardize weapons and target characterization, codify/develop operational environment model, and determine uncertainty metrics and data standards.

The FY 2018 budget will enable the LFT&amp;E Deputate to: (1) assess the adequacy of programs’ test and evaluation plans and reports and generate new test and evaluation policies, as needed; (2) review and analyze the test data to support an independent evaluation of the survivability/lethality of the systems in support of the development of OSD Live Fire Test and Evaluation reports to Congress; and (3) review major acquisition plans, reports, and requirement documents to inform system design and capability development.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives 
The FY 2019 budget will support the planning and execution of tests of fielded systems not previously tested under the Live Fire
Programs to support DOT&amp;E and operator needs.  New threats, missions, TTPs, and combat environments will create the need for these tests and an assessment of performance.  JLF projects will be defined, planned, and executed to provide survivability and lethality data on currently fielded U.S. systems; improve modeling and simulation tools; develop vulnerability data libraries for emerging threats; and initiate responses to quick reaction requests from theater.

JASP

In FY 2019 the JASP will continue work on at least 20 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate about 8 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness. Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft. 
The JCAT will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness

In FY19, JTCG/ME will continue to develop and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness, including target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and CCMD needs.

The training sessions allows users to optimize use of JWS capabilities, while providing JTCG/ME with critical input on Warfighter use for future development.  OUWGs are critical venues for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regards to needed software enhancements and capabilities to support AS and SS.
- Continue to facilitate coalition interoperability and information exchange forums, by delivering JWS version releases and standalone Pk Lookup tools to key coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales agreements.  This capability improves the effectiveness of U.S. fires and targeting personnel working in combined environments.
- Continue to support the CJCSI 3160.01, by updating and accrediting CER Reference Tables for AS and SS weapons, which are the basic data that support the CDE methodology.  The CER tables and CDE methodology are used in every planned kinetic strike in all AORs to meet Commanders’ intent and to minimize civilian casualties.  As such, it is critical to the Warfighters ability to meet urgent operational needs.  DCiDE tool implements the latest CER and CDE methodology.  DCiDE is an accredited and automated CDE tool that expedites and simplifies the CDE process and is interconnected with DIEE.
- Field DIEE v2.2, which will include 3-D viewer capability, updates to connectivity interfaces, and greater format flexibility, while maintaining Warfighter support and future requirements through training and User forums.
- Continue to execute multiyear plan to enhance and validate collateral damage.  The enhancement will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces while not increasing risk of collateral damage by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools.  Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities to make their strike decision calls.
- Field J-ACE v5.4 that will include an enhanced BROWSE module for descriptive material to support new weapons in the JAAM and Endgame Manager.  In addition, it will facilitate greater connectivity for debrief capabilities, target detection estimation with NASIC RF modeling, counter air defense prediction with greater ESAMS capability, and  enhanced architecture to maximize re-use, interoperability, support future hardware/software compatibility, and optimize integration and validation testing.
- Develop the next J-ACE version that will include rotary wing aircraft, as well increasing capability for SEAD/DEAD electronic warfare, and counter-measures.  
- Continue to support and interact with the User base thru training and User/External Interface working group forums.  These forums are pivotal for J-ACE developers to understand requirements and align development with other external debrief and analytical capabilities that use J-ACE as the underlying analytical engine to underpin results.  Many users leverage J-ACE API to link debrief and analysis tools at training and test ranges across the joint community.  The EIWG meeting allows J-ACE external application developers to receive an updates and interact with J-ACE developer to refine requirements and plans. 
- Continue to develop J-NKE as the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze offensive cyber capabilities and directed energy effectiveness.  Specifically:
-- Mature Cyber JMEM capabilities with continued execution of multiyear plan.  FY19 efforts will build upon FY18 efforts.  Specific planned efforts include maintaining User community interaction and stakeholder partnerships, refining weapon/target standards, initial COLE capabilities, initial User beta testing, and integration of uncertainty analytics.
-- Mature DE effectiveness capabilities with continued execution of multiyear plan.  FY19 efforts will build upon FY18 outcomes, while continuing the work and leveraging of the FY18/19 Joint Test Project, JLaSE.  Leveraging and cooperation between JTCG/ME and JLaSE will facilitate lessons learned, data standards, methodology standards, and working relations imperative in the fruition of a DE effectiveness, weaponeering, and CDE solution for the Warfighter.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&amp;A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&amp;A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).

Joint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&amp;E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.   

Threat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&amp;E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&amp;E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  Threat Systems provides DOT&amp;E assessment officers and other DOT&amp;E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.

The Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) T&amp;E Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&amp;E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&amp;E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), weapon system developers, and the Services.  The Center’s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The Center develops unique CM/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines effectiveness of precision guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs.  Analysis and recommendations on CM/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&amp;E, DASD (DT&amp;E), and the Services.  The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM/CCM technology and capabilities.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY 2017 JT&amp;E plans on closing two projects that were started in FY 2015. One, the Joint Pre-/Post-Attack Operations Supporting Survivability &amp; Endurability Joint Test, expected to close in February 2017, will develop and test procedures for protective posturing and mobile support that will mitigate the effects of an electromagnetic-pulse on mission critical functions. The other project to close in FY 2017 is the Joint Advanced Sensor to Shooter Joint Test, which is looking to develop, test and evaluate tactics, techniques, and procedures to more efficiently and effectively gain and maintain battle space awareness through integration of rapidly developed capabilities to support combat operations in anti-access and active denial environments

Two projects that started in FY 2016 will continue through FY 2017.

Four new feasibility studies are expected to be conducted in FY 2017, two of which will be selected to conduct joint tests.

Threat Systems

In FY 2017, Threat Systems will continue test planning working group participation and perform technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions based on the availability of funding. Threat Systems will:

- Provide intelligence support to DOT&amp;E staff to address specific questions on threat systems affecting programs on the OSD T&amp;E Oversight list and provide briefings and special intelligence reports when necessary.
- Provide DOT&amp;E representative support at the Threat Steering Group (TSG) in the transitioning of the System Threat Assessment Reports (STARS) to the new Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) report process.
- Continue to represent DOT&amp;E interests on Acquisition/Intelligence/ Requirement Task Force (AIRTF) and Executive Steering Group (AIRESG) and provide access to the Intelligence Mission Data Management Analysis &amp; Reporting System (IMARS).  
- Support the US warfighter by providing threat intelligence to ensure operational and developmental testing occurs against realistic threat representations.
- Sustain and manage threat M&amp;S to support test and evaluation by overseeing and coordinating intelligence community developed threat models, performing threat model anomaly resolution resolving differences from live fire testing, integrating threat models into T&amp;E facilities and distributing performance and signature models to T&amp;E users.
- Review validation reports to independently ensure that correct threat data and critical parameters are presented in the report to assessment the threat representation’s capabilities to replicate a real world threat system.
- Continue identifying initiatives to improve cyberspace threat representation and prediction, cyber-economic threats to DoD systems, representative threat offensive and defensive cyber operations capabilities, and scalable cyberspace threat test environments that can interface with cyber test networks.
- Manage Integrated Technical Evaluation and Analysis of Multiple Sources (ITEAMS) efforts supporting programs on the OSD T&amp;E Oversight List by conducting intelligence “deep dives” to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets.
- Initiate new ITEAMS efforts leading to the development of new threat systems for T&amp;E.
- Represent DOT&amp;E at foreign material exchanges, inter-agency coordinating groups, and non-proliferation groups to raise awareness of T&amp;E needs for foreign material, coordinate service requirements, and de-conflict and prioritize foreign material requirements for T&amp;E.
- Represent DOT&amp;E at the Intelligence Mission Data Oversight Board responsible for development, production and sharing issues affecting the intelligence data supporting weapons systems acquisition.
- Oversee legacy DOT&amp;E investments and continue management and oversight of legacy and new Test Resource Management Center-funded threat system investments.

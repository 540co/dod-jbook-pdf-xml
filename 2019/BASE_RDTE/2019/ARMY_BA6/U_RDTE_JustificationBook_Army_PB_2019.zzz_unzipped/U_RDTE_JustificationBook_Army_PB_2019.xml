            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the design, development, acquisition, integration and fielding of realistic mobile threat simulators and realistic threat simulation products utilized in Army training and developmental and operational tests. This PE originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, but scope was expanded to address emerging world threats. Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories and hardware/simulation in-the-loop facilities. These battlefield simulators represent adversary systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) in order to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems.

Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products developed or fielded under this PE support Army-wide, non-system-specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army and tri-service capabilities to eliminate duplication of effort. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and Government Accountability Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) Threat Simulator Investment Working Group.

Beginning in Fiscal Year 2019, this PE will also support the Advanced Electronic Support Sensor Suite (AESSS) and Cyber Blue Teams activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Cyber Blue Teams refer to the cyber team which works cooperatively with the system owner to ensure programs can defend against attackers and/or Red Teams. These Cyber Blue Team capabilities are essential to enable military operators to assess and defeat the presence of cyber security threats across Army networks. PM ITTS will also serve as the primary point of contact for cyber-related testing and vulnerabilities assessments with U.S. Cyber Command and Army Cyber. This Project executes the establishment and management of certification standards for Acquisition Blue Teams and coordination of Blue Team requirements on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA ALT).</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aerial Targets Project supports Army readiness through development, acquisition, operation and modernization of aerial targets. Multi-spectral Aerial Targets include realistic surrogates, actual high performance threat aircraft, and virtual target computer models. Current and emerging weapons systems require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess weapons systems effectiveness in the operational environment. This program encompasses a portfolio of full-scale, miniature, and subscale fixed wing/rotary wing targets, virtual targets, ancillary devices, and associated control systems. For accurate threat portrayal that properly stresses weapons systems during test and evaluation aerial targets must exhibit the flight characteristics, threat signatures, and other performance factors to represent or emulate relevant and validated threats. This Project resources the long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirements; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation, production, and modernization; execution of the validation process to ensure that aerial targets accurately represent the threat; as well as storage and repair parts. The Army is the Test Enterprise Reliance lead for Rotary Wing Targets and Towed Target development and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing High Speed Aerial Target.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The objective of the Mobile Ground Target Operations (MGTO) effort is to support the testing community as fully, efficiently and effectively as possible.  The MGTO centrally manages a fleet of foreign threat ground vehicles while maintaining the foreign integrity of the assets.  The MGTO provides support and oversight for actual threat foreign ground vehicles and mobile ground target surrogate vehicles for use as threat targets by the T&amp;E community for destructive and non-destructive scenarios. Efforts will support users such as ATEC, Apache 64E, GMLRS, Brigade Modernization Command, KIOWA, JAGM, Gray Eagle, Add PM Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV), and others.</r2:Text>

This PE also funds development and acquisition of Operational Test Command's (OTC) major field instrumentation and the management of the Cyber Acquisition Blue Team program and certification standards. Requirements for instrumentation and cyber certifications are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems. Army testing facilities are also surveyed to determine major testing capability shortfalls.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds improvement and modernization (I&amp;M) for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS). Funds modernization of the radar, telemetry, optics, range safety, communications, command/control and other equipment essential to meet test and evaluation requirements of the Services and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. Without modernization these instrumentation systems face obsolescence or degraded capability. The RTS instrumentation is required to support data collection for test &amp; evaluation assessments and operational decisions for the Army, Navy, Air Force, United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other customers. RTS, located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). 

Funding will enable RTS to continue to meet customer objectives and sustain the required instrumentation suite.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The ROSA Refresh plan is to incorporate subsystem technologies into the Ground-Based Radar Prototype (GBR-P), then transition those technologies to the other RTS sensors. Much of the testing and integration lessons will be learned ahead of time, providing a drop-in updated solution for legacy ROSA components at the other radars identified as having long-term sustainability issues. In this approach, the ROSA refresh effort is coupled with the GBR-P modernization leading to a cleaner and more cost-effective program.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This activity will develop the technology required to modernize the telemetry systems using an innovative software defined radio approach designed to vastly improve the ability to adapt to future telemetry changes and requirements quickly with lower cost. In addition, this approach will enable centralized command and control of the telemetry equipment increasing efficiency in mission preparation and execution. The telemetry backend processing chain is currently comprised of discrete frequency-specific hardware components that are replicated for each telemetry channel required for a test event. This activity will develop a scalable frequency-agnostic, software-based solution that runs on commodity computer servers. More complex missions (e.g., Over-the-air (OTA) operational testing of the Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS)) will continue to require more telemetry channels, but this activity will avoid much of that future cost. This effort will provide enough hardware to increase capacity of the telemetry system.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>As missions become more complex and challenging, operator workload increases significantly. This activity improves automation and decision support to reduce human operator workload and operator errors associated with a higher workload. There will be additional capabilities to operate the range as a cohesive meta-sensor with capabilities to program contingencies, react with a priori information and decision algorithms and resource brokers. This will improve mission assurance. The RTS radar control software will be upgraded to automate processes that computers do better than humans, and reduce the need for labor intensive tuning efforts. The human computer interface (HCI) for the radars will be improved to allow operators to interact with the RTS sensor suite more intuitively with a small set of high-level commands. The control center data fusion algorithms will be improved and streamlined to reduce complexity and decrease operator workload.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops and acquires major test instrumentation to perform developmental testing of weapon systems at U. S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities which include: Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), AZ; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL.

Projects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total Project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These Projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team. FY19 funds will be used for modernization of outdated instrumentation in support of developmental testing for Army Department of Defense programs.

Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems. This Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items. Nuclear Effects Test Capabilities Modernization acquires and upgrades Special Test Equipment for nuclear facilities located at WSMR. These acquisitions and upgrades include the Pulse Current Injection Simulator, Prompt Gamma Simulator, Gamma Range Facility, Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC), Semi-Conductor Test Lab, Electromagnetic Pulse and the Solar Furnace. Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users. Test Network Modernization (TNM) will upgrade existing test data networks to ensure infrastructures are capable of providing reliable and secure transport of data and communications for ATEC test activities. Applied Environments Modernization (AEM) program will upgrade antiquated Environmental labs for climatic and dynamic testing with new cascade refrigeration units, climatic chambers, vibration test systems, x-ray cameras, a real-time radiography system and full spectrum solar lights. Future Wireless Network program (FWN) will procure and integrate wireless network technologies across ATEC test activities which will provide near real-time data collection support for Developmental Test and Operational Test events. Robotics/Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Instrumentation Suite will develop and procure instrumentation for testing controlled and autonomous ground and aerial robotic systems. System of Systems Cooperative Engagement Test Infrastructure (SCETI) will provide for the development of systems to conduct systems-level Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) testing for both aircraft and ground systems in a distributed environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the development, acquisition, and integration of major operational test instrumentation for the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's Operational Test Command and supporting test activities at test and training ranges. Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems. Project focus is to address Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E)-identified Army test realism shortfalls.

FY19 funds will be used for Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) in support of PM Apache, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Rifleman Radio.

Projects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.

The DOT&amp;E annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army's abilities to create realistic operational environments. The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE) project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&amp;E. ILTE is a portfolio of related development efforts that will deliver a system of systems to provide a Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) and instrumentation suite that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments. ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan. ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future weapon systems in a realistic operational environment. ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning System (GPS), encryption components, and integrate operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield. Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles. This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs), M1A2 Abrams, M2A4 Bradley, Stryker, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Apache AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) develops modern instrumentation radars to replace obsolete tracking and surveillance radars at U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's Developmental Test Command (DTC) activities which include: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ. The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army critical testing data essential for the development of complex next generation technology and advanced system capabilities. The RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability. The planned solution to meet program requirements consists of four primary items: Long Range Single Object Tracking Radars (SOTR), Long Range Multiple Object Tracking Radars (MOTR), Medium Range Radars (MRR), and Short Range Radars (SRR). The resulting system will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, RTC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers.

The Project will procure Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and/or Modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) radars for both the MRR and SRR solutions, and a combination of recapitalization and COTS/MOTS replacement for the FPS-16 Long Range Radars. Also, the program will conduct EMD for upgrading three MPS-39 Long Range MOTRs.

Fiscal Year 2019 funds the procurement and testing of COTS Medium Range Radars as replacement equipment to ATC, RTC,WSTC and YTC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin (WIAMan) Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) Project will develop and produce Warrior-representative ATDs that incorporate realistic, biomechanically-validated injury features and assessment tools to better characterize dynamic events and injury risks measured in Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) and vehicle development efforts. This capability is comprised of an ATD system built for the Title 10 LFT&amp;E environment and associated biomechanics data and analysis tools.  The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with underbody blast (UBB) events.  Consequently, current LFT&amp;E crew survivability assessment devices are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events.  Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for Under Body Blast (UBB) events.  The device produced by this Project will be used to satisfy a critical need for scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB. 

Other Program Funding Summary: Biomechanical research supporting WIAMan is funded by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), R-1 Program Element PE 0603115DHA/Medical Technology Development Project 431A / Underbody Blast Testing (Army) (FY2018, $8M).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds the RAND Arroyo Center, the Department of the Army's Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) for studies and analysis.  The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or Senior Executive Service (SES) equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the RAND Arroyo Center, the Department of the Army's Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) for studies and analysis. The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines. Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in three major research areas: Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Forces and Logistics; and Personnel, Training, and Health. The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid/long-term concerns. Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues. Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands. The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology). The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan. Each project requires General Officer (or Senior Executive Service (SES) equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) is unique in the Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) portfolio due to the comprehensive scope of RDTE funding at Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll, directly supporting 11 leased islands with radars, telemetry, and optics in support of 24/7 New Foreign Launch surveillance, space surveillance, space object identification, offensive and defensive strategic ballistic and interceptor missile testing. In addition, responsibilities include provision of the totality of the logistics and municipal services required to maintain a strategically vital mission support infrastructure in a remote Pacific island chain 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii. Kwajalein's flexible frequency spectrum, equatorial locale, deep water, and the Department of Defense's (DoD) only land-impact missile testing site, coupled with unmatched instrumentation, make the nation's space and missile operations possible.  

The United States (U.S.) Army Kwajalein Atoll/Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (USAKA/RTS), located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) supported by U.S. Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA). USAKA/RTS supports test and evaluation of major Army and DoD missile and space acquisition programs and provides new foreign launch surveillance, space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), US Air Force, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs. USAG-KA provides Base Operations (BOS), Infrastructure and Services (DW7/8/9) support to the USAKA/RTS mission and other resident Programs (i.e. Army missile defense, Air Force &amp; Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Air Force Space Fence, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational /demonstration/ validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and space experiments). Base Operations Services at Kwajalein Atoll are conducted predominantly through a contracted workforce with governmental oversight. These PE-funded contracts provide: installation/base operations and maintenance for all facilities, logistics, and security; power generation fuel supporting the installation and radars; transportation; and mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optic cable system. 

The Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) utilizes Project DX2 to provide civilian pay, manpower service contracts, supporting Information Technology (IT), equipment, and associated costs specifically identified and measurable to plan, manage, coordinate, and execute Information Technology Services Management at Army Kwajalein Test Ranges. This Project provides C4IM services in accordance with the Department of Army Pamphlet (DA PAM) PAM 25-1-1 and the Army C4IM Services List.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Concepts Experimentation Program Element (PE) supports current and future concepts and capabilities involving Soldiers and Leaders within live, virtual, and constructive environments by exploring concepts, capability requirements and solution across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains in order to learn and mitigate risk for current and future forces. Experiments and projects inform the Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army. Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force. Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) will integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.

Enables Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capability Development and Integration Directorates (CDID)/TRADOC Capability Managers (TCM) Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development to support Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT)) organizational community of PEOs/PMs supplemented manpower shortfalls to TRADOC for many years. This was necessary to ensure work affecting their materiel development programs, specifically the mandated JCIDS process necessary for Milestone acquisition Army Requirements Oversight Council/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (AROC/JROC) decisions, was executed in a timely manner. Funding ensures TRADOC acts independently as the voice of the warfighter, the user, in complement with the materiel developer in providing total capability management including integration of all DOTMLPF consideration for warfighting functional areas. Provides for TRADOC to serve as the lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs enabling development and deployment/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force. Early Synthetic Prototyping enables wargaming, experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions. Enables TRADOC to serve as the central coordinating organization for Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) staff support requirements related to accelerated capabilities developments and integrate accelerated capabilities development activities between proponent force modernization domains to include Joint/Service coordination. Provides Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA), which will allow TRADOC to physically integrate, assess and evaluate the network, capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. Provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) that are used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration.

The Soldier-Centered Analysis For Future Force will provide early application of human performance and human figure modeling tools in the development of Soldier-focused requirements to shape technology for Future Force development. Design analyses, constructive simulations and Soldier-in-the loop assessments will ensure that manpower requirements and workload and skill demands are considered to avoid information and physical task overloads, and take optimum advantage of aptitudes, individual and collective training, and numbers of Soldiers for an affordable Future Force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Directed SIMEX leverage unique support analytics which capture Soldier and Team interaction during virtual small unit, first-person operating environment events from shooter engagements to high tempo teaming events which will become the focus to integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs, and Capabilities to support Force 2025B Maneuvers to develop, refine, and validate prerequisite Force 2025 and Beyond Concepts, Operational and Organization Plans, and DOTMLPF solutions to achieve the vision of the Army's Force in the near (2014-2020), mid (2020-2030)(( and far (2030-2040) terms. Empowers participants to explore innovative techniques and participate in equipment and material design options which enables the Maneuver Battle Lab to be innovative in partnering with Department of Defense (DoD) Research and Development organizations in the development of solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges that would be assessed through Army Experimentation assessments. Leverages design of a high echelon, strategy environment which examines how units organize and employ future capabilities on the battlefield. The Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) continues, through a distributive network capability to support the Army Level Acquisition Design and merge with the Experimentation Mission while leveraging and sharing the expense of the Battle Labs to interject a new dynamic interactive process into proponent mission to engage Soldiers to select academia and industry solutions into a research opportunity through virtual exploration of the introduced concepts and equipment throughout a simulated operational environment selected from any location in the world. As Soldiers explore new ideas, concepts, material, and doctrine, they employ new techniques in coordination with the development of requirements documents provide improved insight to environment solutions to techniques and material during the conceptual development stage rather than post construction.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, this Program Element (PE) funds labor for physical security civilian guards and equipment as well as the UH-60 helicopters. Beginning in FY18, this PE will fund the Network Enterprise Center (NEC), Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP), and airfield operations, which were previous funded by the Operations and Maintenance - Army (OMA) appropriation.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides the institutional funding required to operate test activities, in accordance with Public Law 107-314 Section 232 in support of Department of Defense (DoD) Program Executive Officers, Program and Product Managers, and Research, Development, and Engineering Centers. Resources provided by this project operate six elements of the DoD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB): White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Centers (TRTC) at various locations. This PE also funds the Army's test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.

This PE finances the overhead (institutional) test operating costs not billable to DoD test customers per Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 3200.18 and Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DODFMR) 7000.14-R, which include recurring test infrastructure/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization/upgrade projects to maintain $5,500 Million of testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances. The test capabilities at these ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, cyber, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.

This PE sustains the T&amp;E capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies. Types of systems scheduled for testing include: Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Mission Command Network, and Tactical Command, Control, and Communication.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Fiscal Year 2017 Congressional Add (CA) includes a $10 million program increase for Army Test and Evaluation Command Developmental Test Technology &amp; Sustainment along with $10 million for "Cybersecurity of space and missile defense assets." Cybersecurity CA funds are being utilized by Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) to develop test technologies and capabilities necessary to address developmental test needs. Specifically, SMDC will use these funds to develop three fundamental technologies: 1.) a system analysis tool capable of assessing vulnerabilities of SMDC key terrain, 2.) Cyber Operational Risk Tool Suite (CORTS) capabilities to test network robustness, and 3.) developing the necessary live, virtual, and constructive test environment as well as the capabilities for test controls.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides critical front-end investments for development of new test methodologies, test standards, advanced test technology concepts for long range requirements, future test capabilities, and advanced instrumentation prototypes for subordinate commands of the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). These capabilities are required to support developmental testing requirements of high priority Army systems supporting Army modernization efforts. Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing.  A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This Project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems, upgrades to existing radars to extend their economic life, common data collection and analysis tools, non-intrusive instrumentation to test Unmanned Ground Vehicles and sensors, high speed - high definition digital imaging systems to capture missile flight events, and automation software to improve data collection of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) plans, conducts and reports on operational tests, assessments and experiments in order to provide essential information for the acquisition and fielding of War Fighting Systems. Operational Test (OT) Modeling Simulation and Instrumentation (MS&amp;I) collects required data from systems under test and the systems which they integrate with to  support effectiveness, survivability, and suitability analysis; these systems also provide real-time position location and status tracking to support test control. The Army's Operations Tempo (OPTEMPO) has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making enhancement of live forces through simulation essential for testing in a realistic, operational environment by simulating tactical engagements, additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain. ATEC OT MS&amp;I 62C funding is used to adapt capabilities from other organizations (including within ATEC), purchase off-the-shelf systems, and develop and sustain OT-unique simulation and instrumentation systems. As required, the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development and integration of major simulation and instrumentation systems such as Integrated Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE). The MS&amp;I (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds analytical products necessary for the inherently-governmental Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command/Army Evaluation Center (ATEC/AEC) mission. Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest-priority Army systems, whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions. While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this PE are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.

Developed through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), ATEC uses the products funded by this PE in many ways to make the Army force more survivable. This PE provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization. Products concern: Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command and communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role. Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items, including protective equipment such as helmets and vests. These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight. Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally-needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.

Survivability analyses funded by this PE are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include: guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; Cybersecurity and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons. This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces. Survivability data and analysis results funded by this PE are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's Army Regulation (AR) 5-5 studies process. Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally-mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability. Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this PE to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability, to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement, and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the Headquarters' Department of the Army (HQDA) Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (G1) Human Systems Integration (HSI) program. United States (U.S.) Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this PE to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements, and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics. Also, the quantitative analytical results funded by the PE are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders. Finally, for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues, data and analysis funded by this PE are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.   
 
This PE also supports Cybersecurity survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology. Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks, air defense and other systems. In conjunction with PMs and Army intelligence agencies, this PE also analyzes technical vulnerabilities of foreign weapons, network related systems, and intelligence Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to U.S. Army EW systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds analytical products necessary for inherently-governmental Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command/Army Evaluation Center's (ATEC/AEC) mission. Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions. Developed through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), the products funded by this Project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable. The Project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems. Products concern: Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command and communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role. Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests. These survivability products are leveraged where possible into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight. Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.

Survivability analyses funded by this Project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; cybersecurity and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons. This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces. Survivability data and analysis results funded by this Project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army regulation (AR) 5-5 studies process. Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability. Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this Project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability, to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement, and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 Human Systems Integration (HIS) program. United States (U.S.) Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this Project to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements, and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics. Also, the quantitative analytical results funded by the Project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders. When the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this Project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations. Finally, for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues, data and analysis funded by this Project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.   
 
This Project also supports highly technical cyber survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology. Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks, air defense and other systems. In conjunction with PMs and Army intelligence agencies, analyzes technical vulnerabilities of foreign weapons, network related systems, and intelligence Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to U.S. Army EW systems. Provides survivability analysis to System of Systems Network Vulnerability Assessments, to Chief Information Office (CIO) G6, Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), to triad (the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC), ATEC, and the System of Systems Integration (SoSI) Directorate.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Airworthiness Certification Program Element (PE) ensures safe flight operation of Army aircraft and aviation systems by means of technical design approval and qualification of systems to appropriate airworthiness standards. This PE provides independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62, and is essential for ensuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This PE performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems. This PE also provides management/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support to the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEO AVN) and the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO), the Army's Special Operations Aircraft program office, in developing requirements for major development/modification and for any future systems/subsystems; and management of the test and evaluation process in support of the airworthiness qualification process. The Airworthiness Certification PE also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models. Current ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification include: PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems including Longbow Apache E-model; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and modified Shadow UAS. Additionally, the Airworthiness Certification PE supports application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including Aircraft Survivability Equipment (e.g. Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband avionics and Tactical Radio Systems and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker). Project 092 also provides: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS)); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects (e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Airworthiness Certification Project ensures safe flight operation of Army aircraft and aviation systems by means of technical design approval and qualification of systems to appropriate airworthiness standards. It provides independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62, and is essential for ensuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This Project performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems. This Project also provides management/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support to the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEO AVN) and the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO), the Army's Special Operations Aircraft program office, in developing requirements for major development/modification and for any future systems/subsystems; and management of the test and evaluation process in support of the airworthiness qualification process. This Project also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models. Current ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification include: PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems including Longbow Apache E-model; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and modified Shadow UAS. Additionally, the Airworthiness Certification program supports application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including Aircraft Survivability Equipment (e.g. Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband avionics and Tactical Radio Systems and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker). This Project also provides: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects (e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides meteorological support to research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) activities and provides standard and specialized weather forecasts and data to satisfy Army/Department of Defense (DoD) RDTE test requirements for modern weaponry, such as: (1) unique atmospheric analysis and sampling to include atmospheric transmittance, extinction, optical scintillation, infrared temperature, aerosol/smoke cloud dispersion characteristics, and ballistic meteorological measurements; (2) test event forecasting to include prediction of sound propagation for ballistic firing tests, specialized prediction of light levels and target to background measurements, and predictions for electro-optical testing and ballistic artillery/mortar firing; and (3) advisory and warning products such as go/ no-go test recommendations for ballistic and atmospheric probe missiles, smoke/obscurant tests, hazard predictions for chemical agent munitions disposal, monitoring dispersion of simulant clouds for chemical/biological detector tests, simulated nuclear blasts, and weather warnings for test range safety. The PE provides technical weather support to Army and Joint Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at: White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This PE develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army/DoD RDTE requirements. It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers and replacement/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems. Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel/weapons developers and project/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R, October 1999. This PE enables more effective test scheduling and execution, and is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental and operational test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds Department of the Army (DA) civilians at the United States (U.S.) Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) to conduct responsive and effective materiel systems analysis in support of senior Army decision making for equipping the U.S. Army. AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design, development, fielding, and sustainment of Army weapon/materiel systems. As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies system level performance data used in Army studies, and develops item-level performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&amp;S).  

AMSAA exercises Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating, and accrediting item-level performance data and M&amp;S for combat effects and logistics. This includes the development and maintenance of common data formats.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems. Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, personnel and vehicle survivability, mobility, and system reliability. AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies. AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as: Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost/performance trade-offs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses; cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation. These analyses are used by leadership within HQDA (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); Army Materiel Command; Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers/Project Managers; and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD). AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier, along with enhancing and sustaining readiness for the Current and Future Force. 

AMSAA's M&amp;S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment. AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements. This M&amp;S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for the readiness of the Current and Future Force.  

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development. In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and life cycle management. AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprints and life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment. AMSAA's electronic and mechanical PoF program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process. AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations, resulting in improved reliability, reduced Operating and Support costs, and reduced logistics expenditures and footprints. AMSAA, in conjunction with the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), has formed the Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), which develops critical tools, methodologies, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials needed to help acquisition programs to achieve their required reliability during the acquisition process. The reliability improvements achieved for major weapon systems will translate into billions of dollars in operating and support cost savings over the life cycle.

AMSAA's unique analytical capabilities are supporting AEC to assess and determine the essential analytical requirements to enhance Army evaluations and reduce extensive testing. AMSAA's support in this area improves evaluation products and results in better materiel solutions to the Warfighter. AMSAA assists in systems evaluations which support various Acquisition Category (ACAT) materiel system decisions, and provides quick response analyses in support of rapid initiatives for Current Operations.

As the Army's center for materiel systems analysis, AMSAA provides the technical capability to support Army and DoD decision makers throughout the entire acquisition process in responding to analytical requirements across the full spectrum of materiel. AMSAA's unique in-house, consistent, integrated analytical capability is a critical asset that provides Army leadership with timely, independent, unbiased, reliable, and high quality analysis to support complex decisions required for Current Operations and the development of the Future Force (Strategic Portfolio Analysis Review (SPAR), Force 2025 and beyond). AMSAA's integrated set of skills and tools are focused on its core mission to develop and deliver systems analysis requirements critical in supporting Army decisions which will enable and sustain Materiel Readiness to meet the needs of the Warfighter.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This includes directly participating in and providing analytical products for Army Requirements Oversight Councils (AROCs) and Army Systems Acquisition Review Councils (ASARCs) to assist senior leaders in key acquisition strategy and life cycle decisions for a variety of materiel systems/programs. AMSAA will also provide analytical support to modify Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) planning efforts, reduce testing through the use of modeling and simulation, and provide software reliability and analysis capabilities to support T&amp;E. Further, AMSAA will conduct follow-on studies for major Army programs undergoing engineering change proposals and continue to provide essential certified weapons system performance data for all major Army studies. AMSAA?s technical work program relating to Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) (providing analytic input and certified data, as well as leading specified AoAs), Business Case Analyses, Cost Benefit Analyses, and Risk Assessments will continue at a high level (similar to fiscal year (FY) 2016 and FY2017). In addition to support for ACAT 1 and ACAT 2 programs, AMSAA is anticipating an increase in analytical support to Army ACAT 3 and ACAT 4 systems due to budget restrictions and financial limitations. AMSAA will continue efforts in support of the Army Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), as well as efforts on current operations related tasks, analyses, and model enhancements. AMSAA will continue to enhance its comprehensive set of system performance data and essential verified and validated item/system level methodologies, tools, and models and simulations to conduct materiel system performance analysis. AMSAA?s analysis capabilities and products will enable Senior Leaders to properly shape and influence acquisition policy, procedures, and materiel solutions and increase readiness for our Current and Future Force.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, Army Joint Test Element (JTE) was realigned from Program Element (PE) 0605898A (Management HQ - R&amp;D) / Project M65 (Army Test and Evaluation Command) to PE 0605712A (Support of Operational Testing) / Project 001 (ATEC Joint Tests And Follow-On Test and Eval).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides resources to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to operate the Army Joint Test Element (JTE) and the Army's Operational Test Command (OTC). JTE examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies' mission gaps, tactics and doctrine, resulting in the development of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and assessment documents. Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. OTC conducts independent operational tests that provide significant data to Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts. This PE finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This Project finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.  

OTC consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), Limited User Test (LUT), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE). OTC conducts operational tests required by public law (Title 10 USC 2399) that provide significant data to the Army decision makers on key Army systems and concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides the resources to operate the Army Evaluation Center (AEC) which is responsible for all assigned developmental and independent operational evaluation of Army materiel, information and acquisition systems, an inherently governmental mission. AEC assists the Chief of Staff of the Army decision making process by supporting the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) and the Strategic Portfolio Analysis Review (SPAR) processes. AEC determines impacts to readiness through Human Systems Integration (HSI), Unit Systems Integration (USI), and Army Systems Integration (ASI), DOTMLPF-P impacts, integrated suitability reviews (ISR) and operational suitability reviews (OSR) in partnership with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Policy and Logistics (DASA APL). AEC evaluates ballistics survivability and lethality missions, adversarial assessments/threat computer network operations, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (CVPA) and electronic warfare (EW) (attack, support) countermeasures in support of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2016 Section 1647, Establishment of Cybersecurity and Electromagnetic Affects (CEMA).  AEC manages, plans, and executes Information Assurance (IA) operational assessments during annual Combatant Command and Army Service exercises in support of the congressionally mandated Office of the Secretary of Defense Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD DOT&amp;E) assessment, and performs the operational test agency (OTA) duties for the Ballistic Missile Defense System.

This PE funds direct civilian labor and minimum non-labor requirements to include: Temporary Duty (TDY), personnel training, career development, supplies and equipment, hardware, software, and other external Other Government Agency (OGA) support as well as methodology development required to evaluate emerging technologies and instrumentation requirements.

AEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Evaluation Directorate (funded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Evaluation Directorate, Integrated Suitability &amp; Methodology Directorate, Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate, Soldier &amp; Support System Evaluation Directorate and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a headquarters element.  AEC receives staff services from the Army Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters (ATEC HQ).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides the resources to operate the Army Evaluation Center (AEC) which is responsible for all assigned developmental and independent operational evaluation of Army materiel, information and acquisition systems, an inherently governmental mission. AEC assists the Chief of Staff of the Army decision making process by supporting the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) and the Strategic Portfolio Analysis Review (SPAR) processes. AEC determines impacts to readiness through Human Systems Integration (HSI), Unit Systems Integration (USI), and Army Systems Integration (ASI), DOTMLPF-P impacts, integrated suitability reviews (ISR) and operational suitability reviews (OSR) in partnership with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Policy and Logistics (DASA APL). AEC evaluates ballistics survivability and lethality missions, adversarial assessments/threat computer network operations, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (CVPA) and electronic warfare (EW) (attack, support) countermeasures in support of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 16 Section 1647, Establishment of Cybersecurity and Electromagnetic Affects (CEMA).  AEC manages, plans, and executes Information Assurance (IA) operational assessments during annual Combatant Command and Army Service exercises in support of the congressionally mandated Office of the Secretary of Defense Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD DOT&amp;E) assessment, and performs the operational test agency (OTA) duties for the Ballistic Missile Defense System.

This Project funds direct civilian labor and minimum non-labor requirements to include: Temporary Duty (TDY), personnel training, career development, supplies and equipment, hardware, software, and other external Other Government Agency (OGA) support as well as methodology development required to evaluate emerging technologies and instrumentation requirements. 

AEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Evaluation Directorate (funded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Evaluation Directorate, Integrated Suitability &amp; Methodology Directorate, Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate, Soldier &amp; Support System Evaluation Directorate and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a headquarters element.  AEC receives staff services from the Army Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters (ATEC HQ). The primary competencies of these directorates is to: independently evaluate effectiveness, suitability, survivability; determine if Program Management (PM) and user directed requirements are met; direct the test strategy; and verify system safety.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) promotes the Army's Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) strategy, defined by five guiding priorities: (1) formulate Army M&amp;S policies; (2) develop and employ management processes for models, simulations and data; (3) develop M&amp;S standards, architectures, networks and environments; (4) develop/employ new M&amp;S tools and simulation technology; (5) develop an M&amp;S workforce. Specifically, this PE focuses on priorities 3 and 4.

M&amp;S Standards, Architectures, Networks and Environments: The consistent use of standards, architectures, networks and environments advances the goal of interoperability. The Army coordinates with Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) partners along with industry and academia to develop/employ standards that promote collaboration and facilitate the sharing of tools, data and information. The Army oversees procedures and processes for the appropriate use of standards to foster common formats and increase M&amp;S and data reuse. The Army ensures these standards, architectures, networks and environments are readily accessible and can be reliably applied by users.

M&amp;S Tools and Simulation Technology: The Army must have credible M&amp;S tools and data to support the full range of Army organizational missions and functional responsibilities. M&amp;S results that are timely and credible enhance decision making. The Army must develop and accredit reliable M&amp;S tools so that decision makers and senior leaders benefit from the results and thus support the continued development, integration and use of such tools. To ensure credibility and reliability of results, M&amp;S managers, developers and users must make the capabilities, constraints, limitations and assumptions of their M&amp;S tools readily accessible. PE 0605718A provides for the development and employment of tools in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making. Moreover, these tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose in order to provide timely, credible results.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Function 1 (Priority 3 of the "Army Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) Strategy") -- Develop M&amp;S standards, architectures, networks and environments that promote sharing, interoperability, access, and reliable application of tools, formats, data and information among/for users.

Function 2 (priority 4 of the "Army M&amp;S Strategy") -- Develop and improve tools and technology in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making.  These tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose.  

Resources under Project S03 support the six M&amp;S communities (Acquisition, Analysis, Experimentation, Intelligence, Test &amp; Evaluation, Training) at the enterprise level through enabling efforts. These efforts include the following: (a) design models, simulations, data and tools that are resident within one organization but reusable and trusted by M&amp;S users and specialists across the Army M&amp;S enterprise; (b) leverage industry and academia; (c) promote interoperability within M&amp;S and between M&amp;S and operational capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides funding for authorized civilian workforce performing medical research, development, acquisition management and oversight that support the medical research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) programs at the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, Maryland to: (1) perform planning, programming, and budgeting; (2) manage resources; and (3) ensure compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory and safety requirements. It also provides for continued operations of contracting and acquisition management functions performed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the USAMRMC Medical RDTE Program.    
    
Additionally, this Project provides funding for the special immunization program (SIP). The SIP program provides FDA licensed vaccines and investigational new drug (IND) vaccines under informed consent to laboratory workers at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and to other military, government, or contractor personnel who may be at risk of exposure to highly hazardous pathogenic microorganisms or toxins.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports upgrading the accuracy, timeliness, availability, and accessibility of scientific, technical, and management information at all levels of the Army Research and Development (R&amp;D) community. Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership. Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues. This PE includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&amp;T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (Projects 720 and 727). This PE addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers. By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the PE expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (Project 729). Project 730 provides funding for assessments in attitudes and opinions, longitudinal trends in Soldier and leader perceptions, and emerging issues to provide senior Army leaders with information on Soldiers' perceptions to inform personnel policy and program decision-making concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues. Project 731 provides funding for support for Army high performance computing centers. Project 733 provides funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process, while Project C16 supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems. Finally, this PE funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (Project C18). Coordination of this PE with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Ft. Belvoir, VA, the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft.

                                <r2:Description>Army SBIR and Army STTR programs. In 1982, Congress, through the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) established the SBIR program to foster the involvement of US based small businesses in federal research and development (R&amp;D). The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small, high-technology firms in the federal R&amp;D endeavor and give driven businesses the opportunity to provide innovative R&amp;D solutions in response to critical Army needs. The STTR program expands the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small business and the nation's premier nonprofit research institutions. The most important role of the STTR program is to foster the innovation necessary to meet the nation's scientific and technological challenges in the 21st century. The SBIR/STTR support services include program and technical advisory support services on a broad level. The Army SBIR/STTR Program Management Office mission requires synergized, integrated business solutions that concentrates on small business technological advances, and eliminates redundancy in a codified and consistent method that reduces confusion and ambiguity for the thousands of small businesses that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides support for the Field Assistance in Science and Technology (FAST) program. The FAST program provides Science Advisors, recruited from Army Materiel Command (AMC) headquarters and all AMC Major Subordinate Commands (MSC) to serve combatant commands and major commands worldwide.  FAST tours of duty provide significant professional growth opportunities for the Army's scientists and engineers and enable them to focus AMC resources on rapidly identifying and solving field technical problems that enable the improvement of readiness, safety, training, and reduce operations and support (O&amp;S) costs. The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers. The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&amp;S savings. FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers an Annual Program Review to facilitate sharing of lessons learned between science advisors at combatant commands, assists Combatant Commanders (COCOMS) with their annual Science and Technology Conferences. FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office). FAST supports warfighters in contingency operations with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports continuing technology investigations. It provides a coordinated tri-Service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  

Project 297 - Munitions Survivability &amp; Logistics: This Project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply. Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements. Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness. Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated. The early stages of force deployment are especially critical. Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets. These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater. Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life. This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.

Project 857 - DoD Explosives Safety Standards: This Project supports the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation efforts of the Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Safety Standards Board. It supports explosive safety effects research and testing to quantify hazards and to develop techniques to mitigate those hazards in all DoD manufacturing, testing, transportation, maintenance, storage, disposal of ammunition and explosives operations, and also to develop risk based explosives safety standards. Results are essential to the development and improvement of quantity-distance standards, hazard classification procedures, cost effective explosion-resistant facility design procedures, and personnel hazard/protection criteria.

Project 858 - Army Explosives Safety Management Program: This Project establishes, validates or modifies explosives technical safety requirements per Department of Defense Manual 6055.09 and Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-64, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. Project activities promote Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) of new and innovative explosives safety technologies that improve the survivability of Army personnel, facilities, and equipment as well as improve the health, safety and welfare of the general public (with highest priority directed to combat theater of operations).

Project 859 - Life Cycle Pilot Process: This Project supports the implementation of the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan through technology investigations, model based process controls, pilot prototyping, and industrial assessments. It will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements, and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products. Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP). LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation. In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs) / No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB). LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.

Project F21: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program funding assures interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC). In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production United States (U.S.) weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU). Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale. Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funding supports NATO small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation, and test operations. FY 2019 funding also supports JBMOU ballistic testing including firing tables, safety, reliability, and performance.

F24 - Conventional Munitions Demilitarization (Demil): The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization technology Project supports the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) responsibility per Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5160.68 to plan, program, budget and fund a Joint Service Research and Development (R&amp;D) program that develops capability and capacity as well as technology and facilities to support the SMCA mission to demil and dispose of conventional ammunition stored in the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A). The program goals include SMCA efforts to increase efficiencies and effectiveness to reduce the demil stockpile; reduce processing costs including packaging, handling and crating; and increase capacity through improved demilitarization capabilities and processes. Project F24 includes activities: (1) to establish requirements and develop processes to focus investments, assess capabilities, analyze alternatives, and recommend and implement R&amp;D projects; (2) to improve products and processes that support existing capabilities; (3) to develop or improve demil methods and processes related to advance the primary demilitarization core thrust areas of destruction, disassembly, removal, resource recovery and recycling, and waste stream treatment; (4) to ensure safe and environmentally acceptable demil operations; (5) to transition R&amp;D products to United States Army depots or plants as well as commercial facilities performing demil; and (6) to mitigate risk and close-out project activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Laboratory quantity testing: Explosives safety criteria are generally geared towards larger quantities of explosives where the specifics of the donor structure have less of an effect on the hazards generated. This is particularly problematic for lab quantities of explosives (e.g., 500 grams and lower), where the specifics of the construction type, room geometry, standoff, etc., can have a profound effect on the associated hazards. Current criteria is admittedly conservative in this regime, but testing and analysis are needed to justify reduced safety standoff distances. This work will leverage previous ATF lab quantities testing by increasing the explosive weight until breach of a sheetrock wall; determine the secondary breach debris hazards from a nominal laboratory room design; and assess overpressurization failure hazards of a nominal laboratory room design. This will result in reduced safety standoff distances for the conditions tested.  

Hazard Division 1.3 testing: As a result of a study of historical accidents approximately 75% of accidents are initiated by fire versus by detonation via an initiation chain. Also, the Insensitive Munitions Program has as a primary goal to develop more ?insensitive? munitions and their end state is systems that react by burn only. These two conditions combine to make the potential for a non-detonation reaction more likely in the event of an explosives accident.  This testing effort is designed to address the gaps in knowledge of HD 1.3/thermal hazards from a non-detonation reaction by performing testing to characterize the debris hazards from breakup of a confining structure, characterize the directional jetting effects from such structures, and assess the thermal hazard of burning in the open.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The DDESB is charged with developing DoD explosives safety standards. These standards are captured in several DoD issuances, but the primary one is DoDM 6055.09, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards.  Changes to DoDM 6055.09 must be approved by the DoD Explosives Safety Board. The Board Members have identified their priorities for update of DoDM 6055.09, and these priorities are reflected in the formation of DDESB working groups and test programs to develop new and revised explosives safety standards. This effort continually improves safety policy and guidance.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the implementation of the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan through technology investigations, model based process controls, pilot prototyping, and industrial assessments. It will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements, and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products.  Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP). LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation. In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB). LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC). In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition, and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy, and general product improvements. This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale. Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funding supports NATO small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation and test operations. FY 2019 funding also supports JBMOU ballistic testing including firing tables, safety, reliability, and performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) resources environmental quality technology (EQT)-related management support functions including support of research, development, test and evaluation required for EQT technical integration efforts at demonstration/validation test sites, technical information and activities, test facilities and general test instrumentation, and EQT requirement assessments. Funds required to support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects are included in this PE. In addition, support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address environmental quality requirements are included under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics Program.

The Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics Project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that both achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change in the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal. It includes systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life. It provides support to the system acquisition community, e.g., program and project managers, to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process. The goal is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs and includes efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities and to ensure the availability of Halon 1301 to support weapon system fire suppression requirements.  

The Pollution Prevention Tech Support Project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction, Airborne Lead Reduction, and Low Global Warming Potential (LGWP) environmental quality technology programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides RDTE Management Support for the demonstration and validation of weapon system pollution prevention technologies within the Army's Environmental Quality Technology program. The Project increases operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier and worker health risks and environmental impacts that would otherwise result in restoration needs and compliance enforcement actions against installations while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army. This Project provides for management of RDTE activities conducted under project 0603779A, Environmental Quality Technology Dem/Val (E21). The Project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by establishing toxicology assessments to support the demonstration of new materials and processes fulfilling the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides funding for the salaries and related personnel benefits for the authorized civilian personnel positions that provide for the management functions and the technical direction of the United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) mission located at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland. ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, and assessments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. 

This Program Element provides the non-Army Management Headquarters Activity (non-AMHA) management and administrative support that enables the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) to accomplish its research mission and includes personnel/manpower execution and oversight. ARI's behavioral and social science research provides effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints. ARI is the only Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory that conducts research to enhance the Soldier lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion). In addition, this Program Element includes staff/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range:  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) at APG, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WDTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC) at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) at Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of ~ 2,700 developmental tests; approximately ~60 operational events; and more than ~840 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs.

This PE does not finance test facility operations, test instrumentation or test equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project will conduct studies of sexual harassment and sexual assault response and prevention in support of National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requirements (FY12 S585; FY14 S1725c, FY14 S1733, FY16 S538) and the Chief of Staff of the Army's Readiness priorities related to caring for Soldiers and their families. Conducting studies to meet these requirements is a necessary step to ensure that training, prevention and outreach activities are having the desired effect and impact on the Total Force. Studies will focus on professionalizing the Sexual Harassment / Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) workforce (i.e., identifying the critical capabilities needed for positions of trust), building climates for dignity and respect, updating prevention and outreach materials and resources (e.g., training), developing effective and adaptive outreach resources, developing efforts to improve Department of Defense (DoD) prevention and response for male Service members, and assessing the efficacy of SHARP programs and tools.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, this Program Element (PE) realigns operational and mission support funding from PE 0605301A (Army Kwajalein Atoll) / Project DX2 (Army Kwajalein Test Ranges and Mission Support). Installation management functions for the Reagan Test Site remain in Project DX2.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space and Missile Defense Command-Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC-ARSTRAT) funding is for management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DoD) missile systems for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS). RTS began its funding under Program Element (PE)0605301A, Project DX2 in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. Beginning in FY 2018, operational and mission support functions at RTS were realigned to PE 0606002A. RTS is a tenant on the United States (U.S.) Army Garrison - Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), located within the Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (Space Situational Awareness; object tracking &amp; identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs.  Programs supported include Army Missile Defense, Air Force, and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational/demonstration/validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA ionospheric studies, space debris tracking, and data collection in support of space experiments. RTS is a government-managed/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M). Program funds contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts. Program funds contractors to accomplish O&amp;M for RTS instrumentation suites and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system. The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command/control/communications, safety, and data reduction systems. These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center. The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability. The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world, providing critical intelligence data. Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS. This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS. Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and Aegis Weapon System), and NASA's space experiments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds cyber vulnerabilities evaluations of major weapon systems in alignment with Section 1647 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016, and of critical infrastructure in alignment with Section 1650 of NDAA 2017. Efforts in this PE will: 1) identify, assess, and mitigate operational risk from cyber vulnerabilities as it pertains to critical Army weapon systems in an operational configuration; and 2) assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the information and control systems that underpin Army facilities and critical infrastructure by inventorying and assessing Facility-Related Control Systems (FRCS).

Weapon systems evaluations will assess and mitigate operational risk from a peer or near-peer adversary profile in accordance with existing testing requirements of the acquisition cycle. Where applicable, these evaluations will include tabletop exercises, lab assessments, and exercise/operational assessments of Program Executive Officer Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) and ground weapon systems. Cyber hardening efforts will apply knowledge from weapon systems vulnerability assessments to identify gaps and develop mitigation strategies to reduce operational risk and prioritize resources. Prioritization will be based on mission criticality, impact to readiness, and threat. This PE also provides for enhancement of existing Red Team elements and efforts attributed to Combatant Command mission-level cyber vulnerability assessments.

Evaluations of cyber vulnerabilities at critical infrastructure will focus on Task Critical Assets, Defense Critical Assets, and on units with high priority Quadrennial Defense Review missions and their supporting infrastructure. First, this PE provides for the training of teams to conduct cyber vulnerability evaluations on critical infrastructure. Once trained, these teams will conduct cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (Blue Teaming), adversarial assessments (Red Teaming), and assist with conducting assessments of cyber dependencies, vulnerabilities and threats in accordance with DoDI 8501.1 "Risk Management Framework." Funding will also provide for Contractor subject matter expertise to conduct Security Control Assessments and Deep Cyber Resiliency Assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports basic research at the Army laboratories through the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program.  Basic research lays the foundation for future developmental efforts by identifying fundamental principles governing various phenomena and appropriate pathways to exploit this knowledge.  The ILIR program serves as a catalyst for major technology breakthroughs by providing laboratory directors flexibility in implementing novel research ideas, by nurturing promising young scientists and engineers, and is used to attract and retain top doctoral degreed scientists and engineers.  The ILIR program also provides a source of competitive funds for peer reviewed efforts at Army laboratories to stimulate high quality, innovative research with significant opportunity for payoff to Army warfighting capability.  

This PE supports ILIR at the Army Materiel Command's (AMC) six Research, Development, and Engineering Centers (Project 91A), and at the U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) Technical Center (Project F16).

Work in the PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) builds fundamental scientific knowledge contributing to the sustainment of United States (U.S.) Army scientific and technological superiority in land warfighting capability and to solving military problems related to long-term national security needs, investigates new concepts and technologies for the Army's future force, and provides the means to exploit scientific breakthroughs and avoid technological surprises.  This PE fosters innovation in Army niche areas (e.g., lightweight armor, energetic materials, and night vision capability) and areas where there is no commercial investment due to limited markets (e.g., vaccines for tropical diseases).  It also focuses university single investigator research on areas of high interest to the Army (e.g., high-density compact power and novel sensor phenomenologies). The in-house portion of the program capitalizes on the Army's scientific talent and specialized facilities to transition knowledge and technology into appropriate developmental activities.  The extramural program leverages the research efforts of other government agencies, academia, and industry.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project fosters research for automatic target recognition (ATR) concepts to enhance the effectiveness of Army systems while simultaneously reducing the workload on the Soldier.  This Project focuses on the fundamental underpinnings of aided and unaided target detection and identification techniques for land warfare scenarios.  This research enables Army systems that can act independently of the human operator to detect and track targets including clandestine tracking of non-cooperative targets.  Such capabilities are needed for smart munitions, unattended ground sensors, and as replacements for existing systems.  Critical technology issues include low depression angle, relatively short range, and highly competing background clutter.  The resulting research will provide a fundamental capability to predict, explain, and characterize target and background signature content, and reduce the workload on the analyst.  This research is aimed at determining the complexity and variability of target and clutter signatures and ultimately utilizing that knowledge to conceptualize and design advanced ATR paradigms to enhance robustness and effectiveness of land warfare systems.  ATR research strategies include emerging sensor modalities such as spectral and multi-sensor imaging.  Research in this Project builds knowledge for several technology efforts including multi-domain smart sensors, third generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and advanced multi-function laser radar (LADAR). 

Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the United States (U.S.) Army Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC).

Work is this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology)/Project 906 (Tactical Electronic Warfare Applied Research).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports Army research in materials and devices for active and passive infrared (IR) imaging systems; radio frequency (RF) photonics for radar, communications, and electronic warfare applications; and laser technology for missile threat countermeasure protection.  This research aims to generate new technologies for unprecedented battlefield situational awareness and to continue the dominance of Army units during night operations.  To achieve these objectives, IR focal plane arrays (FPAs) and lasers with significantly improved performance, lower cost, and increased operating temperatures are required.  This research has direct application to Army ground vehicles, aviation platforms, weapon systems, and the individual Soldier.  Research is focused on material growth, detector and laser design, and processing for large-area, multicolor IR FPAs, ultraviolet (UV) avalanche photodiodes (APDs), and mid-wavelength IR and UV lasers.  The principal efforts are directed towards novel materials for detectors and lasers, and investigating energy band-gap structures in semiconductor materials to enhance the performance of lasers, IR FPAs and UV APDs.  In the area of RF Photonics, near-IR modeling and nanofabrication techniques are applied to the design and fabrication of IR photonic-crystal waveguide structures having customized IR properties.  This research also is intended to lay the foundation for the development of integrated optoelectronic circuits using active and passive devices and components such as lasers, waveguides, and detectors in conjunction with fiber optic interconnects for the generation, distribution, processing, and control of microwaves.  The fundamental physics of signal processing and noise generation as well as the conversion between the time and frequency domains and the optical and electrical domains in these optoelectronic circuits/systems will also be studied.  The technical goals are to: 1) manage and control defects in the raw, unprocessed materials, maintaining quality control in the fabrication of the devices and arrays, 2) limit introduction of impurities in the material, shielding device surfaces so that they are resistant to degradation over time and 3) thermal management, particularly as it applies to lasers.  This work is coordinated with the United States (U.S.) Army Communications Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  In the area of Advanced Materials, the research is to investigate the fundamental physics of energy, charge, and spin transport along and across active heterogeneous interfaces such as topological insulators, van der Waals heterostructures, solid/liquid interfaces, and bio/a-bio interfaces, and in new materials to achieve new electronic/optoelectronic device functionalities.

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinning to Program Element (PE) 0602709A (Night Vision Technology)/Project H95 (Night Vision and Electro-Optic Technology).

This fundamental knowledge forms the scientific "springboard" for the future development of applications, techniques, and tools to improve the tactical commander's knowledge of the operating environment. Results of this research are used to: extract and characterize natural and man-made features from reconnaissance imagery in near-real time; understand socio-cultural influences; exploit terrain analysis and reasoning techniques; and explore the potential of space, airborne, and terrestrial geospatial sensor technologies to provide real-time geospatial intelligence to all Army Warfighting functions. This research uses terrain and socio-cultural data to improve situational awareness and enhance information dominance, leading to increased survivability, lethality, and mobility.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project focuses on research to seek an in-depth understanding of the complex atmospheric boundary layer associated with high-resolution meteorology; the transport, dispersion, optical properties and characterization of chemical and biological aerosols; and the propagation of full-spectrum electro-magnetic and acoustic energy.  The future Army will operate in very complex environments (e.g., urban, mountainous, forested and jungle terrain) requiring new approaches to understand, characterize, and depict environmental phenomena and their effects on military systems, personnel and operations.  The lack of a complete understanding of the meteorological aspects of the complex microscale boundary layer in which the Army operates continues to impact our ability to provide predictable, actionable, accurate and timely tactical environmental intelligence to battlefield commanders and small Soldier units.  This Project focuses on producing the foundational environmental science research to characterize the atmospheric boundary layer and deliver novel capabilities and techniques including urban turbulence characterization for its effects on micro platforms and sensor payloads, high resolution urban wind flow modeling for more efficient and accurate prediction of the transport and dispersion of obscurants and chemicals, battlefield aerosol characterization and the interaction between aerosols and meteorological processes for Soldier health initiatives, characterization and detection of bio-warfare agent aerosols, environmental effects on acoustic and electromagnetic signal propagation in urban and other complex domains for improved target location and imaging, exploration of previously unexploited regions of the acoustic and electro-magnetic spectrum, and formulation of objective analysis tools that can assimilate on-scene all-source weather observations, atmospheric composition, and fuse this information with forecasts to provide immediate Nowcast products and actionable information.  These capabilities will have a direct impact on ensuring Soldier survivability, weapon system lethality, effective surveillance and reconnaissance, and the mobility required for future warfighter mission planning and execution operations.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project focuses on research that improves Soldier-system performance in future force environments by looking at  key phenomena underlying Soldier performance such as auditory spatial orientation (e.g., perception of azimuth, elevation and distance of sounds) within uncertain, degraded acoustic conditions; extending and protecting auditory and cognitive performance; human performance in automated, mixed-initiative (human control-machine control) environments; communications in hearing-degraded conditions; visual scanning and target detection; Soldier emotion and fatigue states; integration across multiple sensory modalities; perceptual-motor behavior; collaborative (team) and independent multi-task, multi-modal, multi-echelon Soldier-system performance - all cast against the influx of emerging transformation-driven technological solutions and opportunities. Technical barriers include lack of methods for describing, measuring, modeling, analyzing and managing the interplay of these phenomena due to the dynamic nature of human behavior and to the situational complexity and ambiguity that characterize operations in the future force. Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements and enable neuroengineering. These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier-system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on cognitive and perceptual processes. In the area of translational neuroscience, which is the transition of basic neuroscience research to relevant applications, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. In the area of cybernetics, which is a scientific discipline that bridges the fields of control theory and communication theory for the study and modeling of behavior in complex systems, research is carried out to examine the complex human-system-environment relationships that define, constrain, and influence the interactions between Soldier and system. Research efforts are pursued to advance theory, models, and methodological approaches that capture the dynamic and multidimensional nature of human behavior, including the temporal dependencies inherent to human behavior, through an integrated program of research efforts focused on: novel cybernetic models of human multisensory integration and human-system communication; neuro-inspired, bio-inspired, and engineering approaches to computational algorithms for multisensory integration and multi-sensor fusion to enable enhanced and augmented Soldier perception in human-system interactions; new methodological approaches for the design of multisensory displays and human-system communications; and multisensory test bed platforms for examining experimental hypotheses driven by model predictions and proof-of-principle applications of identified algorithms and methods.

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers)/Project H09 (Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance) and PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology)/H70 (Human Factors Engineering System Development).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project fosters research to increase the performance of small air-breathing engines and power-trains to support improved system mobility, reliability, and survivability for air and/or ground vehicles; and ultimately serves to reduce the logistics cost burden for the future force.  Problems addressed include the need for greater fuel efficiency and reduced weight in these propulsion systems.  Technical barriers to advanced propulsion systems are the inadequacy of existing materials to safely withstand higher temperature demands, the lack of capability to accurately simulate the flow physics and the mechanical behavior of these systems, including the engine and drive train.  The Army is the lead Service in these technology areas and performs basic research in propulsion, as applicable to rotorcraft as well as tracked and wheeled vehicles.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts basic research in materials science, which includes research into key phenomena enabling the creation and production of revolutionary materials that will provide higher performance, lighter weight, lower cost, improved reliability, and environmental compatibility for Army unique applications.  The current methodology of using materials to gain added functionality for Army systems is to use a layered approach, whereby each layer provides added capability (e.g., ballistic, chemical/biological, signature, etc.), but ultimately makes the system too heavy and too expensive.  Technical solutions are being pursued through understanding the fundamental aspects of chemistry and microstructure that influence the performance and failure mechanisms of ceramics, advanced polymer composites, and advanced metals, with the goal of creating hierarchically organized materials systems that possess multifunctional attributes at greatly reduced weight and cost.  These advanced materials will enable revolutionary lethality and survivability technologies for the future. 

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings for several Program Elements (PE) to include PE 0602105A (Materials Technology)/ Project H84 (Materials) and PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology)/H98 (Clothing &amp; Equipment Technology). 

Funding for this Project is increased due to the need to facilitate discovery and exploitation of biologically-enabled manufacturing of complex nanomaterials with substantial potential to improve material behaviors that could support Army capabilities.  The increase results from a realignment of funds from Project H7G under PE 0602105 (which is in Budget Authorization 2).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project seeks to improve the understanding of the chemistry and physics controlling the propulsion, launch, and flight of gun-launched projectiles and missiles, and to understand the interaction of these weapons with armored targets.  This research results in basic new knowledge, which allows the formulation of more energetic propellants, more accurate and non-lethal (NL)/lethal projectiles and missiles, and advanced armors for increased survivability of Army combat systems.  This effort supports the Office of the Secretary of Defense Advanced Energetics Initiative to mature the fundamental technologies required to transition the next generation of energetic materials into field use.  

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the theoretical underpinnings for Program Element (PE) 0602618A (Ballistics Technology)/Project H80 (Survivability and Lethality Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports basic research to produce future generations of sensors with capabilities beyond those currently being employed.  Technical barriers include the fundamental speed and bandwidth limitations of current materials and devices, the efficiency of current algorithms, current computing architectures, organic material lifetimes, the understanding of the fundamental concepts of quantum cryptography, and the spatial resolution of current radio frequency (RF) sensors.  The technical approach is to exploit large-scale electromagnetic (EM) models to predict and explain target and clutter scattering behavior, and research new digital and image processing modules and algorithms, beam propagation and material models of nonlinear optical effects, remote sensing and intelligent system distributive interactive simulations, and battlefield acoustic signal processing algorithms for improved, hazardous material detection and sensor data feature and information fusion under, unique sensor development, and survivable sensor systems.  This Project also funds research in the development of biologically inspired materials for use as sensors as well as for power generation and storage; and physics-based multi-scale models for electronic, optical, mechanical, and chemical materials.  Payoffs include high-data-rate military communications, improved radar signal processing techniques that will allow existing systems to improve spatial resolution, improved ultra-wideband radar technology for detection of explosives including mine detection, through-the-wall sensing and improved robotics perception, improved sensor approaches and signal processing techniques for enhanced acoustic/seismic sensing systems in noisy environments, distributed sensor data fusion in ad hoc networks, improved cryptography techniques, improved understanding of the physics and atomic properties of materials, and improved capabilities in hazardous material and event sensing.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports basic research to enable intelligent and survivable command and control, communication, computing, and intelligence (C4I) systems for the future force.  As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance.  This research supports the Army's Network Science initiative and addresses the areas of information assurance, signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, document and speech machine translation, and intelligent systems for C4I.  Major barriers to achieving the goals are the inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at lower echelons, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, new low-density languages, and information warfare threats.  These C4I technologies must accommodate heterogeneous security infrastructures and information exchange/security mechanisms between multiple levels of security.  The intelligent systems for C4I research focuses on providing the agent technology capabilities that will produce highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and Soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology) / Project Y10 (Computer/Information Science Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds basic research for improved tools and methods to advance structural health monitoring capabilities and enable condition-based maintenance for sustainment of rotorcraft and ground vehicles.  This research also enables the design and use of composite structures that can better address the cost, weight, performance, and dynamic interaction requirements of future platforms identified by the Army Modernization Strategy.  Ultimately, these technologies result in safer, more affordable vehicles with a greatly reduced logistics footprint.  This Project is a collaborative Army and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) effort that includes structures technology research into: structural integrity analyses; failure criteria; inspection methods which address fundamental technology deficiencies in both metallic and composite Army rotorcraft structures; use of composite materials in the design and control of structures through structural tailoring techniques; rotorcraft aeroelastic modeling and simulation; helicopter vibration (rotating and fixed systems); and the design and analyses of composite structures with crashworthiness as a goal.  The problems in structural modeling are inaccurate structural analysis and validation methods to predict durability and damage tolerance of composite and metallic rotorcraft structures and inadequate structural dynamics modeling methods for both the rotating and fixed system components to address reliability issues for future aircraft.  The technical barriers include a lack of understanding of failure mechanisms, damage progression, residual strength, high-cycle fatigue, the transfer of aerodynamic loads on the rotor to the fixed system, and impact of these unknown loads on aircraft components.  Technical solutions are focused on: advanced fatigue methodologies for metallic structures, improved composites technology throughout the vehicle, long-term investigation of integrated stress-strength-inspection, advanced methods for rotor system vehicle vibratory loads prediction, improved methods to predict vehicle stability, and improved analyses to address Army Aviation requirements.  These advancements will extend service life, reduce maintenance costs, enhance durability, and reduce the logistics footprint of existing and future Army vehicles.  This is the only basic research project supporting investigations for rotorcraft and ground vehicle structures within the Department of Defense.

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602211A (Aviation Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project focuses basic research on innovative technologies for industrial pollution prevention (P2) that directly supports the Army production base and weapon systems and also addresses non-stockpile chemical warfare (CW) site remediation.  Work in pollution prevention invests in next generation manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal methods that will result in significantly reducing the usage of hazardous and toxic substances and their associated costs.  The goal is to decrease the overall life-cycle costs of Army systems by 15-30% through the application of advanced pollution prevention technologies.  Non-stockpile CW efforts include establishing the ecotoxicity of CW compounds, environmental fate and effect of CW compounds in soils and biodegradation of CW compounds.  Pollution prevention thrusts include: environmentally acceptable, advanced, non-toxic processes to manufacture lightweight alternative structural materials to enhance weapon system survivability; clean synthesis of more powerful and improved energetic compounds to eliminate the use of hazardous materials and minimize the generation of wastes; and surface protection alternatives to hazardous paints, cadmium, chromium, and chromate conversion metal and composite surfaces.  

Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with the Army Environmental Requirements Technology Assessment (AERTA) requirements and contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project fosters basic research leading to medical countermeasures for naturally occurring diseases impacting military operations. Basic research for this project provides an understanding of the mechanisms that make organisms infectious and mechanisms that render the human body's response effective, preventing diseases caused by infectious agents. Understanding the biological characteristics of infectious organisms also enables the development of point-of-care and laboratory-based diagnostic tools (used to identify the nature and cause of a particular disease). Understanding of disease transmission by insects and other organisms helps in developing new interventions to prevent transmission of such diseases. Infectious disease threats from malaria, diarrhea, and dengue (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), common where Warfighters are stationed across all Unified Combatant Commands, are the highest priorities for basic research.

Research conducted in this project focuses on military-relevant infectious diseases in the following four areas:

(1)	Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Disease Threats
(2)	Bacterial Disease Threats
(3)	Viral Disease Threats
(4)	Vector Identification and Control

Work is managed by the Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.

Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602787A (Medical Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Malaria, which can cause fatal and chronic disease, is the most significant military infectious disease threat. This effort seeks to better understand the biology of malaria and leishmaniasis (a skin-based disease transmitted by sand flies predominantly exhibited as skin sores) parasites and to gain the necessary foundation for discovering medical countermeasures to protect military personnel from infection. Because the malaria parasite becomes resistant to drugs over time, it is necessary to continually search for parasite weaknesses that can be exploited by different drugs and vaccines. This effort seeks to better understand small molecule therapeutics and prophylactics, to overcome drug resistant organisms and identify new proteins in the design of candidate vaccines for various types of malaria including the severe form (caused by Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (caused by Plasmodium vivax). In FY17 the Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic Diseases research area and the Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria research area were merged into one task area titled Parasitic Diseases ? Drugs and Vaccines.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports basic research to understand the fundamental mechanisms of severe trauma to advance treatment and surgical procedures to save lives and improve medical outcomes for the Warfighter. Experimental models are being developed to support in-depth trauma research studies. This project includes studies of predictive indicators and decision aids for life-support systems; studies to heal and repair burned or traumatically injured hard and soft tissues of the eye, face, mouth, and extremities; studies to control severe bleeding; and studies on traumatic brain injury (TBI). Such efforts will minimize lost duty time and provide military medical capabilities for far- forward medical/surgical care of injuries. 
Research conducted in this project focuses on combat casualty care in the following four areas:

(1)	Damage Control Resuscitation
(2)	Combat Trauma Therapies
(3)	Combat Critical Care Engineering
(4)	TBI

Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602787A (Medical Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology, priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project fosters basic research on physiological and psychological factors that limit Warfighter effectiveness and on characterization of health hazards generated by military systems that result as a consequence of military operations; includes research on the neurobehavioral aspects of post-traumatic stress; develops concepts for medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the effects of muscle and bone injury to include reducing the effects of sleep loss and other stressors on Warfighter performance. The hazards of exposure to directed energy, repetitive use, fatigue, heat, cold, and altitude are also investigated under this Project.  

Research conducted in this Project focuses on military operational medicine in the following four areas:

(1) Injury Prevention and Reduction
(2) Physiological Health
(3) Environmental Health and Protection
(4) Psychological Health and Resilience
 
Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602787A (Medical Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports basic research to increase knowledge in the areas of terrain state and signature physics. It investigates the knowledge base for understanding and assessing environmental impacts critical to battlespace awareness. Projects include fundamental material characterization, investigation of physical and chemical processes, and examination of energy and mass transfer applicable to predicting state of the terrain, which control the effects of the environment on targets and target background signatures and mobility, in support of the materiel development community. The terrain state area of terrestrial sciences investigates weather-driven terrain material changes and the sensing and inferring of subsurface properties. The signature physics area of terrestrial sciences focuses on understanding the dynamic changes to electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic signatures, and energy propagation in response to changing terrain state and near surface atmosphere.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports basic research to investigate fundamental scientific principles and phenomena necessary to ensure efficient development of the technologies needed to address Army sustainment issues in the restoration, compliance, conservation, and non-industrial pollution prevention areas.  These efforts include: investigating and monitoring contaminated sites, including chemical contamination and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection and discrimination; better characterization of contaminants through improved risk-based assessment; destruction, containment, or neutralization of organics resulting from military activities in water, soil, and sediments; adhering to applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations; monitoring and controlling noise generation and transport; protecting and enhancing natural and cultural resources; reducing pollution associated with military activities; and the study of ecosystem genomics and proteomics in support of the Army's Network Science initiative.  

Work in this Project provides a fundamental basis for applied research in Program Element (PE) 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology)/Project 048 (Industrial Operations Pollution Control Technology), Project 835 (Military Medical Environmental Criteria) and Project 896 (Base Facilities Environmental Quality).

It enables future systems to support and unburden Soldiers by integrating technologies with an understanding of cognitive and physical needs, and the missions of the humans and (non-human) agents operating on the battlefield.  The ability of the Warfighter to command a suite of small unmanned systems (e.g., air, ground, and hybrid vehicles) reduces exposure of the Soldier to harm and improves the efficiency by which a dismounted unit achieves tactical objectives such as securing a targeted zone.  Example missions requiring enhanced autonomy, manipulation, and man-portability include rapid room clearing and interior structure mapping; detection of human presence, chemical/biological/nuclear/radiological/explosive (CBNRE), and booby-traps; surveillance; and subterranean passage detection and exploration.  Because of their relatively small size, light weight, and service in dismounted environments, small unmanned systems have unique challenges in perception, autonomous processing, mobility mechanics, propulsive power, and multi-functional packaging that transcend similar challenges associated with large unmanned systems.  The Army Research Laboratory (ARL)  conducts research in related disciplines, including machine perception, intelligent control, biomimetic robotics, manipulator mechanics, and propulsive power and drives to foster the development of technologies for lightweight, small-volume, robotics applications for harsh environments.  Machine perception research includes the exploration of lightweight ultra-compact sensor phenomenology and the maturation of basic machine vision algorithms that enable small unmanned systems to more fully understand their local environment.  Intelligent control research includes the maturation of autonomous processing capabilities and the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques that lead to reliable autonomous behavior in a large-displacement, highly-dynamic environment and permit unmonitored task performance.  Research in biomimetic robotics and manipulator mechanics includes the advancement of mechatronic and biomimetic appendages to enable agile high-speed locomotion, dexterous task-performance, and environmental-manipulation; and the maturing of nonlinear control algorithms to support robust, stable mobility. Propulsion power research includes investigations of engine cycles and alternative hybrid energy conversion techniques to provide compact, lightweight, quiet, low-emission, high-density power sources that support highly-portable unmanned systems capable of performing long-endurance missions.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project fosters basic research to establish and maintain a core capability to enable a molecular level understanding of properties and behaviors of materials relevant to the Army; by developing understanding and ability to manipulate nanostructured materials as a means to tune properties which meet desired performance requirements; by advancing the scientific understanding of surface properties and interfacial dynamics of complex materials; and by providing scalable processes grounded in a molecular understanding of materials.  This Project funds basic research in the characterization of chemical and biochemical phenomena occurring at or near solid surfaces and interfaces; the interactions between chemical reactions and transport processes on surfaces; theory and modeling of processes at complex surfaces; and the synthesis and characterization of catalysts that function at the nanoscale.  Investment in basic research centered on the surface science disciplines will enable growth of a knowledge base that will result in improved understanding of the interactions of complex materials in real world environments.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI), the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP), the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) program, and the Army's efforts in the Minerva Research Initiative (MRI). The MURI program funds university based basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining land combat technology superiority.  Army MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high-priority, transformational topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline (e.g., Intelligent Luminescence for Communication, Display, and Identification).  For many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application.  The DURIP provides funds to acquire major research equipment to augment current, or devise new, research capabilities in support of Army transformational research.  The PECASE program funds single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.  The MRI is a university-based social science research program.

Work in this PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the Minerva Research Initiative (MRI), a university-based social science research program initiated by the Secretary of Defense in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009.  It focuses on areas in the social sciences that are of strategic importance to national security policy which have not been substantially pursued in the past.  The Minerva research effort will be performed to understand the internal military-political dynamics of repressive regimes, the vulnerabilities of regimes and institutions to various kinds of disruption and instability, the nature of crowd dynamics, group violence, community belief structures, the potential to influence public opinion and attitudes in diverse cultures, cultural effects on network security and military operations, the influence of technology on military capabilities of potential adversaries and allies, and other intersections of social-cultural issues with military activities and national security.  Predictive models and other analysis tools will be developed.  Leveraging the expertise in the social sciences within the academic community is needed to provide understanding of the roots of terrorist organizations and the challenges and opportunities for military operations in a culturally diverse environment.  Better understanding at a fundamental level and new computational tools will provide a beneficial impact on war fighting capabilities at the national policy, military strategy, operational, and tactical levels, and will enhance the capabilities of intelligence activities at all levels.  All research results are open source.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) fosters university and industry based research to provide a scientific foundation for enabling technologies for future force capabilities.  Broadly, the work in this PE falls into three categories: Collaborative Technology Alliances / Collaborative Research Alliances (CTAs/CRAs), University Centers of Excellence (COE), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).  The Army formed CTAs to leverage large investments by the commercial sector in basic research areas that are of great interest to the Army.  CTAs are industry-led partnerships between industry, academia, and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to incorporate the practicality of industry, the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge from universities, and Army scientists to shape, mature, and transition technology relevant to the Army mission.  CTAs have been competitively established in the areas of Micro Autonomous Systems Technology (MAST), Network Sciences, Robotics, and Cognition and Neuroergonomics. CRAs are academia-led partnerships, which leverage the cutting-edge innovation found in the academic environment.  CRAs have been established in the areas of Multi-Scale Materials Modeling (electronic materials and materials in extreme environments) and in cyber security.  The COEs focus on expanding the frontiers of knowledge in research areas where the Army has enduring needs, and couples state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to increase the supply of scientists and engineers in automotive and rotary wing technology.  Also included are Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) and activities to stimulate interest in science, math, and technology among middle and high school students.  This PE includes support for basic research at three Army UARCs, which have been created to exploit opportunities to advance new capabilities through a sustained long-term multidisciplinary effort.  The Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies focuses on Soldier protection by emphasizing revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies focuses on enabling network centric-technologies, and broadening the Army's use of biotechnology for the development of bio-inspired materials, sensors, and information processing.  The Institute for Creative Technologies is a partnership with academia and the entertainment and gaming industries to leverage innovative research and concepts for training and simulation.  Examples of specific research of mutual interest to the entertainment industry and the Army are technologies for realistic immersion in synthetic environments, networked simulation, standards for interoperability, and tools for creating simulated environments.  This PE also includes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institution (HBCU/MI) Centers of Excellence that address critical research areas for Army Transformation.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project fosters research performed through the Cyber Security Collaborative Research Alliance (CSEC CRA), a competitively selected consortium, formed to advance the theoretical foundations of cyber science in the context of Army networks.  This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.  This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network.  The three aspects of cyber that are addressed are: 1) vulnerabilities and risks of cyber networks to malicious activities, 2) anticipating, detecting, and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities.  Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security.  The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms.

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology)/Project H92 (Communications Technology).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project fosters research through the Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), a competitively selected industry and university consortium, to leverage world-class research in support of future force and Army transformation needs.  Escalating levels of complexity and uncertainty on the current and future battlefield present conditions which have never existed before now.  Solution strategies and approaches must be developed or tailored.  The emerging field of neuroergonomics, which seeks to understand the brain at work and to leverage that understanding to optimize system design, offers tremendous potential for providing the solutions needed to meet the needs of Army forces in the future.  This CTA addresses the solution strategies and approaches needed to design systems to fully exploit investments in revolutionary technological advances in areas such as robotics, microelectronics, and computer and network information systems.  These technologies present significant opportunities to enhance Army mission capabilities, but impose significant burdens on the human brain, which will ultimately limit Soldier-system effectiveness, sustainability, and survivability.  The technical barriers associated with this project include: immature knowledge base to guide the neuroergonomic approach to human-system integration; inadequate capabilities to sense and extract information about brain activity in dynamic, operational environments; lack of valid measures to robustly and uniquely characterize operationally-relevant cognitive performance; lack of techniques for integrating advanced understandings of brain activity into systems designs, including real-time use of measures of cognitive behavior as system inputs and the capability to account for individual differences in maximizing Soldier-system performance.  This CTA conducts an intensive and accelerated program to formulate, validate, and transition basic research findings through multi-dimensional approaches focused in three areas: understanding fundamental principles underlying Soldier neurocognitive performance in operational environments, advancing computational approaches for the analysis and interpretation of neural functioning, and fundamental advancement in neurotechnologies that enhance Soldier-system interactions and performance.

The CRA links a broad range of government technology agencies, as well as industrial and academic partners with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). The DCIST CRA focuses on systems with a large number of heterogeneous intelligent agents, including Soldiers that can be distributed over large areas and are required to move through contested environments and against peer capabilities at op-tempo. To meet these goals innovative research is performed in three main technical areas: distributed intelligence, large heterogeneous group control, and adaptive and resilient behaviors. The payoff to the warfighter will be extended reach, situational awareness, and operational effectiveness against dynamic threats in contested environments, and technical and operational superiority through intelligent, resilient and collaborative behaviors of Soldiers and intelligent systems. The CRA facilitates the exchange of people among the collaborating organizations to provide cross-organizational perspectives on basic research challenges, and to make available to the Alliance state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project will foster research performed through the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA), a competitively selected consortium formed to advance the theoretical foundations of the Internet of Things in the context of Army Operations. The CRA will comprise academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of phenomena of Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems in tactically relevant environments. The CRA will facilitate collaboration across organizations to provide multi-disciplinary perspectives on basic research challenges, as well as the use of state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations. This research focuses on three interrelated aspects of pervasive and converged cyber- physical complex information systems and is conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the information-theoretic and human elements of Army IoBT interactions. The three aspects of the emergent Internet of Battlefield Things topical areas addressed are: 1) dynamic discovery and adaptation of cyber- physical devices, networks, and information sources, 2) resilient re-purposing and re-tasking of devices and information capabilities, and 3) algorithmic, distributed and centralized information-stream processing. Overarching goals of the basic research on Army IoBT are to investigate foundational cross-cutting theories and methods leading towards a science of heterogeneous, self-adapting, complex cyber-physical systems. This research will lead to optimized real-time adversarial situation estimates in information-enabled warfare and greatly enhance the speed and precision for complex military operations involving converged sensing, communications, and resilient actuation.

Work in this Project builds fundamental knowledge for and accelerates the transition of communications and networks technology to Program Element (PE) 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology).

This project conducts basic research in areas that will expand the capabilities of intelligent mobile robotic systems for military applications with a focus on enhanced, innate intelligence, ultimately approaching that of a dog or other intelligent animal, to permit unmanned systems to function as productive members of a military team.  Research is conducted in machine perception, including the exploration of sensor phenomenology, and the investigation of basic machine vision algorithms enabling future unmanned systems to better understand their local environment for enhanced mobility and tactical performance; intelligent control, including the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques for robot behaviors permitting future systems to autonomously adapt, and alter their behavior to dynamic tactical situations; understanding the interaction of humans with machines focusing upon intuitive control by Soldiers to minimize cognitive burden; dexterous manipulation of the environment by unmanned systems; and unique modes of mobility to enable unmanned systems to seamlessly navigate complex or highly constrained three dimensional environments.  The program will conduct both analytic and validation studies.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports a competitively selected university and industry consortium, the Network Sciences Collaborative Technology Alliance (NS CTA), formed to leverage commercial research investments to provide solutions to Army's requirements for robust, survivable, and highly mobile wireless communications networks, while meeting the Army's needs for a state-of-the-art wireless mobile communications networks for command-on-the-move.  The NS CTA performs foundational, cross-cutting network science research leading to: a fundamental understanding of the interplay and common underlying science among social/cognitive, information, and communications networks; determination of how processes and parameters in one network affect and are affected by those in other networks; and prediction and control of the individual and composite behavior of these complex interacting networks.  This research will lead to optimized human performance in network-enabled warfare and greatly enhanced speed and precision for complex military operations.  The CTA facilitates the exchange of people among the collaborating organizations to provide cross-organizational perspectives on basic research challenges, as well as the use of state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations. Many of the results of the NS CTA provide a foundation for a new Collaborative Research Alliance for the Internet of Battlefield Things to begin in FY18.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the International Technology Centers (ITCs) and the Foreign Technology (and Science) Assessment Support (FTAS) program.  

The nine ITCs located in in North America, South America, Asia, and Europe support the Army's goals of providing the best technology in the world to our Warfighters by leveraging the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments of our international partners.  The ITCs perform identification and evaluation of international technology programs to assess their potential impact on the Army's S&amp;T investment strategy.  ITC 'technology finds' are submitted as technology information papers (TIPs) to various Army S&amp;T organizations for evaluation and consideration for further research and development.  Highly promising research will be awarded seed funding by the ITC through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.  The FTAS program also builds upon the TIPs submitted by the ITCs.  In some cases the TIP is truly unique and may well meet an Army requirement or potentially support ongoing Army S&amp;T investments.  In such cases, the FTAS program can provide initial resources (seed money) to determine the appropriateness of these technology areas identified by the TIPs as having potential relevance to the Army.  These efforts will provide information useful in making early assessments of the technology's potential contributions to the Army's S&amp;T strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports simulation and training technology research at the Army's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) at the University of Southern California.  The ICT was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support Army training and readiness through research into simulation, mixed and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and learning sciences. ICT applies the results of this research and proves its value in Army relevant applications such as training, mission rehearsal, leadership development, cultural awareness, negotiation, health and medical, and distance learning.  The ICT actively performs research and engages industry and academic institutions internationally to incorporate the latest research results and hardware and software into its research program and application development and exploit dual-use technology. The ICT serves as a means for the military to learn about, benefit from, and facilitate the transfer of applicable technologies into military systems.  In addition the ICT works with creative talent from the entertainment industry to advance and leverage techniques and capabilities and adapt concepts of story and character to increase the degree of participant immersion in synthetic environments in order to improve the realism and usefulness of these experiences.  In developing a true synthesis of the creativity, research, technology, and capability of industry and the research and development community, the ICT is revolutionizing capabilities for the Army by making it more effective in terms of cost, time, range of experiences and the quality of the result and by producing research and applications that will benefit the Army of the 21st century. Resulting research, techniques, and technologies are transitioned for maturation to Program Element (PE) 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation) / Project D02 (Modeling &amp; Simulation for Training and Design).

The future uniform will integrate a wide range of functionality, including ballistic protection, responsive passive cooling and insulating, screening of chemical and biological agents, biomedical monitoring, performance enhancement, and extremities protection.  The objective is to lighten the Soldier's load through system integration and multifunctional devices while increasing survivability.  The new technologies will be compatible with other Soldier requirements, including Soldier performance, limited power generation, integrated sensors, communication and display technologies, weapons systems, and expected extremes of temperature, humidity, storage lifetimes, damage, and spoilage.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) activities that encourage elementary/middle/high school and undergraduate youths to develop an interest in and pursue education and employment in the STEM fields. These activities are coordinated within the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) that links and networks appropriate components to derive the best synergies to present the Army to a larger pool of technical talent and to provide students with Army-unique practical experiences at Army laboratories, centers, and institutes and expose them to DoD careers. AEOP increases interest and involvement of students and teachers across the nation in STEM at all proficiency levels and backgrounds to include under-represented and economically disadvantaged groups through exposure to Army sponsored research, education, competitions, internships, and practical experiences. This Project utilizes Army STEM assets to contribute to a STEM literate citizenry as well as enhances the national pool of science and engineering personnel that in turn supports defense industry and Army laboratory and research, development, and engineering center needs.

The Materials in Extreme Dynamic Environments consortium, led by Johns Hopkins University partnered with CalTech, Rutgers University, and University of Delaware, focuses on understanding materials under high strain rates.  The Multiscale Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials consortium, led by University of Utah partnered with Boston University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, focuses on microscale properties to design macroscale behavior for electronics.  Research at both CRAs will address the modeling and experimental challenges associated with developing multidisciplinary physics simulations across multiple length scales for materials to include: a limited ability to relate materials chemistry, structure, and defects to materials response and failure under extreme conditions; an inadequate ability to predict the roles of materials structure, processing, and properties on performance in relevant extreme environments and designs; and the lack of experimental capabilities to quantify multiscale response and failure of materials under extreme conditions.

Work in this Project supports key Army needs and is coordinated with work performed in Program Element (PE) 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences)/Project H44 (Adv Sensor Research) and H42 (Materials and Mechanics).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Research will focus on the following areas: two-way multiscale modeling for predicting performance and designing materials, investigating analytical and theoretical analyses to effectively define the interface physics across length scales; advancing experimental capabilities for verification and validation of multiscale physics; and modeling and strategies for the synthesis of high loading rate tolerant materials so that all of the latter lead to the development of a comprehensive set of metrics that define high loading rate tolerant material systems.  The multiscale modeling capability will be applied across multiple disciplines to facilitate revolutionary advances in materials for coupled environments (electromagnetic, high rate, high pressure and other extreme environments).</r2:Description>

The focus will be on establishing a first of its kind, multi-site distributed quantum network based on quantum memories.  The Center for Distributed Quantum Information will study and demonstrate both the physical backbone and network layer for a robust quantum information network that will provide secure and tamper-proof communications and exponentially greater information processing capabilities for the future Army.  The Center for Distributed Quantum Information will perform collaborative research with Army in-house scientists and engineers to help accelerate the transition of the research.  In addition to providing the required expertise and critical mass to the effort, the  consortium will also bring together a broad but unified multi-disciplinary research team needed to accelerate progress in the field of quantum information sciences.

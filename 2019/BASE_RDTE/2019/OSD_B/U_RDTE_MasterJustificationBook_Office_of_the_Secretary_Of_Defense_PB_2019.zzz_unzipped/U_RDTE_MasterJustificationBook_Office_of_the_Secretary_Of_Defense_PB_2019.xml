                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supporting basic research provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in areas of research important to U.S. military capabilities – including physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences, among others.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.

The Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (Vannevar Bush), formerly known as the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research Initiatives project code, P010, includes Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) and the Minerva Research Initiative.

SSBR supports oversight, policies, and initiatives to implement the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering's (USD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department.  SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve the science and engineering (S&amp;E) workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with the academic research community and international partners.

The Minerva Research Initiative, a department-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation’s only social science basic research programs in support of national security.  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Text>Hosted the inaugural Science, Technology, and Innovation Exchange (STIx) conference in August 2018.  This conference brought together DoD-funded researchers, including Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellows, National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellows, and Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Fellows, as well as university faculty researchers together with defense laboratory scientists and program managers from the Services and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  STIx showcased and connected the nation's brightest minds to communicate new ideas and share novel approaches to confronting old challenges facing the defense community.  Its Ted-like lightening talks were streamed online over two days and are posted on the web.

Planned and published a broad agency announcement for the Defense Enterprise Scientific Initiative (DESI) pilot program with assistance from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in August 2017.  DESI was funded through the FY 2017 plus-up.  The program aims to inspire the collaboration among universities and industries in fundamental research.

Executed the first competition for the I-Corps @ DoD Commercialization pilot program, and supported 6 teams established in FY 2016.  One team received follow-on private capital to commercialize their research and another received the most improved award from the National Science Foundation's I-Corps teaching team.  The second competition is currently underway and will fund up to 12 teams.

Selected ten laboratory scientists for the 2017 class of Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative (LUCI) Fellows.  The research topics included advanced manufacturing, robotics, data analytics, optics and novel engineering materials.  The awardees included NDSEG and SMART Fellowship recipients.  Organized the first review of the LUCI program in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory in September 2017.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) fosters and enhances the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ability to access high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP is executed by the STEM Development Office, under the Defense Laboratories Office within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  NDEP’s portfolio includes the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program, the Military Child Pilot Program (MCPP), STEM Education and Outreach, and the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP).  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation by enabling an increased capacity to address ever-changing future defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through programs and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges.

NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

The SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and hires the students, upon graduation, into DoD's workforce.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,400 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 1,350 have completed their academic pursuit and transitioned into DoD employment.  Approximately 1,100 have completed their service to the Department.  SMART ensures the Department has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission.

The MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, authorized the establishment of this Pilot Program.

STEM Education and Outreach fosters conditions for activities to support and cultivate STEM talent with minds for innovation, diversity of thought, and the technical agility to sustain the Department’s competitive edge.  In order to build a necessary workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Initiatives include investing, promoting, and participating in national-level STEM programs and efforts as well as providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the Nation.

The DoD is constantly looking for innovative scientific and technological solutions to address current and future military requirements.  The MEEP will enhance existing or establish new education programs that support manufacturing engineering.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 19 academic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines identified as areas of future workforce needed by DoD.  

The disciplines align with the Department’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas, and include:  Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the Department on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  Approximately 1,100 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 74 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.

Since FY 2005, approximately 2,400 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2016, approximately 1,350 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) program in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  The program is authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 2362 and is funded by annual appropriations.  This competitive program provides support through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts for research, education assistance, and instrumentation purchases.

Work in this PE provides a foundation to enhance participation of HBCUs/MIs in DoD research, including infrastructure; strengthen research and educational opportunities at HBCUs/MIs and increase the number of minority graduates in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines important to the national defense; and build a more diverse pool of scientists and engineers to meet future workforce needs.

Work in this PE is performed by the Services’ Research Offices and DoD Laboratories (includes the Army Research Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory) for Centers of Excellence (COE).  Centers currently funded through cooperative agreements include COEs in Autonomy, Cyber Security, and Research Data Analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools and large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer internship programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Instrumentation purchases.  The program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment, such as lasers and spectrometers, for enhancements to the basic research efforts.

•  Technical assistance.  The funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding by assisting the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The interns/fellows gave presentations about their research experiences at an August 2017 Basic Research Office-sponsored event.

Worked with Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Rome, New York to provide summer 2017 research opportunities for students from HBCUs/MIs operating the Centers of Excellence for Autonomy, Cyber Security, and Research Data Analysis.  The results of these students’ summer research experiences were presented at a poster session at AFRL in August 2017.

Coordinated with the Navy Cyber Security Information Assurance Program Partnership to provide four internship/co-op opportunities for HBCU/MI students in information assurance/cyber security.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technology Program (JIMTP) aims to develop the enabling technologies needed to build weapons in compliance with statutory requirements (United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389) and regulation (DoDI 5000.1 and 5000.02, and CJCSI 3170.01F).  This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned to the Program Executive Officers (PEOs), thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges.  This is especially true with increased performance requirements for improved and new systems. 

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>HPP focuses on the development of technologies to improve the IM response of HPP systems, rocket motors with Ammonium Perchlorate and with or without a metal fuel, for rockets and missiles launched from air, ground, and sea platforms.  These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization, and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large HPP motors.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>AAW focuses on the development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies for improving IM of AAW munitions.  The development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies, when applied to munitions, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintain munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, new ingredient synthesis and characterization, initial formulation development, scale-up, warhead/charge configuration, venting techniques for both munitions and their containers, protection/packaging materials and systems, shock mitigation liners, and initiation devices, techniques, and technologies.  Applications vary but include high performance warhead fills, booster explosives, and all other technology to mitigate the violent response of AAW munitions to IM threats.  Munition operating conditions may be controlled or have widely varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and vibration, and other factors such as cost, availability, and reliability may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the AAW MATGs are concentrated on solving the IM response of anti-armor warheads to the Fragment Impact and Slow Cook-off, threats for larger and Medium Caliber Munitions.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This RDT&amp;E effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, "DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians," and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into Budget Activity (BA) 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature BA 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.

The Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) investments are focused on capability areas that have been validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  The four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three technology areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the fuze environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The LL Program supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds ten technology project areas.  

Of these, there are five core-technology areas:
• Advanced Devices
• Optical Systems and Technology
• Information, Computation and Exploitation
• Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology
• Cyber Security, Science and Engineering

There are four emerging-technology initiatives:
• Advanced Materials and Processes
• Quantum System Sciences
• Biomedical Sciences and Technology
• Autonomous Systems

There is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. 

These ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence:
• The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&amp;T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today’s global S&amp;T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow’s future.  The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Investments in optical-based technologies can fill the critical technology gaps in emerging DoD threat areas, such as anti-access/area denial (A2/AD), counter–weapons of mass destruction (C-WMD), and asymmetric warfare. Optical systems and technologies will also improve capabilities using new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in traditional DoD mission areas such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), space control, communications, and ballistic missile defense.</r2:Description>

In FY 2017, five new projects have been initiated: (1) the Zero-Seam-Loss Large Format Tiled IR DFPA project, which  shows great promise to scale focal plane sizes for many different imaging detectors by orders of magnitude; (2) the Long-wave Infrared (LWIR) Coherent Laser Radar project, bringing to remote sensing methodologies orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity in tactically useful wavebands; (3) the Computational Reconfigurable Imaging Spectrometer project to extend the SEEIT methodology to hyperspectral imaging; (4) the On Orbit Sensor Test and UV Phenomenology for Space Situational Awareness Systems project, that is leveraging a Lincoln developed UV space sensor for an experiment on the International Space Station; and finally (5) an Integrated Planar-Lens Based Chip-Scale Lidar project that takes optical LADAR into the extremely small form factor, integrated photonics domain.</r2:Text>

Research in computing-intensive algorithms as well as more capable focal plane arrays will demonstrate higher resolution images. Until now, a laser radar on a large aircraft produced three-dimensional (3D) images only after hours of processing on the ground. Development of a small laser radar in FY 2018 will allow real-time 3D images on a small unmanned air vehicle. Microwave radars with multiple receivers have many advantages including multiple look angles, stealthy receivers, and higher resolution. Research with simultaneous microwave beams and optical beacons will explore techniques to overcome synchronization and coherent combining difficulties. The ability for wavelength agility will become as important in the optical domain as it is for microwave electronic warfare. So, development of multi-wavelength imaging spectrometers, long-wavelength infrared laser radars, and wavelength-agile short pulse lasers will provide continued capability growth while ensuring that deployed countermeasures in overused optical regions will not thwart DoD capabilities.</r2:Text>

Other efforts are targeted at developing and implementing novel model systems and sensors, medical support tools, and the application of big data analytics to areas such as medical image analysis. Novel model systems and sensors include: the Lincoln Laboratory Artificial Gut that is helping to decipher the complex relationship between the nervous system and the microbiome, which has been correlated with depression and stress, as well as neuro-generative diseases including Parkinson’s Disease; and development, design and prototyping of an engineered sensor platform capable of real-time monitoring of health biomarkers in the body or in body fluids. Novel medical support tools include: a novel hearing aid design that uses deep neural networks to reduce the cognitive burden of isolating a single speaker in background noise, which is of relevance for normal and hearing impaired warfighters; and implementation of artificial intelligence to develop a system for field forward casualty care that reduces the burden on medics providing combat casualty care.</r2:Text>

One effort is developing an integrate Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capability at the tactical edge, by using cloud computing and robust, hierarchical communications technology. This project is designing a Cloud architecture for PED, which would be available at forward-deployed bases.  Another project is an Autonomous and Reconfigurable Maritime Networking Demonstration. This project builds on a recent underwater communication demonstration from the Optical Systems and Technology area. In FY 2017, active pointing and tracking of the terminals technology is being for adaptive communications between moving undersea objects.  The third effort is focused on risk reduction research and architectural design for a 3D imaging laser radar system to be deployed on a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite. This ladar has the potential to observe structures under foliage with global coverage.</r2:Text>

The undersea laser communications project will refine the pointing-and-tracking technology needed to accomplish narrow beam communications, and will do in-water testing of a communication network between multiple moving platforms. The 3D space-based ladar effort will continue with risk reduction in key areas, including data-registration for forming 3D image and space optics technology. The project will accelerate the design of a future generation micro-air vehicle (MAV) for integrating advanced power, guidance, control, and payloads. Maturation of wafer-scale integration processes will lead to development of designs for applying these processes to small satellite systems.</r2:Text>

Research into novel approaches for computer hardware/software design will guide the design and development of a fundamentally new computing system that is inherently secure and can ensure mission success even when compromised. This effort will be complemented by developing a data-centric approach to ensuring self-protection of data throughout storage, computation and transit. Research into cyber resilient approaches for mission assurance includes the development and implementation of a secure processing engine for autonomous systems, and the development and validation of an automated capability for contested environments where a host may be disabled or compromised. Other cyber efforts include further developing the capability to automatically generate effective cyber courses of action for evolving threat environments such as damage by an attacker after network penetration, securing small satellites against the growing threat of cyber-attack, and securing the ability to compute on private data without revealing it and demonstrating this capability for a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) application.</r2:Text>

Preparing for Enhanced Energetic Materials: An affordable CL-20: The singular solution to range and energy challenges is to make both propellant formulations (for range) and explosive formulations (for energy) using the most powerful, mature energetic crystal, CL-20. Current use of CL-20 is extremely limited because of its cost of large-scale manufacture ($1,000/lb). The proposed work intends to achieve new, cheaper, high-yield, production routes to CL-20.
- Research CL-20 production with fewer organic synthesis reactions, thereby reducing production costs; these reactions will employ commercially available metal catalysts, instead of the current expensive Palladium catalyst required.
- Pursue the CL-20 precursor known as TetraAcetylDiAminohexaazaisowurtzitane (TADA), utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) starting materials.
- Work on small-scale mixing of CL-20 propellant formulations to achieve reasonable viscosity, pot life, mechanical and safety properties.

Development of Prototype Soft Epidermal Biosystems with Advanced Sensing Capabilities for Warfighters in Triage Settings: To develop a wireless epidermal system that integrates flexible electronics and a range of biosensors to provide rapid vital sign screening solution for battlefield triage of combat casualties. 
- Development of stretchable circuit and biosensor designs.
- Integration of soft elastomeric substrates and fluidic channel.
- Validation of porcine animal model and test conditions for future evaluation of novel epidermal biosystems.
- Evaluation of epidermal biosystems in porcine animal models and clinical settings.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>Additive manufacturing (AM) of energetics provides the ability for tailored and integrated munitions with enhanced capabilities.  Integration of unique printed structures and printed energetics with smart fusing can allow for more agile manufacturing processes with reduced development times.  As a cross-service area of interest, the Department of Defense (DoD) Communities of Interest in Materials and Manufacturing Processes and Weapons Technologies have engaged in discussions to identify areas of collaboration.  In order to rapidly advance additive manufacturing of energetics, a joint effort across the services and the Department of Energy would support the programs interested in AM of energetics, such as Program Executive Office for Ammunition, Next Generation Hand-Grenade, Harpoon, and Lightweight torpedo.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States military forces require resilient and reliable networks, information, and weapons systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cybersecurity of all Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure the Department's missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cybersecurity and computer network operations to:  develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new and resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to disrupt, fight and survive nation-state actors’ cyber-attacks, measure the state of health in cybersecurity, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, along with the ability to protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.

This program is unique in that it integrates both the defensive and offensive cyber research from each of the Services to develop interoperable, defense-wide technology options targeted to meet Combatant Command needs and requirements.  More specifically, by increasing cross-laboratory collaboration, this program is able to take Service-specific technologies and expand their applications to the Joint Force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Recently, S&amp;T gaps were enumerated and described in several studies, including the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2016 Commission Enhancing National Cybersecurity, and the 2017 Defense Science Board Research Enterprise Assessment.  The Cyber Applied Research program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  Over the past several years, the program expanded research in cyber capabilities to provide Warfighters and commanders with tools and technologies to enable cyber situational awareness, cyber command-and-control, cyber operations, and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  From FY 2011 to FY 2017, the program explored a number of technical thrusts that included:

• Foundations of Trust:  Developing known degrees of assurance that devices, networks, and cyber-dependent functions perform as expected, despite attack or error.  

• Resilient Infrastructure:  Exploring technologies that not only withstand, but react to cyber attacks, and sustain or recover critical functions. 

• Assuring Effective Missions:  Developing technologies that assess and control the cyber situation in mission context while staging, conducting, and monitoring cyber responses.

• Cyber Modeling, Simulation &amp; Experimentation:  Simulating environments in which the Department operates and enables a more robust assessment and validation of the cyber technology development. 

• Embedded, Mobile &amp; Tactical Environments:  Exploring cyber systems that rely on technologies beyond wired networking and standard computing platforms.

As adversaries develop more sophisticated technology tactics and become more skilled and better funded, the Cyber S&amp;T Community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  Starting in late FY 2016, the Department reviewed the emerging needs of the joint operational community, new cyber threats, and the evolution DoD technology needs to focus the program on the changing cyber environment and missions.  To bolster this program and address future threats, a new strategic vision was developed to enhance the DoD’s tactical edge in the rapidly evolving cyber domain where many aspects still remain unexplored.  Seedling projects under the new research areas were initiated in late FY 2017.  Judiciously investigating aspects of this research in thrusts areas identified below will provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts: 

• Behavioral Cyber Sciences:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond signals (ones and zeroes) towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral sciences will increase the effectiveness of tools, the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber sciences seeks to uncover details about how humans (to include operators, users, adversaries, and/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood from a behavioral science standpoint and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcome.  

• Self-securing weapons, systems, and networks:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to keep pace with the growing complexity of weapon systems and help the DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the recent advances in artificial intelligence research. 

• Foundations of precision cyber operations:  Precision bombing campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired effects of cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.

• Mathematical Foundations of Cyber Security:  Advancing mathematical foundations of cyber S&amp;T will cut across focus areas and produce new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.

Advances in these new cyber S&amp;T focus thrust areas will help to promote strong foundations and disruptive innovations that will create surprises, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas will be critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cyber security beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This technical area encompassed all aspects of the assessment, establishment, propagation, maintenance, and composition of trust relationships between devices, networks, and people.  Achieving a trustworthy cyberspace was a critical challenge as corporations, agencies, national infrastructure, and individuals have been victims of cyber-attacks, which exploit weaknesses in technical infrastructures as well as in human behavior.  This effort built upon long term foundational basic research in algorithms, models, probability theory, reliability, statistical theory and analysis, system structures, and secure computing, developing and enabling trustworthy cyber systems.

Research in algorithms helped develop methods to manipulate automated image processing computation using Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs), accelerating graphics processing unit (GPU) analysis.  The development and compilation of GPU tools into a library provided meta-learning capabilities that were used to improve trust in digital electronics.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Resilient Infrastructure entailed the ability to withstand cyber attacks and to sustain or recover critical functions.  This provided the ability to continue to perform functions and provided services at required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area was to develop integrated architectures that were optimized for their ability to absorb cyber shock and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state with well-defined performance characteristics.  Resilient algorithms and protocols increased the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research was needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resilient architectures.

Funded research under the Tactical Platform Cyber Resiliency project, developed techniques for furnishing resiliency on critical real-time control systems against cyber-attacks.  Through the enhancement of existing fault tolerance on physical systems, known as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), combinations of artificial, manipulated crashes, and delayed input evolved a level of tolerance to enforce resilience.  The successful collaboration with Siemens transitioned the technology to the Naval Capability Program, Resilient Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical Security (RHIMES), which is now supports the NATO Sea Sparrow program.

Under the Network PUMP-II project, research explored the challenges of optimizing enterprise based data sharing requirements for the tactical war-fighter and intelligence missions.  The project developed a cost effective, high throughput government-off-the-shelf cross domain solutions that provided the war-fighter with improved sensitive data correlation and intelligent data decision capabilities.  The technology is transitioning to the Naval Air Systems Command, Triton Unmanned Aircraft System Program Office.</r2:Description>

Additionally, ONR will experiment with and evaluate resilience techniques through its Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) performers.  Projects that were designed to quickly transition to operational partners will continue maturing capabilities, inhibiting advanced threats, improving technology maturity, and exploring transition opportunities.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>Assuring Effective Missions presented technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Within this thrust, research was developed to assess and control the cyber situation within a military mission context.  Cyber Mission Control covered the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal by developing tools and techniques that enabled models of cyber operational behaviors (cyber and kinetic) to determine the correct course of action in the cyber domain.  Effects at Scale encompassed full spectrum challenges that intersected with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.

Funded research under the Mission Assurance Research Collaboration (MARC), a U.S.-Australia cyber effort to enhance mission assurance through data enrichment, deep learning and natural language processing.  The research developed dynamic mission mapping capabilities that were later integrated into Talisman Sabre 2017 (TS17).  As a result, the MARC team successfully captured ~12 terabytes (TB) of operationally relevant, shareable data that it will use to analyze for future research.  This massive data set represents a huge asset to the future of this five-year collaboration.  Additionally, the team established relationships with I-CORPS and  Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) as the network providers for the exercise, laying the groundwork for capability demonstration, test, and evaluation in future exercises.</r2:Description>

Upon successful completion of testing, the existing cyber situational awareness tools will be integrated and implemented into the OCO architecture. 

MARC will aim to complete instrumentation during TALISMAN SABER 17 exercises.  Additional research objectives include proof-of-concept and testing of a machine finger-printing algorithm.  Final research papers on deep learning, natural language processing, entity extraction/characterization and workflow discovery will also be produced.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>Developed modeling and simulation capabilities that were able to sufficiently simulate the cyber environment in which the DoD operates and enables a more robust assessment and validation of cyber technology development.  There were two technical challenges associated with cyber MSE:  1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation, and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation sought to develop tools and techniques that enabled analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement developed cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area explored new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, applying the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research could be conducted, to test hypotheses with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies enabled the exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that drove innovation in research.  Additionally, these methodologies aided in integrating experimentation by simulating the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity and integrating cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.

Funded research under the Metrics, Instrumentation and Emulation for Cyberspace Operations, Electronic Warfare (EW) and Communications/Networking project developed a selected set of vignettes and scenarios to understand the complex interactions between red and blue networks.  The metrics derived from analyzing these scenarios were used to better inform future design choices in cyberspace, EW, and communications systems.  The dynamic scenarios developed under this research are being migrated into to a distributed test-bed to support development of analytical tools.</r2:Description>

The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems was to develop tools and techniques that assured the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons systems and platforms; enabled security in real-time systems; and established security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also sought to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating enterprise commodity mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it was of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices could be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked.

The Resilient and Assured Unmanned Aerial Systems Operations (RAUSO) project developed technologies to harden unmanned aerial systems (UAS) platforms and provided better cyber awareness to operators through the integration of a number of cyber tools and capabilities.  The approach leveraged a high-assurance hardware platform developed under the Assured Resilient Embedded Systems (ARES) program, to build a cyber security module software stack capable of monitoring sensor inputs and process behavior, while responding with security-relevant actions. The technology has been incorporated into the ARES platform and is being considered for a General Electric (GE) Aviation flight control system, with possible flight tests in FY 2018.</r2:Description>

Cyber operations should be seen in the context of a larger socio-behavioral-technical domain.  Research in behavioral cyber science seeks to advance the understanding and technical rigor of modeling and predicting human responses to cyber activities and to discover ways to inject this understanding into the human aspects of cyber operations, cyber defense systems, planning, and training.  Future research must broaden the scope beyond the impacts of cyber actions on equipment, and also include the impact that these cyber actions will have on broader human behavior.  Just as an adversary’s behavior may be better understood using behavioral cyber science, behavioral science can be utilized to help understand ways to improve the actions of cyber defenders and the performance of the cyber workforce.  Data gleaned from observing effects of various cyber operations on users’ productivity, performance, and security will help the cyber workforce design better techniques and processes for use in cyber defense.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The pervasive nature of software-reliant systems in today’s modern military creates new opportunities for sophisticated adversaries.  The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against cyber-attacks.  Defending the software- and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  The Department can expect future cyber adversaries to be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that can defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against the adversary.  The DoD needs systems that will autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems could identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, be able to neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems is crucial to ensure that direct control can be reasserted, potentially reversing actions, if necessary.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>When compared to traditional methods of kinetic warfare, cyber conflict is still relatively new and untested.  Cyber operators often have incomplete information about their target prior to completing an action.  The lack of a complete picture makes it difficult to predict the precise outcomes or collateral damage caused by a cyber operation. In this type of uncertain environment, military leaders may be acting with an undue sense of caution in using cyber capabilities.  Improved technology and techniques for quantifying cyber effects, estimating their cost and effectiveness, predicting consequences, and ensuring precise effects will help both to limit collateral damage and to ensure that a chosen action has the intended effect upon the adversary.  Highly precise and predictable cyber effects can also achieve mission goals despite the presence of both incomplete and maliciously-created false information.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Warfighting in the cyber domain often operates at sub-second timescales and across multiple domains of authority.  Methods used to accomplish many tasks (e.g., malware analysis, coordinating multiple agents) demand large amounts of time, attention, and special skills and are not scalable.  This thrust seeks to develop and increase the use of automation to simplify the completion of these tasks.  Example activities include automation of moving target defenses, code artifact reverse engineering, analysis of network flows at enterprise scale, and development and assessment of workforce skills.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Offices (PEO) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts. 

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEO for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts – providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.

This effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1 and 5000.02.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of High Performance Propulsion rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large High Performance Propulsion motors.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>AAW focuses on the development and demonstration of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies for improving Insensitive Munitions (IM) of AAW munitions.  The development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies, when applied to munitions, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, new ingredient synthesis and characterization, initial formulation development, scale-up, warhead/charge configuration, venting techniques for both munitions and their containers, protection/packaging materials and systems, shock mitigation liners, and initiation devices, techniques, and technologies.  Applications vary, but include high performance warhead fills, booster explosives, and all other technology to mitigate the violent response of AAW munitions to IM threats.  Munition operating conditions may be controlled or have widely varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and vibration, and other factors such as cost, availability, and reliability may be critically important depending on the intended munition application. The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the AAW MATGs are concentrated on solving the IM response of anti-armor warheads to the Fragment Impact and Slow Cook-off, threats for larger and Medium Caliber Munitions.</r2:Description>

This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to technology maturity and demonstrate the technologies to technological maturity utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three Technology Areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S. Defense and interagency users, as well as international partners through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation. CTTS is expanding its partnerships with other Defense rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users. 
CTTS major area of emphasis during FY18 and FY19 will be projects to Counter-ISIL.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.
Specific CTTS areas of emphasis in FY18 and FY19 include Counter-tunnel, Countering-sUAVs, improving digital operations at the tactical level, increasing lethality of small weapons and ammunition, and addressing threats to commercial aviation.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. 
The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&amp;E and provide innovative products.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program Element (PE) focuses on Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) and Proof of Principle prototypes derived from evaluation of foreign equipment that will provide the U.S. Armed Services, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and Defense agencies capabilities to counter emerging threats. FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries enables development of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable solutions for the Department of Defense (DoD), Multi-Service and Combatant Command (CCMD) priority requirements. FCT also increases competition, ensuring our personnel have access to the best technology available.

Service Requirements Review Board (SRRB) efficiencies are included.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FCT program supports the warfighter by leveraging technologies and equipment developed by allied nations and coalition partners to counter emerging threats, thereby enhancing U.S. warfighting capabilities while lowering U.S. development costs and accelerating the DoD acquisition process. FCT supports DoD best practices by incentivizing the use of prototyping and experimentation in advancing technological solutions to warfighter problems and acts as a hedge against threat developments. FCT enhances interoperability, facilitates international collaboration, increases competition, and enables more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record. Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (DASD(EC&amp;P)), Comparative Technology Office (CTO). FCT projects are sponsored by the Military Services and USSOCOM. Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements and DoD priorities, a thorough market survey, and an emphasis on transitioning technologies into current or future programs of record.

The FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries. Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. Defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement. The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States. To date, companies from 34 states benefited from FCT projects.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) mounted system enables Army and Marine Corps forces to support joint force freedom of movement and action through the projection of power from land into the maritime domain. Currently, there is no mobile, land-based, over-the-horizon, anti-ship warfare capability. The goal of this project is to evaluate an asset that could fill this critical capability gap. In 4Q FY 2017, a contract was awarded to procure the launcher and missile system from the vendor.</r2:Description>

The HALO system is an add-on image processor that enhances existing camera streams to allow for continuous standard and Infrared (IR) image “fusion” and a significant reduction in motion blur for the CROWS. The CROWS equipped with a HALO system will increase lethality and force protection by greatly improving image clarity and target recognition capability; and increase surveillance capability in a degraded visual environment. During FY 2017, test items and data characterization equipment were procured.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>FCT will invest in cross-domain, innovative, non-traditional technologies for new and emerging capabilities from international partners to enable cost-leveraging, increase competition, and provide more efficient solutions for our forces during maneuver and engagement operations. Solutions will reduce U.S. reliance on overleveraged blue capabilities and creatively exploit increasingly capable adversary systems while adjusting the cost curve in our favor. Applications of particular interest are those able to provide an innovative technology offset and/or cost calculus advantage. Our allies have made particular progress in the development of systems that offer a significant cost advantage in procurement or operation and reduce the amount of manpower necessary to effectively conduct operations. In addition, FCT will continue to seek out increased interoperability across platforms and systems. These technologies will be likely candidates for evaluation under the FCT program.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, advanced and disruptive explosive, fuzing, weapons effects, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable significant improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment.  The DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched, at a minimum, dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers that develop technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of munitions laboratory technical directors and senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD gaps, needs, and challenges.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 32 current projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions and system design and evaluation, including evaluation of lethality, vulnerability and the design of energetic materials (EM) and insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, formulation, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.

Each of the 32 projects has a detailed five year plan with objectives, tasks, deliverables and milestones that is approved annually by a group of 20-plus SES from the DoD munitions laboratories.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Projects in this technical focus area develop physics-based computational tools, material models, and calibration and validation databases that support the design and development of weapon systems.  These capabilities are intended to predict the complex phenomena across significant length (meso to continuum) and time (nano-seconds to minutes) scales.  The tools will provide coupled, multi-physics and chemistry modeling capabilities that are scalable to massively parallel architectures for solving diverse problems across the weapons systems’ research and development and acquisition communities.  Numeric tools are the foundation that makes possible the integration of mechanics, materials science, physics, and chemistry.  This focus area also includes an extensive experimental component consisting of:  1) phenomenological or “discovery” experiments that provide the physics basis for model development, 2) experiments directly coupled to model development and application, such as characterization, calibration, and validation experiments, or 3) the development of advanced test methods or device development.

The specific projects in computational mechanics and material modeling are:
-  CTH (Sandia code) shock physics and Sierra/Solid Mechanics (SM) codes &amp; model development and supporting experiments.
-  Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Three-Dimensional (ALE3D) code and model development.
-  Composite case technology and modeling.
-  Dynamic properties of materials, modeling and validation.
-  Energetic materials and polymers under dynamic and thermal loading.
-  Fragment impact and response experiments.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Title>Energetic Materials (EM)</r2:Title>
                                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new Energetic Materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects and improved lethality.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in part by recommendations of the Long Range Research and Development Program Plan (LRRDPP) and the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining and improving lethality, effects, and safety.  

In order to clearly establish overmatch, the Department is working to increase the range and speed of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  This thrust includes the development of hypersonic and hyper-velocity weapons.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  DoD may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and the ability to initiate weapons under extreme conditions.

TCG-III is also a forum for the exchange of information on new energetic materials, their performance and sensitivity characteristics, and physical models that can be used to predict the behavior of energetics under adverse and unplanned conditions.  It is a venue in which collaboration opportunities can be identified to facilitate the transition of technology developed in the DOE to the DoD.

                                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems.  Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. 

The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports the development of new warheads and penetrator weapons through advances in materials processing and characterization, instrumentation, and computational codes.  Significant increases in warhead performance are directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. 

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength, high performance, and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.

The specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area for FY 2018 are:
-  Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.
-  Dynamic behavior of concrete.
-  Integrated munitions modeling &amp; experimentation for penetration and MBX target coupling.
-  Modeling of strategic structures subject to ballistic impact or blast.

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating, predicting, and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:
-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.
-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.
-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.
-  Complex system health assessment.
-  Physical/chemical reactive transport modeling of material/system aging and reliability.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) directly supports The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&amp;E)) and OUSD Acquisition and Sustainment with assessments and analysis to inform the strategic direction of research, development, and acquisition of innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats from the diverse range of state and non-state actors confronting the Unites States. Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. 

The analysis process addresses the following Joint and Cross-Cutting missions: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assess counter technology options, and provide an operational value assessment; and 3) Development of Analytic Tools to help understand complex and longer term challenges. The Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). 

Typically, the ratios of resources applied to Operational and Technical Assessments, Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team, and development of Analytic Tools will be roughly 30/60/10 percent.  Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the Combatant Commands.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These areas include: space and terrestrial-based indications and warnings systems, integrated and resilient Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, strategic lift, long-range precision strike weapons, missile defense technologies, undersea systems, remotely operated vehicles and technologies, special operations forces, the Cyber Mission Force, ground systems, and others outlined in the 2016 National Military Strategy. Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. The emerging nature of the problem sets makes specific identification of all the study projects beyond the budget year unlikely. Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year-to-year.
 
Operational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2018-2038 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
- KCA across Defense Planning Scenarios and other relevant DOD Vignette to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace. 
- Developed and maintain an all source-like database of military capabilities and a standalone software application, KCA Results Display System, to provide data and analysis on operational issues.
- Produce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.
- Consolidate Technology focused roadmaps of US capability development and S&amp;T developmental strategic plans. 

Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD/DoE) laboratories. Using these research performers, previously sponsored research on relevant topics is leveraged in the new research providing value and experience on new projects. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-  Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.
-  Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies. 
-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability.
-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.
Analytic Tools include modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A), computer based engineering models, and purposed designed equipment to demonstrate or confirm theoretical performance of technical concepts. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-  Develop analytic tools to inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.
-  Develop strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.
-  Integrated MS&amp;A leveraging Service- and Agency–level virtual and constructive resources to provide insight into complex acquisition and operational decisions.
-  Red Teaming existing and planned US capabilities and weapons systems using emerging threat systems and capabilities in emerging scenarios.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In a partnership endeavor across the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Services, the Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies, SCO combines capability innovation with concepts of operation and information management to develop novel, high-leverage approaches to address pressing national security challenges.  SCO conducts projects on accelerated timelines, at any classification or access level.  

The Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts Program Element supports development, studies, analysis, and demonstration of integrated concepts and prototypes, analysis in support of ongoing efforts to shape and counter emerging threats, cross-Service and cross-Defense/Intelligence concepts, and red-teaming.  Projects focus on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major systems, and may involve risk reduction initiatives.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) has a long history of technological breakthroughs and innovations originating from within the Department.  In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that will be a source of battlefield advantage, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation.  

Leveraging innovative technologies from commercial startup companies has the potential to rapidly address warfighter problem sets in areas where commercial innovation outstrips government investment in the same technology areas. Through a unique partnership with other government agencies, we gain access to and vetting of innovative technologies from commercial startup companies where much of the research and development (R&amp;D) funds are provided by the venture capital community.  Small DoD investments in these companies, often in partnership with other U.S. Government agencies, further leveraging the dollars spent, provides short work programs to adapt the commercial technologies for warfighter applications. The deliverables from the work program allow the warfighters to rapidly pilot technology and concepts, with the ability to fail early and cheaply, and provide the avenue to refine warfighter requirements and transition technology from successful pilots to traditional DoD activities for integration into broader R&amp;D efforts or acquisition programs of record.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program focuses on three main areas: 1) Core Datahub pilot program; 2) Expansion of the Datahub pilot program to address the issues in the rest of the DoD 4+1 problem sets; and 3) Further innovation across other warfighter problem sets. 

Core Datahub pilot program.  This effort focuses on maturing and demonstrating the automated processing of  space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Artificial Intelligence-driven Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Fix-Find-Finish-Exploit-Assess (F3EA) into an integrated capability to aid the Combatant Commander and Component forces in defeating threats posed by nuclear-capable, mobile missile - a problem set often plagued by sparse data.  The approach is composed of three innovative building blocks:  1)  Machine learning techniques applied to commercial GEOINT and other commercial data sources for automated country-wide anomaly and change detection - crucial element for enhancing  indications and warnings required for precision strikes; 2)  Machine-Human collaboration architecture to accelerate the F3EA joint forces targeting and decision-making cycle; and 3)  Autonomous weaponeering demonstration - Exercise secure (C2S) cloud for timely precision strikes to hold mobile missile systems at risk.

Expansion of the Datahub Pilot Program.  Following a successful demonstration of Datahub and its leverage of commercial data sources and automation in early 2017, the team was directed to expand Datahub to address applicable issues in the remainder of the DoD 4+1 problem sets.  Some of these problem sets may leverage similar technologies to the pilot program, with data coverage for different parts of the world and algorithms tuned for different targets of interest, while other problem sets may require completely different data, algorithms, and/or technologies.  Although FY 2017 funding was only 50% of what was expected, the team is executing preliminary efforts to execute the expansion when FY 2018 funds become fully available. 

Innovation for other warfighter problem sets:  Through the unique partnership in place for this effort, DoD is exposed to a wide variety of emerging commercial technologies which have potential applicability to a wide spectrum of DoD problem sets.  Enabling the warfighter to execute short duration pilots with these evolving technologies provides a cost effective way to leverage commercial investment for DoD purposes, informing warfighter requirements for follow-on acquisition through traditional DoD channels, and allowing DoD R&amp;D organizations to focus their resources on both the integration of commercial technologies showing promise in these warfighter pilots, and on traditional R&amp;D in technologies not well served by the commercial start-up companies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>To counter the United States’ historic technological advantage, adversaries are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices that have become globally available.  These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, small unmanned air systems, and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems such as advanced sensor systems, advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) components and systems, advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles that can diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.

The rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and the myriad of new advanced Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats have made operations in the EMS significantly more difficult and complex.  The challenges posed by new kinetic and non-kinetic EMS threats and the dire consequences of technology surprise highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can rapidly address these new threats in more cost-effective ways.

The Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program was established to address these challenges through efforts designed to significantly accelerate the development and transitioning of new EW and EW-Cyber capabilities.  To do this, the JEAT program explores, assesses, and validates a plethora of new technologies and approaches focusing specifically on technologies and approaches that fall outside the Services’ Research and Development (R&amp;D) programs or are being developed by the Services at rates that cannot not produce required capabilities in the needed timeframes to identify the most fruitful EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D opportunities for the Department.  To identify potential nearer-term and lower-cost solutions, the JEAT program also explores and assesses approaches that integrate and demonstrate off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways.  The JEAT program’s approaches have provided substantial savings for the Services and the Department in both R&amp;D efforts and in Programs of Record, and thus enable required military capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible in traditional DoD approaches. 

JEAT program efforts are focused in four areas in two Project Codes.

•	In Project 619, Joint Electronic Advanced Technology, (1) the Experimentation/Demonstration effort utilizes innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to understand current and future threats and explore potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities, (2) the Advanced Technology Development/Verification effort explores technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways, and (3) the EW Collaboration and Planning effort ensures appropriate coordination and technological oversight of Department and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D programs and processes and provides governance insights for senior decision makers.

•	In Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation, (4) this effort explores computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies, tools, and approaches to enhance awareness and accelerate planning and decision making in essential EMS war fighting capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Electronic Advanced Technology project (Project 619) explores and assesses innovative technologies and approaches to rapidly mitigate advanced threats and demonstrate new overmatch technologies in ways not being explored by the Services.  Project 619’s three efforts, Experimentation/Demonstration (Expt/Demo), Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V), and Electronic Warfare Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P), focus on enabling nearer-term technology transitions to the Services’ Programs of Record (PoR) with reduced risk and cost.  Expt/Demo efforts focus on exploring, demonstrating, and assessing innovative technologies and approaches to overcome existing and developing threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for the U.S. military.  ATD/V efforts integrate advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in ways not being explored by the Services to demonstrate nearer-term technological opportunities.  EW C&amp;P efforts within Electronic Warfare and Countermeasures Office (EWCO) of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering assess, ensure coordination, and provide senior leadership insights on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber Research and Development (R&amp;D) as well as coordinating national and international EW and EW-Cyber efforts. 

Experimentation/Demonstration (Expt/Demo):

Expt/Demo explores and demonstrates new EW and EW-Cyber technologies and approaches through the use of large-scale, dynamic field experimentation venues.  The current venue, Vigilant Hammer (VH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive event focused on advancing the state of the art for detecting, classifying, geolocating, and engaging of electromagnetic signals of interest.  Modeled after Project 619’s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, VH includes both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new capabilities and approaches to engage emerging Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats.  Follow-on venues will address concerns such as multi-platform/multi-aperture, collaborative/coherent EW and multistatic passive/active sensing architectures.

Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V):

ATD/V explores, matures and assesses emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs.  Project 619’s ongoing ATD/V effort, the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory, explores, matures and assesses emerging EW and EW-Cyber technologies to enable, for example, multi-aperture collaborative/coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment through exquisite coordination of sensing and electronic attack capabilities. 

EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P):

EW C&amp;P supports all activities of the Director, EWCO, related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of all EW and EW-Cyber-related efforts across DoD.  EW C&amp;P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, and the Services on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD.  To do this, EW C&amp;P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensor, seeker, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures, and battle management technologies.  EW C&amp;P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&amp;S)) on PoR, including technology maturity and availability, Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure, and Technical Signals Requirements.  EW C&amp;P also conducts and leads analyses of advanced threats and technological opportunities to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D research, development and acquisition efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Our next Expt/Demo venue will focus on assessing the performance of passive/active sensing architectures in a complex and congested environment.  As with VH and all earlier Project 619 experimentation venues, subsequent venues will be scoped to address the most pressing EMS threats and the selection of venue topics and the scoping of these efforts will involve the EW and Cyber Communities of Interest and Executive Committees (EXCOMs) to ensure maximum relevance and benefits to Departmental efforts.</r2:Description>

Project 619 continues interfacing with the Intelligence Community (IC) at senior levels to address critical intelligence gaps related to foreign EMS capabilities and advanced technology development efforts.  Project 619 also assessed alternative courses of action for employing advanced, adaptive, and cognitive EW technologies that are being developed and marketed commercially for data communications, radar, and other advanced spectrum domains previously dominated by DoD.  Emerging concepts and technologies from the R&amp;E Reliance Process and the EW Science and Technology Community of Interest road maps were assessed for their potential impact and value.  Analysis and coordination of national and international efforts addressing emerging Information Operations and EW-Cyber Convergence topics were addressed as well as efforts to advance technologies that provide countermeasures to imaging infrared seekers and expand U.S.-Australia collaboration in EW-Cyber.  These efforts guided planning of Non-Kinetic Battle Management and Visualization Technology research efforts in Project 245 of this Program Element.

In addition to continued participation in ongoing efforts mentioned above, FY 2018 efforts include the development of a variety of new EW capabilities including distributed cooperative or coherent aperture techniques; battle management and visualization technologies for optimization of non-kinetic fires; asymmetric targeting technologies; passive system countermeasure techniques; and national technical means applications to EW.  Efforts will also guide planning of future EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation (Project 245) research efforts.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program addresses Joint and Combatant Commands (CCMDs) warfighting needs through the execution and demonstration of prototypes within two to four years of the identification of a need.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes to the field for military utility assessment (MUA) to affordably operationalize technologies that enable warfighters to explore novel concepts and to facilitate informed transition to formal programs of record (PoR) when appropriate.  Based on the results of the assessments, performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are either “left behind” for additional assessments or operational use, transition to a PoR, or returned to the technical baseline inventory.

The key tenets of the program are in alignment with the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering USD(R&amp;E) guiding principles to: shape major technology investments within DoD, focus on joint and cross-cutting missions, prove new concepts of operation, inform and or validate requirements, leverage open systems architectures, and identify accelerated paths to acquisition.    

The JCTD program achieves this by engaging the interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the Department of Defense's (DoD) access to innovation.  It serves as the vehicle for CCMDs to address Joint strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment, which often fall into the seams between the military Services and DoD agencies.  JCTD investments are informed by the CCMDs’ integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessment provided by the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps.

In FY 2017, the JCTD program successfully completed the MUA and transition of several JCTD prototypes that fielded affordable and sustainable solutions to meet immediate operational needs.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:
•	The JCTD Program has executed 113 JCTDs from FY 2006 to present.  The data shows a transition rate for the program of 81 percent with 52 percent of capabilities transitioning to a PoR, 25 percent to operational fielding, and 4 percent to General Services Administration (GSA) schedule.  The remaining 19 percent were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations while rapidly accelerating game changing technology/capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Previously funded JCTD.  Low Cost Missile Defeat (LCMD) is a ballistic missile defense system designed to counter current and emerging weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats.  LCMD program execution has been structured using a building block approach; the FY 2015 step was a technology demonstration effort under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (DASD (EC&amp;P)) to accelerate technology maturation.  The concept of operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability would augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.  Funding was allocated for participation in the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Low Cost Interceptor Study (LCIS) and risk reduction for key technologies, including the seeker and thrust vane subsystems, modeling and simulation of subsystem design capabilities, and limited prototyping for component flight boards and gimbals.  Results from the LCIS indicated there are more cost effective and viable options for a low cost interceptor.  Accordingly, DoD discontinued the LCMD program and saved the intellectual property and data package for future BMD development efforts.  The LCMD JCTD was closed out in late FY 2017.</r2:Description>

The balance of FY 2017 funds are being held pending completion of the AoA.  Future LCMD development will be informed by the results of the AoA with funding for development in the out years coming from the JCTD Concept Development / Pre-EMD Prototypes.</r2:Text>

This effort is comprised of three programs that support the entire JCTD Program, separate from the specific JCTD projects.  The three programs are (1) Unified CCMD Direct Support, (2) JCTD Pre-Transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD Direct Support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project development, demonstration, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling the CCMDs to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  Executes a select number of classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness (SSA) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance.</r2:Description>

This project area shows a rise in funding from FY 2017/FY 2018 into FY 2019.  The reason for the increase is because, during the years of execution (FY 2017/FY 2018), projects are selected, funded and displayed separately in this R-2, thus reducing FY 2017/2018 funding in this focus area.  The reality is that total funding supporting this focus area is level to slightly up.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

ET investments are small (average $0.500M), short (less than one year) efforts that may lead to a prototype, depending on the final assessment and determination of technical maturity.  Examples of ETs funding in FY 2017 include:  1) The Autonomous Mission Package Planning and Execution (AMPEE), a risk reduction effort for a FY 2017 autonomy focused JCTD.  AMPEE demonstrated a mission planning system and the ability to conduct cognitive netted distributed electronic warfare on multiple class unmanned aerial systems.  2) Scanning Infrared Sensor for Unmanned Air Vehicle Detection and Tracking (SISUDT), a prototype fixed-site, multi-sensor counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) to detect, track, and identify group one and two UASs near forward operating bases.  One SISUDT prototype was deployed in support of Operation Inherent Resolve for an in-theater validation of infrared UAS detection.  3) Strike Awareness for Gray Zones (STAGE) a risk mitigation effort to address shortfalls in the STAGE JCTD proposal by defining a management structure, technical approach, and transition plan for the effort.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Previously funded JCTD.  HALO uses high altitude, low-cost balloons as communication relays in denied environments.  It accomplished this by using the ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency spectrum and techniques that allow non-attribution to the source of the UHF signals.  The advanced technology resides at the user terminals on the ground, which receive data from the balloon-platforms, and subsequently perform the processing and communication receiver functions that allow effective two-way communication in a contested environment.  HALO received partner funds from U.S. Air Force Air Combat Command and U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center.  In FY 2017, HALO completed the development of the hardware and software payloads for the balloons.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Successful JCTDs can transition to acquisition via one of several methods:
-  The JCTD addresses a documented capability gap in an existing program of record (PoR).  The existing PoR can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing PoR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.
-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
-  The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.
-  Results of JCTD can be used to inform the research and engineering, acquisition, or requirements process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Strategic Goals Supported:
-  Develop and demonstrate a prototype that fills a joint capability gap. 
-  Demonstrate a capability to address a DoD key strategic gap. 
-  Develop a prototype that informs the acquisition and requirements process. 
-  Independent Assessment Capability.
-  Successful military utility assessment (MUA).

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
• JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24-48 months: 
• The JCTD program will continue to achieve high transition rates.  In FY 2017, 50 percent of completed JCTDs successfully transitioned and exceeded the DoD Strategic Performance goal of 40 percent.  Two of six completed JCTDs transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record.  One transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  Three were returned to the technology base for further analysis and/or future use.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) will be adversely affected during operations in contested Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) environments.  The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare capable of advanced jamming and signal collection techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  Department of Defense (DoD) advances in smart sensors and smart weapons have an urgent need for more resilient networks than tactical data links of today.  In FY 2016, the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) returned with a new focus on developing enabling technologies for Joint assured communications networks.  The goals of this program are: to mitigate degradation across battlespace tiers and domains and to provide agility that will support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and deployed forces.
 
The DoD’s current TDLs platforms and capabilities are not sufficiently protected from emerging adversary threats and contain insufficient capacity for future needs.  In order to enable the promise of net-centric operations for the warfighter, the next generation of airborne, surface, and ground tactical networks must provide greater affordability, higher network capacity, greater durability against electronic attack, better network connectivity, and faster response times to the changing demands from airborne, maritime, and ground users.  Many line-of-sight (LOS), beyond LOS, and SATCOM waveforms have been integrated onto platforms for various missions.  These waveforms necessarily exhibit tradeoffs in target performance attributes including capacity, latency, protection, and complexity.  As a result, no single waveform capability will be able to satisfy all emerging mission needs emphasizing the need for interoperability and software defined waveforms.  The challenge is to understand the essential needs of the users, avoid needless redundancy, develop affordable capabilities, and integrate separate capabilities into a cohesive network.  This research will develop transformative technologies to ensure performance in contested A2/AD environments by focusing on future communications networks that are a “leap ahead” of today’s capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In a contested environment, especially when conducting forward operations, platforms face a significant electronic warfare threat.  The primary threat is from advanced jamming, signal collection, and geolocation techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  DoD advances in smart sensors and weapons demand robust tactical waveforms and networks with greater capacity but lower cost than communication links of today.

The Future Autonomous Battlespace RF with Integrated Communications (FABRIC) (formerly referred to as Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM)) program will develop next generation communications layer architecture for tactical networks for operations in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat environments.  This architecture will deliver capacity and affordability to enable future smart sensors and smart weapons.  The network architecture will be flexible enough to support Commander’s Intent in any mission, environment, operating tactical platform, and weapon system under various threat conditions.  FABRIC’s efforts will focus on developing the advanced component technologies, such as Anti-Jam(AJ), Low Probability of Interference (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) waveforms; adaptive processing algorithms; adaptive antenna technologies (transmit/receive/nulling); adaptive power control; Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)/Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) techniques; self-healing mechanisms and cyber hardening; and advanced routing to ensure Quality of Service.  The guiding tenets for creating this new Command, Control, Communications, Computers, &amp; Intelligence (C4I) capability encompass enabling new missions, i.e. providing  resilient tactical data links, communications and networking “service level” capabilities, interoperation, cost (affordable), and improved performance in terms of military value.

Based on the developed thresholds and objectives for the required network architecture, the specific advanced component technologies were prioritized and form the foundation of the FABRIC design.  Through simulation and field experimentation, FABRIC will verify the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and facilitate the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project will investigate and develop flexible, high performance, and affordable technologies for the tactical network, supporting capability changes as a mission progresses from phase to phase.  The project will develop and mature technologies to support direct transition of the algorithms, prototype implementations, waveform improvements, and system design improvements to radio, waveform, and weapon systems programs managed by each military department.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T) program is the joint, defense-wide component of the DoD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program directed in Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2521, the latter of which represents the Department’s comprehensive advanced manufacturing program focused on enabling the strategic goals of timely, affordable delivery of dominant technologies to the warfighter, and improving the acquisition and sustainment of defense products and systems across their life cycles.  Designing for manufacturability early in the development of defense-essential products and systems can yield dramatic and positive impacts for the Department’s operational and modernization missions. 
			
The DMS&amp;T component of the DoD ManTech program specifically focuses on the development of cross-cutting and potentially game-changing manufacturing technologies, processes and capabilities that are typically beyond the scope or risk of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform.These high-leverage, defense-wide investments are designed to benefit the performance, affordability, and delivery timelines/deployment cycles of many of the department’s most essential products and systems in ways that are not typically achievable through the efforts of a single service, agency or program office.
			
The DMS&amp;T program, therefore, is a unique and fundamental DoD ManTech Program component that is needed to optimize a coordinated manufacturing technology development process across the department broadly.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes and capabilities along with S&amp;T development enables the timely, affordable adoption and deployment of emerging technologies needed to maintain U.S. warfighting dominance.  Key DMS&amp;T technical areas for investment include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing, and respective technology focus areas addressed by each of the DoD-led manufacturing innovation institutes (discussed in the next paragraph).  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design/qualification/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.

Manufacturing innovation institutes established by the DoD and part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program are also funded in this program element. Technical innovation and leadership in U.S. manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of industrial competitiveness to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. Eight DoD Manufacturing USA institutes have been established to serve as regional hubs accelerating technological innovation and associated production processes and educational/workforce competencies for military and commercial applications via shared public-private sectors.  These Manufacturing USA institutes, supported by resources from multiple U.S. Government agencies, are generating significant industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and are forming new technology transition pathways via regional hubs spurring active collaboration among government, industry, and academia to help meet critical government and warfighter needs. The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President’s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) ”National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan” and 3) “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,” both published in February 2016.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DMS&amp;T investment strategy follows a two-pronged approach built on: 1) broad technology initiatives  and 2) specific individual projects meeting more focused manufacturing technology needs.  Investments in both cases are built and managed in collaboration with the Department’s research, development and acquisition (RDA) communities (including active, ongoing coordination with the DoD ManTech Program’s Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel) and industry and target the development of defense-essential advanced manufacturing processes and associated workforce capabilities.  The portfolio includes a focus on above-the-shop-floor new manufacturing processes and practices having the potential to improve manufacturing efficiencies at broader, enterprise levels. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to more surgically apply investments to compelling and sometimes urgent manufacturing needs.
 			
Data calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements, and then down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through funding opportunity announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including "above the shop floor" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP,and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Electronics and Optics is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Focal points are productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base to accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs. Future efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, lasers, enhanced acuity microdisplays, and transparent ceramics for opto-mechanical and armor applications.

The Transparent Ceramic Initiative will address DoD applications for electro-optics, including fibers, films, and bulk solid state components, such as windows. Typical materials include: sapphire, ALON, and spinel. Transparent ceramics offer the potential for improved ballistic strength for battlefield armor and personnel protection. Investments include but are not limited to: high strength spinel scale-up, Nanocomposite Optical Ceramics (NCOC) powder scale-up, infrared windows, and curved transparent ceramics.

                                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Materials Manufacturing is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, and metamaterials.  Through productivity and efficiency gains, these manufacturing technologies will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, while reducing the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.  Advanced materials manufacturing technologies undergoing development include materials for ballistic survivability and ballistic protection, survivability and rapid fabrication of structural components.

Advanced Propulsion Initiative: Advance propulsion has a crucial need to develop fuel efficient sustainable propulsion capabilities. Several technologies will be developed including Risk-based Life Cycle Management for System Sustainment and As-Manufactured and As-Maintained State Awareness. In addition, technologies will be pursued addressing capability gaps associated with adaptive engine design and high performance lightweight materials, organic matrix composites, oxide/oxide composites, thermal barrier coatings for high temperature structure and light weight alloys. Additional capabilities will focus on unique manufacturing challenges associated with affordable Medium-Small Engine fabrication methods including Expendables.

Projects:
40MM M433 Warhead Producibility (FY 2016): Achieve improved anti-personnel lethality at the squad level, increasing first shot effectiveness against personnel targets through optimization of production process prior to transition to Full Rate Production, avoiding high cartridge unit costs.  Primary applications include Mk 19 GMG, M203 GL, M320GL, and M32 MSGL. Secondary applications include Cannon and Tank Calibers, and Hand Grenades.  
Cold Spray Repair and Rebuild Phase II Large Structures (FY 2016): Expand the Cold Spray product envelope from 5 feet to a target of 40 feet to enable large tubular component repair. Applications include Seawolf Class Submarine Periscopes and TD-63 Actuators.

Dimensions on Day One (FY 2016): Demonstrate a methodology that accurately predicts and accounts for the numerous geometric, tooling and material factors impacting finished composite parts enabling the correct upfront process and tooling design to yield first article parts meeting the “dimensional requirements on day 1”. Applications include F-35/UCLASS/F/A-XX/Long Range Strike for maintaining part and aircraft tolerances, which enables survivable, supportable and affordable air vehicles. 

Large Scale Encapsulate Ceramics - Phase II (FY 2016): Enable combat vehicles to defeat the large caliber Kinetic and Chemical Energy objective threats within the allocated weight parameters.  Help address affordability of the armor, with an estimated cost reduction of $10K /sq. foot. Armor panels will be producible in the shapes required by individual vehicles. Applications include Abrams, which has a known protection limitation. GCV and other vehicles will use this technology to design those areas of vehicles subject to large caliber KE and CE threats.

Out of Autoclave Processing of Organic Matrix Composites (OMCs) for Advanced Propulsion (FY 2017-2018): Current state of the art out of autoclave processable OMCs are currently limited to a service life of between 325F and 375F limiting advanced propulsion applications. Expanding performance of OMCs to temperatures between 400F and 625F will dramatically increase the design trade space for developing the next generation advanced propulsion systems. Advanced propulsion structure includes front frames, vanes, stators and outer by-pass ducts. Insertion of this technology onto the AETP program will lower cost, increase range and maintain performance for the next generation tactical aircraft.

Fabrication of Non-Eroding Metallic Throat (FY 2016-2018): Scale the manufacturing of Thin walled, Non-Eroding Tungsten (W) Throats from 4” up to 12” inner throat diameters. Applications include Stage 2 &amp; Stage 3 ICBMs as well as Stage 2 Standard Missile III.

Advanced Technology Capability (FY 2016-2018): Development of advanced technologies that support warfighter survivability and capability against advanced threats. Enables new capabilities to be produced in sufficient affordable quantities to allow transition to multiple platforms.

                                                    <r2:Description>Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  Projects selected will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations while reducing cost, acquisition time, and risk of major defense acquisition programs.

It is paramount for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access computer-aided design (CAD) for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.

Emerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  a large-scale challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between the Government and contractors.

Projects:
MTConnect Challenge Phase II (FY 2016): Promote academia’s educational development and implementation of production interactive solutions to the broad U.S industrial base with the expansion of MTConnect Challenge that contributes to reduced cycle times and the development of real-time production metrics for adaptable dashboard applications.

Securing American Manufacturing (SAM) (FY 2016): develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base.
Cyber Security for the Shop Floor - Phase II (FY 2017-2018): The manufacturing factory floor is a growing area of concern for DoD cyber security because defense contractors throughout the DoD's supply chain are continually targeted by cyber criminals seeking to: 1) steal technical data, including critical national security information and valuable commercial intellectual property; 2) alter data, thereby affecting processes and products; and 3) impair or deny process control, thereby damaging or shutting down operations. Protecting the operational systems of a manufacturing enterprise presents a different set of challenges from protecting enterprise IT systems and networks.  This phase II project will develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technological innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic competitiveness to maintain technological advantage and global dominance for our military. To support these goals, Manufacturing USA institutes, each led by non-profit 501(c) entities, have been established by the Department to serve as national assests with headquarters and regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial applications and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DOE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of these Manufacturing USA institutes  will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President’s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) ”National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan” and 3) “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,” both published in February 2016.

Each of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes addressed in this budget is expected to be self-sustaining, without reliance on federal sustainment funding, by the end of the period defined by the respective cooperative agreement (CA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) between the federal government and the non-profit organization leading each institute consortium of members.  This CA/TIA period is typically for five years, with the flexibility to extend the agreement up to two years for the benefit of DoD projects, technical achievement, etc., and to fully leverage the minimum 1:1 cost share.  

Each of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes is intended to: 
1) Bring together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state and local governments and organizations to create regionally-based but nationally-impactful public-private partnerships underpinning the formation of sustainable manufacturing innovation ecosystems
2) Accelerate innovation to bridge the gap between Research and Development (R&amp;D) and deployment of technological innovations in domestic production of goods
3) Invest in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, accelerating innovation within DoD and across all manufacturing sectors to increase U.S. competitiveness
4) Provide shared assets to help companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment 
5) Create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills
6) Focus on maturing the associated manufacturing technologies typically from from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 through 7

The first and second year of each of these new institutes is devoted to establishing a sustainable business model and operations, with continued refinement throughout the full period of the cooperative agreement, including: expanding the institute’s membership base (as appropriate); establishing and solidifying revenue streams (e.g., funding from new R&amp;D activity, membership fees, training and workforce development, certification and licensing, etc.); establishing provisional Executive Council and Technical Advisory committees to execute the business of each institute; finalizing Intellectual Property plans; developing technology roadmaps to inform investment strategies; opening industrial commons to provide for shared resource facilities available to all institute members; initiating workforce training programs in each technology area; establishing complementary relationships between Manufacturing USA institutes; analyzing the U.S. and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements; and further developing national technology roadmaps.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Advanced additive manufacturing will benefit the DoD by enabling lifecycle cost savings and enhanced capabilities, including moving toward “focused logistics” – getting the right part in the right place in just the right time – for wartime and humanitarian missions using local supply chains. This Manufacturing USA institutes was established in 2012, with cooperative agreement funding included in this budget through FY 2015, and DoD program management costs included in subsequent fiscal years until all R&amp;D projects, reporting, and fiduciary responsibilities are completed.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This institute is intended to advance state-of-the-art human tissue manufacturing innovations in cell and biomaterial processing, bioprinting, automation and non-destructive testing technologies. The motivation is to increase U.S. competitiveness in advanced tissue biofabrication manufacturing by encouraging insertion of disruptive technologies into multiple biotechnology sectors, streamlining integrated testing technologies and ultimately reducing the barrier to entry for new inventors. The goal is to establish a collaboration that will mature tissue-related technology across a range of manufacturing readiness levels (MRL) 4-7, enabling post-delivery assurance of tissue identity, viability, function, and efficacy. This Institute will bring together the diverse and currently fragmented collection of industry practices and institutional knowledge across many disciplines (cell biology, bioengineering, materials science, analytical chemistry, robotics, and quality assurance). Scaling up to commercial level production of tissues will require manufacturing and process automation suitable for living cells, as well as testing and preservation methods appropriate for tissue-based products with limited shelf-life and a narrow window of efficacy. 

Technical focus at a minimum will be comprised of four thrust areas: 1) Cell &amp; Material Selection &amp; Sourcing;  2) Biofabrication Platforms;  3) Process Design and Automation;  4) Tissue Finishing and Testing Technologies
This institute was established in late 2016.  Technology Investment Agreement funds are programmed in this budget from FY 2016 through FY 2022.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Each Manufacturing Innovation Institute is established through a competitive selection process.  The executing military department or agency, in close and continuous coordination with OSD ManTech, publishes a formal solicitation (funding opportunity announcement) for proposals describing the scope of required activities and extensive proposal evaluation criteria. Non-Profit Organizations (including universities) are eligible to bid, and each bidder forms a broad consortium of industry and academic partners. The executing military department or agency, in close coordination with OSD, uses a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selects a winning consortium.  The final terms of the cooperative agreement/technology investment agreement between the selectee and the federal government are then negotiated and the CA or TIA is signed.  Throughout and after completion of this process, the federal government makes clear that members of non-selected teams are encouraged to join the selected consortium as conditions permit.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessing the performance of the DoD-led manufacturing institutess, part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program, requires a multi-faceted view of ‘performance,’ given the program’s layered base of DoD, government-wide, and national level public-private stakeholders and interests. Notwithstanding this complexity, the Department is careful to maintain orientation with the DoD ManTech program’s statutory goals and objectives and has concluded that those requirements are highly complementary to, and supportive of, the broader national goals of the Manufacturing USA Program as laid out in the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014.  Performance relative to both sets of goals/objectives is necessarily measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and many of the institutes accomplishments previously addressed represent rich and highly descriptive qualitative and quantitative measure of program performance.  The Department actively reviews or oversees the review of institute metrics at four levels: 1) the overall Manufacturing USA network level (this is done in coordination with the DoD’s Manufacturing USA interagency partners), 2)  at the DoD/funding agency level (per the statutory requirements of DoD ManTech Program), 3) at the individual institute level (in coordination with each institute), and 4) at the specific technology project level (via DoD technical expert involvement in the institutes). Broadly, the institutes themselves are charged by the DoD, the Administration and Congress with ensuring that key elements of their innovation ecosystems will be matured and made widely available by fostering collaborations between appropriate elements of that ecosystem. The following four categories of metrics have emerged as common focus areas:
1.	Impact on U.S. Innovation Ecosystem
2.	Financial Leverage/Sustainability
3.	Education and Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development 
4.	Technical Advancement
Specific metrics and the annual cycle for measuring progress against benchmarks are developed for each institute consortium and reflect that institute’s unique technology capability, expertise, and organizational structure. The Department strives to ensure that the assessment process captures and articulates the benefits to national security based upon technological advancements and the industrial base.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The ECTD funding supports projects that reduce technology risk of emerging capabilities by advancing conceptual and operational prototypes in support of near- and mid-term operational engagements and stability operations.  With an emphasis on interagency and joint partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span one to three years through efforts that emphasize affordability, typically at a cost of less than $6.000 million.  The ECTD program focuses on rapid prototyping of emerging technologies to accelerate capabilities to the joint warfighter, including electromagnetic spectrum-agile capabilities; multi-domain, autonomous systems; counter-weapons of mass destruction capabilities; and, dismounted soldier systems.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman’s Gap Assessment, USD(R&amp;E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).

In anticipation of a heightened emphasis by the new USD(R&amp;E) on outpacing threats and seizing technical opportunities, ECTD is structured to mature emerging technologies and highlight their military capabilities through joint demonstrations and ECTD sponsored venues for defense-wide experiments and demonstrations.  These include Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance venue; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  Together, these events enable newly-developed capabilities to be showcased in realistic environments with operational user involvement.  The ECTD program supports red teaming efforts to identify vulnerabilities in emerging technologies early, ensuring follow-on systems are resilient to adversaries.

In response to changing Department of Defense priorities, two new project lines are being added to the ECTD PE.  The high energy laser (HEL) project will begin development work to integrate a HEL onboard an AC130 aircraft.  This will enhance special operations forces’ ability to provide precision fires.  The red teaming project line will assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies.  This will enable the new Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering to make informed decisions on building new capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This project will develop an extensible Advanced Electronic Warfare Laboratory (AEWL) technical framework that can be replicated at multiple Service labs and government research and development facilities.  The AEWL concept will support technical risk assessments of emerging blue force electronic warfare (EW) subsystems and system prototypes in a realistic electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) environment.  AEWL will support hardware-in-the-loop testing, enabling the Department of Defense to evaluate the effectiveness of prototype systems or subsystems against realistic signals early in development.  This effort includes the hardware and software implementation of the first instantiation of the AEWL technical framework.  In FY 2017, AEWL designed and procured final hardware components and subsystems and completed installation and integration of several prototype subsystems.</r2:Description>

The program is guided by focus areas identified by Combatant Commands, military Services, other defense organizations, and interagency partners.  Stiletto includes an experimental, all carbon fiber 88-foot boat that serves as a maritime demonstration platform.  The Stiletto program also includes other maritime platforms to assist in the exploration, assessment, and development of prototypes.  

Stiletto supports the rapid discovery and transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations, thereby increasing the speed of response to emerging threats.  The boat supports special operations forces, expeditionary forces, and interagency users by experimenting with new technologies and exploring their military utility to reduce the risk of emerging technologies and concepts of operation.  The Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program offers a streamlined experimentation and demonstration process that encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment, and to rapidly adapt new technologies to meet operational needs.  Stiletto annually demonstrates approximately 65 technologies resulting in about $4.000 million in cost avoidance.  In FY 2017, Stiletto conducted 14 demonstration and experimentation events focused on maritime electro-optical and infrared surveillance; counter unmanned underwater vehicles (C-UUV); and, maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance from unmanned aerial vehicles.  These events demonstrated 78 emerging technologies to 21 Department of Defense and interagency organizations.  The Stiletto vessel is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) funding supports projects requiring less than one million dollars for execution.  In FY 2017, ECTD selected, executed, and transitioned low cost innovative projects including:
•  Advanced Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM): A coherent countermeasure (CoCM) prototype using photonic technology to achieve a wide operational bandwidth, fast frequency tuning, and wide instantaneous bandwidth.  Additionally, the prototype provided sophisticated digital signal processing and generation of advanced CoCM waveforms and techniques.  The advanced DRFM transitioned to Naval Air Systems Command for further development. 
•  Persistics Software Enhancement: This project developed and delivered systems that automatically integrate and analyze open source imagery data to predict adversary behavior and track weapons of mass destruction in denied areas.  The capability transitioned to U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Special Operations Command.  Further project details are classified.
•  Multi-Thread Experiment (MTX):  Enabled concept experimentation with autonomous unmanned vehicles (UxVs) in an operationally-relevant, multi-domain environment.  Efforts focused on collaboration via a distributed control network, which parses sensing, control, navigation, and communication information through a network to achieve mission objectives.
•  Robust Airworthy Optical Systems:  This project integrated government-developed optical subsystems to inform design of a sub-scale operationally representative solid state laser (SSL) weapon system.  Related efforts will validate and test design performance in a simulated airborne flight environment.
•  Low-Cost Precision Intercept:  This project developed and demonstrated an ultra-low size, weight, power, and cost terminal guidance seeker.  The seeker was paired with a small unmanned aerial system to demonstrate a low-cost, long-range, terminally guided platform.  The capability transitioned to U.S. Special Operations Command for further development.  
•  United Nations (U.N.) Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Technology: A pilot project demonstrated the utility of integrating proven Department of Defense (DoD) technologies to enhance multilateral peacekeeping operations and improved DoD collaboration with the U.N. and other peacekeeping stakeholders.  U.N. PKO prototypes transitioned to deployed forces in the U.S. Africa Command and U.S. Central Command areas of responsibility.</r2:Description>

This project includes risk reduction efforts to help accelerate development and operational demonstration of an electric laser with a rechargeable magazine on an AC-130.  Activities covered by this funding include modeling, simulation, testing subsystems, and coordination with industry to support a subsequent USSOCOM HEL development program.  Success for the subsequent program will be realized by integrating an HEL capability into the AC-130 precision strike package (PSP).  The subsequent program will provide special operations forces with a materiel solution capable of addressing current warfighter gaps.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Red Teaming project helps assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies and systems with high payoff potential to address current technology shortfalls or future capability gaps.  The program supports field demonstrations and red-teaming to stress and assess emerging systems in key areas for gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life-cycle.  This project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats.  It informs requirements and helps accelerate acquisition pathways for joint missions.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, academia, and industry to develop a construct that current or future systems can be gamed against in a distributed, operationally-relevant environment employing traditional and non-traditional players.  Deliverables will inform technology acquisition and new concept of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Projects will explore unconventional approaches to counter DoD technologies through red teams, wargames, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.  Efforts range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants including warfighters, scientists, engineers, students, and academics.  Deliverables include recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new concepts of operations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Resilience, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training/readiness, sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Resilience, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high-priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  Technologies developed by SERDP enhance military operations, improve military systems’ effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, sustain DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and by reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  JWP supports partnership for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Component programs that equip forces for joint missions. The account underwrites analyses and studies,  limited-scope experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.   JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions. This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and affordable joint solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.   JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD, the Joint Staff and joint command counterparts, the AT&amp;L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on joint warfighting environments in the future.   

Typical projects funded with JWP include independent analysis and translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources support  analytic expertise on joint issues.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also supportthe development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts. 
The  JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  In many cases, JWP funds initiatives for process improvements serving all Components, but aligned with no single Service or Agency.  These early assessments and studies of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  JWP often represents the first effort to define integrated and innovative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities through cross-cutting analysis and studies in partnership with  the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L, Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.  It evolves analytic development of Joint Military Requirements addressing evolving threats / missions On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  JWP supports partnership for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Component programs that equip forces for joint missions. The account underwrites analyses and studies,  limited-scope experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.   JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions. This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and affordable joint solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.   JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD, the Joint Staff and joint command counterparts, the AT&amp;L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on joint warfighting environments in the future.   

Typical projects funded with JWP include independent analysis and translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources support  analytic expertise on joint issues.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also supportthe development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts. 
The  JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  In many cases, JWP funds initiatives for process improvements serving all Components, but aligned with no single Service or Agency.  These early assessments and studies of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  JWP often represents the first effort to define integrated and innovative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities through cross-cutting analysis and studies in partnership with  the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L, Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.  It evolves analytic development of Joint Military Requirements addressing evolving threats / missions On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) describes the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative. This program was originally established in the 1990s in response to the NDAA (FY99, Section 378 of Public Law 105-261) and granted additional authorities via Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13111) and other supporting publications (e.g., 10 U.S. Code §2249d). Organizationally, this PE reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&amp;T)). 

This PE provides policy oversight for distributed learning (e.g., online courses, smartphone-based learning, web browser–based simulations) and supports associated innovation, modernization, and coordination across DoD, Coalition partners (e.g., NATO), and other federal agencies. This work largely focuses on distributed learning interoperability (i.e., ensuring interagency technical and organizational systems function together) and helping agencies acquire new distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiency. Ultimately, this PE’s work promotes personnel readiness, helping the right people to receive the right training and education, at the right time—at the right cost. 

This PE’s work falls into three interrelated categories: (1) Modernization, (2) Documentation, and (3) Coordination. The “modernization” work involves Advanced Technology Development (6.3) in technical areas such as e-learning, mobile learning, learner modeling and analytics, and software interoperability. These efforts inform the PE’s “documentation” work, including the authoring and upkeep of technical guidance and policy documents, such as DoD Instruction 1322.26 (“Distributed Learning”) and software interoperability specifications. Finally, the documentation work drives “coordination” efforts, which consist of implementation support and interagency/interorganizational coordination. 

This PE’s modernization investments are driven by requirements collected from the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, a working group of military personnel and DoD/federal civilians (at the O-6 and GS-15 level) who represent their agencies’ distributed learning equities and are key stakeholders in shaping the direction of these agencies. These requirements are aligned to DoD/federal strategic direction, such as the Army Learning Concept for Training and Education for 2020–2040 (TP 525-8-2), Navy’s Sailor 2025, and Air Force Strategic Master Plan, and they are considered against emerging industry trends and technologies. 

This PE benefits DoD in three ways. (1) Interoperability: It strengthens interagency, interorganizational, and multinational interoperability by governing distributed learning interoperability policy, maintaining current technical reference guidelines, and fostering their implementation across communities of practice. (2) Efficiencies: It saves government resources by fostering unity of effort across DoD, other federal agencies, and Coalition Partners for distributed learning, eliminating duplications and identifying opportunities for interagency collaboration. (3) Learning Effectiveness: It helps improve training and education effectiveness by helping DoD, federal, and Coalition stakeholders acquire and implement emerging distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiently. In sum, this work supports the components’ training and education missions, helping them increase personnel readiness while driving down training and education portfolio costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program’s R&amp;D efforts improve efficiencies and reduce costs by reducing time spent in face-to-face instruction, allowing more time for practical application and repetition; increasing interoperability, which enables discovery, retrieval, and reuse of distributed learning content; and researching and prototyping methods of distributed learning with superior motivational and learning outcomes.</r2:Description>

This program is supporting its development by investigating the specifications and web-based digital services needed to make training and education technologies interoperable. In FY17, an early “Total Learning Architecture” prototype was tested with 75 Special Operators at Ft. Bragg. In FY18, this project will enter its second phase of development and will include additional empirical testing. 

Learning Data – In FY17, this program led a revision to DoD Instruction 1322.26, after extensive coordination with the Services and Joint Staff. The revised Instruction recommends the use of the Experience Application Programming Interface (xAPI), a technical specification that enables data exchange across training and education technologies. In FY18, this program will continue to refine the xAPI specification for semantic interoperability and will coordinate with stakeholders to deliver the implementation guidance, conformance testing tools, learning analytics, and data visualization capabilities they need to make most use of it. In FY18, this work is also expected to inform updates to DoD Instruction 1322.26’s fungible technical references.

Competencies and Credentialing – In FY17, this program investigated competency and credentialing management technologies, and it prototyped a web-based competency framework tool as part of the Total Learning Architecture demonstration. In FY18, this PE will continue its coordination efforts across defense and federal agencies for competency-based learning, and it will continue working with professional specifications and standards bodies in development of associated interoperability specifications to aid permeability across organizational boundaries. 

Personal Assistant for Learning – Adaptive learning tools promise to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of training and education, and these tools are critical parts of DoD’s modern “learning ecosystem” vision. This program examines the science and technology needed to design such capabilities, using open-architecture and open-source methods. In FY17, this PE successfully tested several frameworks, including a smartphone-based system with Defense Language students and a table-based e-book capability with Special Operators. In FY18, this program plans to work with other agencies to transition some of these capabilities into operational use, coordinate with professional specifications and standards bodies to author relevant technical guidelines, and to continue development of these emerging capabilities. 

Interagency and Interorganizational Coordination – In FY17, this program provided distributed learning modernization support to more than 40 defense agencies (e.g., The Army Distributed Learning Program, Naval Education and Training Command, Air Education and Training Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command, Joint Knowledge Online, Defense Acquisition University), more than 15 international partners (e.g., NATO, The Technical Cooperation Program, Partnership for Peace Consortium), and other federal agencies (e.g., National Park Service, Customs and Border Protection). In FY18, this program will continue to coordinate with these stakeholders and with relevant working groups, such as the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The primary objectives of this PE are to inform distributed learning modernization efforts, to develop associated policy and guidance documents, and to coordinate across distributed learning agencies to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government. 

MODERNIZATION: The modernization work consists of a collection of smaller technical efforts, each with project metrics that reflect their unique technical goals. Typical metrics include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged by other defense and federal agencies, the increase in the number of interoperable training and education digital systems, the impact of these efforts on defense/federal strategic planning, and downstream reductions in training and education portfolio costs. 

DOCUMENTATION: For the policy and documentation efforts, metrics include at-least annual update of published guidance, ensuring the documentation adheres to current technical/industry standards. The policy and documentation utility is also judged based upon its use, including both number of vendors adopting the policy and number of defense/federal acquisition efforts adhering to the guidance.

COORDINATION: For the interagency and interorganizational coordination efforts, performance is first measured based upon the number of agencies, international organizations, and professional groups directly supported. Success is measured based upon the number of requirements consolidated across defense and federal stakeholders, an increase in partnering between agencies for distributed learning resource sharing, and, ultimately, in improved return on investment for distributed learning efforts.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  Reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has increased (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the January 2017 Defense Science Board Report, “Defense Research Enterprise Assessment,” software, autonomy, and cyber are today’s core challenges.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to ensure a competitive advantage.  

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD’s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management. 

The SEI Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I), Autonomy, Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts experiments designed to develop capabilities in anticipation of emerging adversary threats, while addressing immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  QRSP efforts support the Department’s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by leveraging commercial technologies and acting as an incubator for potentially game-changing capabilities.  This Program Element also supports the Department of Defense’s (DoD) strategy to address future threats in a more competitive environment with resurgence of near-peer competitors and adversaries who have studied and worked to counter U.S. technological capabilities.  QRSP provides an agile mechanism to affordably counter emerging technological threats, inform the requirements process, and help maintain DoD’s technical superiority, while fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  Funding in this Program Element enables the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) to anticipate and respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman’s Gap Assessment, USD(R&amp;E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).    

The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell support.  Focus areas within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; target identification and tracking; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; technical risk assessments through wargaming; and, autonomous systems.

The QRF objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies and accelerate these capabilities to the warfighter.  The QRF program initiates prototyping projects during the execution year to mature technologies critically needed for the CCMDs.  QRF focus areas include anti-access and area denial, broad electronic warfare, and autonomous learning systems for processing and analyzing intelligence streams.  
 
The RRF objectives are to develop proof-of-concept prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies, and expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative and affordable concepts and technologies that meet time-sensitive operational needs as identified by CCMDs, military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as advanced algorithms and software intelligence, to enable conceptual prototyping with agile technology insertion.  The program also leverages existing capabilities in our traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      

The JRAC focus is on responding, in timeframes acceptable to the CCMDs, to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that are submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  To meet these objectives, JRAC leverages contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.

The SMA Cell's objective is to support CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  SMA products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) provides the Services, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on relatively mature technologies to rapidly develop and field-test promising new conceptual prototypes that can have immediate impact on time-sensitive operational needs.  QRF focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs.  QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.

In FY 2018 and FY 2019, QRF will continue to identify and fund prototypes and technology demonstrations that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Investments respond to Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities, including the following interest areas: counter anti-access and area denial; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; novel human identification technologies; human-machine collaborative decision making; and, counter-electronic warfare technologies. 

Recent success stories and significant transitions of note include:
•  Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech: This project successfully developed a speech triage capability to determine if and when there is speech in a captured radio frequency signal.  Once speech has been detected, the prototype can identify speakers, languages, and keywords in real time across multiple channels.  In 2017, this project transitioned to the Naval Air Systems Command Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office (PMA-290) for deployment and follow-on integration on Navy signals intelligence platforms.   
•  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization: This project developed new Link 16 improvements for increased anti-jam communication performance.  The project also designed a real-time processor that fits into existing radio circuit card slots to increase adoption of the new technology.  Details of this project are classified.  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization transitioned to the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) radio program for integration into the Link 16 baseline system.
•  CyberPhantom: This project developed fully customizable cyber tools for open network exploitation.  The solution leveraged best practices of the cyber workforce and expanded cyber space capabilities with a unique blend of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software integrated with new customized tools.  Details are classified.  In January of 2017, CyberPhantom transitioned to a classified operation user.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These HW/SW Assurance projects directly support all elements in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 937.  This program established the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) that federates hardware and software assurance expertise and capabilities throughout DoD and makes the capabilities directly available to programs.  

The JFAC provides tools, services, best practices, contract language, and other help to programs that detect, assess, prioritize, and mitigate mission critical vulnerabilities to malicious software attacks and supply chain exploitation vulnerabilities.  The collaboration helps mitigate existing and emerging critical threats and vulnerabilities in both SW and HW and yields secure architecture and design patterns available to all DoD programs.  Trusted and Assured Microelectronics Program Elements 0604294D8Z BA4 and 0605294D8Z BA5 demonstrate these capabilities and augment the hardware assurance capabilities of the JFAC.</r2:Description>

Patton developed enhanced I&amp;W visualization tools for the warfighter, addressing shortfalls in the ability to provide accurate and timely I&amp;W to Combatant Commands (CCMD).  Patton uses a holistic approach to identify critical threat precursors as highlighted by warfighters.  In addition, a team of analysts developed a baseline of data feeds that integrated with a set of enhanced visualization tools to help communicate I&amp;W.  As a result, operators have the information required to analyze adversary threat behaviors.  In FY 2017, the project developed, demonstrated, and transitioned the visualization tools to CCMD customers.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High-throughput DNA Sequencing (HTS) Technology Focus Area will leverage technological advances in gene sequencing and bioinformatics to fundamentally change the way DNA is used to support military operations.  These projects will employ current hardware coupled with custom chemistries, data analysis algorithms, databases, and information transmission pipelines to enable more comprehensive analysis of trace, degraded, and mixed DNA samples.  This comprehensive data analysis allows for correlating individual activities and histories; the ability to determine biogeographical ancestry; increasing confidence in assigning extended kinship identifications; and, greater accuracy in predicting phenotypic attributes such as facial characteristics, eye colors, or skin tones and variations.  This focus area also includes support for HTS databases that are designed to ingest large DNA data flows efficiently, use processing power for searching and analyzing big data, and employ big data analytics to make predictive assessments that would otherwise go unnoticed.  This focus area will encourage collaboration on biometrics and forensics projects within the DoD, and with interagency, industry, academia, and international partners where applicable.  This collaboration will help maximize shared investment and prevent redundant research.  Deliverables are shared throughout the biometrics and forensics communities.</r2:Description>

Face identification at a distance creates challenges that can only be addressed through improvements in technology including optics, video processing, and facial recognition algorithms.  Investments will address challenges associated with image resolution, stabilization, and atmospheric turbulence, as well as other factors associated with collecting images from non-cooperative individuals.  Associated technologies include rapid matching algorithms, storage of large facial databases, and secure dissemination within the DoD and our partners.  This project will leverage existing efforts and ensure projects are not duplicative with ongoing facial identification work within the DoD or with outside agencies.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) project accelerates the development and transition of high-potential science and technology (S&amp;T) projects through operationally useful conceptual prototypes.  It achieves this by anticipating adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responding to new threats and opportunities.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and increase ‘speed to market’ by providing cost effective capabilities faster than typical acquisition cycles.

In prior years, RRF supported the development of alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing innovative technologies.   

In FY 2018 and FY 2019, RRF will continue to provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and developing near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  RRF projects support goals from the new Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering).  The RRF’s current focus areas include: open source data analysis; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization; prototypes for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; additive manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; maritime technologies; and, novel applications of repurposed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) technologies.  Typical RRF projects address these focus areas through a conceptual prototype within 6 to 18 months and for less than $1.000 million.  

Recent success stories and significant transitions of note include:
•  Advanced File Carver: This project developed a completely new tool that allows the rapid extraction and recovery of files from large data stores such as hard drives.  The Advanced File Carver significantly increased the functionality available to users over comparable GOTS/COTS competitors while simultaneously increasing performance speed ten-fold.  Additionally, this tool provides capabilities previously unavailable, including the reconstruction of partially overwritten files, and the recovery of digital images whose headers were deleted.  As a GOTS solution, the Department of Defense (DoD) has made this technology available across the Department and to over 15 federal agencies.
•  Ingres Tactical WiFi: The airborne Ingres system uses active WiFi signals and advanced processing algorithms to provide an accurate geolocation of target devices in dense, electromagnetically congested, urban environments.  Ingres can identify WiFi transmitters, such as a target's phone or laptop, with better than ten meter accuracy from standoff distances.  Ingres is transitioning to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command to perform evaluations in operationally relevant environments.   
•  Aluminum Start System: This project developed an electric plasma start system for aluminum combustors to replace the standard hydrogen-oxygen pilot-flame ignition system.  Aluminum combustors are an effective alternative to fossil fuel engines that can use sea water instead of air for oxidizer; however, current systems require pressurized hydrogen and oxygen to initiate combustion.  The prototype microwave-powered steam-plasma torch eliminates hydrogen-oxygen start systems and their associated risk.  This effort transitioned to the U.S. Navy for follow-on development and integration into the aluminum combustion power system for large displacement unmanned underwater vehicles.
•  Bloom: Responding to an emerging operational need, Project Bloom developed a moored buoy capable of long duration surface measurement operations.  The system provides a platform for radio frequency (RF), magnetic, optical, radiological, and chemical sensing on a standardized and easy to deploy buoy.  The Bloom buoy includes an internal winch capable of submerging it for "sleep" periods and to avoid approaching craft.  The operational prototype was deployed to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility and transitioned.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The SMA reach-back cell was established by the Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO) at the request of the Commander, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM).  SMA efforts leverage multi-agency, multi-disciplinary approaches to address requirements that are not within the customer organization’s core competency.  SMA assessments are framed during the year of execution and are in response to specific tasking from senior leadership in the CCMDs.  The SMA Cell identifies options from across the U.S. Government, academia, and the private sector.  SMA efforts are facilitated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff/J-3 Operations and are executed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering.  The SMA Cell provides USCENTCOM with population-based and regional expertise in support of ongoing operations in the Iraq/Syria region.</r2:Description>

The first capability will be a handheld, rapid, automatic explosive detector called ExploDisk.  This device will not only check for the presence of seven common explosives, its novel use of cellphone camera technology will mitigate human error in color determination; a common weakness with current technologies.  This capability can also support the identification of illegal drugs by using different disposable analysis ‘chips’.  The second capability is a novel DNA analysis protocol that will extend kinship analysis from the current limit of second generation (grandparents or siblings) to the fourth generation (great-great grandparents or cousins).  This capability is critical to support the identification of remains lost from World War II and Korea as their direct relations may die before the service members’ remains are located.  The final effort leverages FY 2016 funds to finish development and deliver an advanced file carving system.  This system will accelerate the extraction and categorization of files of interest from large data stores while simultaneously screening out useless junk files.  Depending on the file types, this carver will accelerate the process 25 percent to 80 percent over prior carving systems.</r2:Text>

Current systems are comprised of bulky hardware and DNA analysis times greater than 60 minutes.  The FaSTR DNA instrument exploits centrifugally-driven microfluidics to eliminate mechanical valves and pressure-driven flow, and allows commercial-off-the-shelf electronics to facilitate sample preparation, polymerase chain reaction, and assessment.  This paradigm shift to microfluidic technology radically reduces the form factor, analysis time, and cost of the system.  The FaSTR project will produce the first truly portable, rapid DNA analysis instrument capable of generating DNA profiles from “sample in” to “answer out” in less than 30 minutes and provide a match probability of 1 in 55 billion people.</r2:Description>

The overall goal of these projects is to reduce future operational risk to warfighters.  New technologies demonstrated through this program will allow warfighters to identify bad actors or counter adversaries’ attempts to mitigate our technologies.  These projects leverage techniques such as conceptual prototyping, increased use of small businesses, and increased competition between vendors.  Biometrics and forensics projects will mature emerging technologies that support identity operations and forensic capabilities required by commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military activities.

                                                    <r2:Description>ISR sensors are critical for providing asymmetric compensation against larger, near-peer adversaries.  However, ISR systems span a wide range of sensing modalities and generally produce very large data sets that are difficult to analyze.  Efforts in this focus area will increase speed to market for better sensors and tools to more effectively analyze or visualize ISR data.  Projects include improved surveillance sensors; tools to facilitate analysis of large data sets; methods to harvest meaningful intelligence from open and classified sources; and, establishment of more effective processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities.  RRF sponsored prototypes will facilitate integration of advanced ISR capabilities into new and existing systems.  These prototypes will help increase the effectiveness of ISR architectures and reduce the human analyst requirement to produce actionable intelligence.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area will develop the enabling capabilities and key technologies required to advance and secure additive manufacturing technology to meet specific warfighter needs.  Additive manufacturing projects are those that use processes in which successive layers of material are laid down under computer control to create functional three dimensional products.  Additive manufacturing allows for rapid prototyping and iterative innovation, removing barriers for technology insertion.  Due to increased speed from design to prototype, reduced cost, and reduced waste, additive manufacturing provides a unique supporting capability for maintaining a U.S. competitive advantage.  This focus area will leverage swiftly-developing commercial innovation and emerging capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia to develop conceptual prototypes focused on warfighter needs.  Projects include spare part replacement, jet engine repair, custom hardware enclosures, and three-dimensional (3-D) models.  Projects have the potential to significantly improve supply chain efficiencies by storing parts as software and manufacturing on demand, and by using rapid prototyping to reduce the time and cost of design.  Projects can also reduce amount of labor required to produce functioning prototypes.  Projects will also investigate security of additive manufacturing technologies and digital schematics.  Deliverables will inform enhancement decisions and concept of operations development.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This effort increases impact and responsiveness of prototyping efforts through the reuse and repurposing of existing commercial and governmental technologies.  Frequently, systems developed for a separate application provide a partial solution to new emerging challenges.  By building new prototypes around a core of proven technologies, this effort reduces development and adoption risk in addition to controlling cost.  This focus area provides RRF with agility by leveraging existing technologies to develop new prototypes and demonstrations.</r2:Description>

With input from across the U.S. Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to CCMD-generated challenging problems and informs the command's senior leadership.  Each SMA effort is initiated at the request of senior CCMD leadership and priorities for SMA problems are set by the Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision making process of CCMD's senior leaders.  SMA is also supported by the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The SMA Cell started a strategic analysis effort at the request of the United States Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  The effort evaluated strategic risks and identified knowledge gaps to provide an increased understanding of potential security environments and their implications for Palestinian security sector reform.  USEUCOM subsequently asked SMA to apply the same methodology to identify emerging Russian threats and opportunities in Eurasia.  Building on these efforts, USSOCOM requested that the SMA cell assess how the U.S. Government can diagnose, identify, and assess indirect strategies, and develop response options against associated types of Gray Zone challenges.  SMA completed several actor and social media analyses including Virtual Think Tank Assessments (ViTTa) that provided summarized subject matter expert (SME) analyses to USSOCOM.  The assessing ‘Gray Zone’ support to USSOCOM concluded in FY 2017.</r2:Description>

The cell will continue to actively collaborate with CCMD senior leadership and the Joint Staff leadership to identify challenging problems that are not within the traditional areas of DoD expertise.  These problems will help increase our understanding of ‘Gray Zone’ conflicts and identify potential responses.  USSOCOM is leveraging these efforts to support a senior leader forum on ‘Gray Zone’ indications and warnings and USEUCOM has established a Russian deterrence effort that benefits from SMA’s work.  Additional products will directly support other CCMDs and government agencies.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses Defense Research and Engineering priorities to advance engineering state of the practice, and complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), systems engineering (SE) research, and engineering capabilities for resilience, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems in support of the full range and scope of Department of Defense (DoD) missions and operations.

M&amp;S is a key enabler of DoD capabilities; underpins innovative solutions meeting real-world national security challenges and ensuring technical superiority; acts as a force multiplier; saves resources; and saves lives.  The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&amp;S, enhances the DoD M&amp;S Enterprise by (1) enabling joint and cross-cutting cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&amp;S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&amp;S.

The Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department’s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of 23 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems.

Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for achieving more affordable and mission-resilient warfighting systems designed within a shorter time frame by conducting research and development and new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, modeling capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.  These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that enables advanced knowledge management and multi-community collaboration, including data retention and lessons learned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) improves design agility and cost-effectiveness during analysis and development leading to improvements in testing, manufacturing, and fielding of mission-effective and adaptable systems. Its products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks that will integrate physics-based models and engineering tools across acquisition disciplines to vastly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, iteratively optimize designs and improve architectures to reduce or eliminate sensitivity to adversary tactics and capability improvements, and adapt those designs over time. The goal is to provide new pathways to acquisition and achieve a vitally-needed transformation in the contribution of Defense systems engineering to design resilience and effectiveness across the systems lifecycle. These engineering improvements are essential to accelerate capability to the warfighter and address a geopolitical environment marked by rapidly changing threats, tactics, missions and technologies, and fiscal constraints. The pace of change renders current point-design approaches unsustainable in both cost and time.

ERS research and development focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.   These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports transparency, inclusion and data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration.  ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&amp;T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased/easier utilization of High Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability. ERS provides the capability to fully explore and identify key performance parameters and inform the requirements process.  With ERS, DoD is buying down the risk of future systems by using high-fidelity modeling and advanced analyses of design options, as well as linking candidate platforms to traditional modeling and simulation toolkits and employing DoD’s high-performance computing assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds HEL advanced technology development aimed at translating technology solutions for broadly defined military problems into demonstrated performance pay-offs, increased capabilities, increased supportability, and/or increased affordability.  HEL weapons systems have many potential advantages, including speed-of-light time-to-target, high precision, nearly unlimited magazine depth, low cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements because of no need for stocks of munitions or warheads.  As a result, HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions.  Activities conducted under this program element will develop and demonstrate the technology necessary to enable HEL missions across the Department of Defense (DoD).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to keep pace with evolving weapons technologies.  This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion. The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other Government agencies, and industry to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  The program outreaches and engages academia to address test technology challenges in DoD testing, advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other minority serving institutions.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program aligns with the S&amp;T Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&amp;T investments.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  
  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation, and modeling and simulation capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost-glide weapons. HSST continued progress toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope. Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number (M4.5-7.5) aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that the component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The HAPCAT project continued to develop and demonstrate air delivery system (ADS) technologies to provide uniform flow with variable pressure and temperature through a nozzle up to Mach 7.5 conditions.  The project activities included the design and initial fabrication of the ADS and conceptual design of a full scale facility. 
  Efforts continued on the morphing ceramic nozzle for hypersonic ground test facilities project which seeks to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  Following validation testing conducted at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), efforts were made to begin the refurbishment of the nozzle for implementation into the HAPCAT facility.  
  Construction of the Large Energy National Shock (LENS) Tunnel II extension was completed and evaluated to verify extended run times. Such testing will enable the full development of complex flow features affecting vehicle performance, the determination of control surface responsiveness and effectiveness, and the evaluation of the performance of aerodynamic features. The improvements will help fill a critical test capability gap and support future hypersonic vehicle programs. Initial facility performance assessments of the extended tunnel demonstrated a three-fold increase in test run time.  The facility was successfully used by multiple customers who required the expanded capabilities in order to meet their test objectives.
  The HSST project continued development of a mid-pressure arc heater prototype.  The prototype replaced an existing Huels arc heater with a segmented heater, creating a test envelope approximately three times larger than the current envelope for aerothermal testing.  Validations runs were successfully completed confirming extended test run times of up to 30 minutes and a higher thermal load representative of that experienced by a hypersonic vehicle TPS. These efforts advanced progress toward the goal of improved T&amp;E of maneuvering reentry and boost/glide vehicles. In a related effort, the arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development progressed toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.   The effort investigated two different spin-coil designs, one of which was validated for use in the mid-pressure arc heater facility.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  
  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance. Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle. Experimental results acquired through the boundary layer transition effort will be used to validate state of the art prediction tools and measurements of boundary layer transition mechanisms.
  Facility flow field characterizations were conducted at the Purdue quiet tunnel and the LENS facilities at CUBRC, enabling more effective comparisons between all the facilities and informing test customers of intrinsic flow features in each facility. The characterizations will also provide insight to boundary layer transition studies in these facilities. The project also conducted testing of a boost-glide vehicle, resulting in critical findings to support future flight tests of the vehicle.   
  HSST completed development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed/direction, oxygen/water content) along a hypersonic vehicle’s flight path.  This technology is a significant advancement over current methods, which employ balloons carrying sensors to sample the atmosphere.  The LIDAR will improve the accuracy of characterizing high altitude atmospheric conditions. This atmospheric data is needed to assess the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development. Testing and demonstration of LIDAR atmospheric sensing was completed and the portable system was transitioned to support test programs at coastal flight test ranges to demonstrate system performance in a maritime environment. Development of an airborne version of the LIDAR continued with the design and testing of hardware components for the in-flight demonstration of the system on a crewed aircraft in preparation for implementation on an uncrewed vehicle. 
  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  The final design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft. 
  The fabrication, and installation of a telemetry capability integrated with a High Altitude, Long Endurance Uncrewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) for a technical demonstration continued in preparation for support of flight testing.
  Measurements of thermal emissions from the surface of typical boost-glide vehicles in an impulse test facility were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different surface compositions and treatments and filter frequencies for thermal imaging. The completion of this project resulted in valuable insights gained for a boost-glide vehicle design; these insights will be useful for future testing in high-enthalpy (high-energy) facilities.   
  Advances were achieved in the development of M&amp;S tools. Verification and improvement of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes continued, making use of the unique data sets obtained from HSST scramjet engine tests and boundary layer experiments.   A technical report was generated that summarizes the methodology for conducting boundary layer stability computations in support of acquisition programs, including shortfalls in current capabilities and recommended improvements for the toolsets available. This report was released to the hypersonic community and serves as a benchmark document for use in hypersonic programs.
  The HSST transient thermal analysis software effort transitioned to users in the hypersonic community to support ground testing and flight testing.  
  A force measurement system technology development completed for use in short-duration, high-enthalpy test facilities. Such technology will permit testing that elucidates real gas effects on hypersonic vehicles.</r2:Description>

Efforts will include demonstration of new flight test techniques, improvements in instrumentation, and continued improvement and validation of CFD codes.
  Progress will continue toward integration and operation of the HAPCAT clean-air, variable Mach number testbed, including the design, fabrication, testing and installation of the air delivery system components. The air delivery system will combine three separate streams of pressurized air, each at different temperatures and pressures, and deliver them to the hypersonic nozzle of the HAPCAT facility.  The air streams are regulated through the air delivery system to produce a specified flight enthalpy (energy) level appropriate for the clean air flight condition being simulated in the test.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems as well as between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&amp;E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including the potential for a large increase in available bandwidth, but the C-Band spectrum comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band and the band is heavily shared for alternate uses.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size, weight and power) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  The DoD strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The SET project performed risk reduction on a networked data recorder and data transmission scheme in support of Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) networked telemetry projects.  The networked data recorder addresses CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  The data transmission scheme is designed to minimize the amount and type of data transmitted over the telemetry network, reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed during a test event. This technology enables more efficient use of the RF spectrum by reducing the amount of data transmitted by only transmitting data parameters when changes occur.  
  A non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne applications was demonstrated showing 10 gigabit Ethernet data speeds required to support CTEIP data transmission requirements. Once ruggedized, this technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard test data transmitter. SET matured technology to enable more efficient handling of multiple priority test data and communications between the network router and telemetry transceiver.  Development continued on a multi-band transceiver operating in the L/S/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms.  This technology determines the performance of the telemetry link and selects the optimal modulation scheme based on current link conditions, accounting for issues such as multipath.  Technology enabling the compression of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) data was further matured. 
  The SET project developed technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of large footprint, long range missiles and hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna suitable for mounting on a Global Hawk platform was developed and its antenna gain performance characterized in a high fidelity laboratory environment.  A modular digital beam-forming solution to control a phased array antenna and track multiple targets simultaneously was matured.  These technologies will significantly reduce the system complexity for an airborne phased array antenna, providing savings in terms of size, weight, and power consumption.    
  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a software-based technology solution to accurately characterize RF spectrum utilization on DoD test ranges. This technology will develop the interfaces to existing range RF spectrum scheduling and resource management tools and also implement a standard set of spectrum usage metrics to quantify RF spectrum usage based on times of day and test programs. This tool will transition initially to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB to support RF spectrum management activities, aid in the identification of future spectrum requirements, and quantify the impact of inadequate access to spectrum, in terms of program cost and schedule.</r2:Description>

This antenna technology will employ either mechanical or digital methods to point the telemetry link to a specific ground receive antenna. The pointing of the telemetry link will enable spectrum reuse through spatial diversity, enabling two test platforms to transmit test data within the same portion of RF spectrum.  The SET project will initiate development of radio technology that can utilize alternate spectrum in the upper frequency bands.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to establish dominance in the modern battlespace, our offensive and defensive electronic warfare systems must be capable against advanced radio frequency (RF) directed threats and electro-optic (EO) guided threats, which include infrared (IR) guidance.  Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&amp;E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. 
  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&amp;E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.  
  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Major thrusts included continuing efforts in advanced sensors, TSPI instrumentation, warfighter physical and cognitive assessment under various workloads and mitigation of test range encroachments.  
  The AIST project completed development of advanced waveforms to mitigate wind turbine effects on DoD test ranges.  Development continued on a passive imaging technology to derive size, shape, mass, drag coefficients, velocity and vectors for individual fragments to quickly characterize the fragment characteristics and distribution in warhead testing.  
  Work completed on classifiers to identify specific sea mammals (e.g., various dolphin and whale species) found at undersea ranges and the automated processing and display of mammal detections.  The AIST project continued the development of: a system to measure and assess warfighter cognitive performance under realistic conditions during a T&amp;E event; a personnel tracking system using amplitude modulation (AM) band signals; and technology to evaluate back face deformation of body armor from a blunt trauma event.
  Work completed on a technology for in-water vehicles to recognize their position relative to another in-water platform in real time.  This will improve safety during tests and allow for more controlled two-body T&amp;E events involving conventional sea platforms as well as autonomous underwater vehicles.  This technology transitioned to the U.S. Navy.
  The AIST project initiated an effort to develop a high fidelity model which takes into account the noisier acoustic properties of shallow water environments (120 feet to 900 feet) for littoral T&amp;E.  The model will support evaluation of undersea test range technologies (e.g., hydrophone arrays, new communication signals/modulations, transducers, and portable instrumentation.</r2:Description>

Sensing applications will include weapon system orientation, body armor blunt trauma evaluation, air launched stores separation, and weapon angle of incidence measurement at impact.  Advanced data transformation initiatives will develop technologies for adaptive computing, virtual/synthetic instrumentation, data compression, wireless on-board data transport and improved data storage density.  Other areas of investigation will include micro-miniaturization of electronic components for non-intrusive applications.  AIST will continue to investigate technologies for mitigating range environmental encroachment issues such as alternative energy interference with range tracking systems.  Additional efforts will include human performance measurement and assessment, specifically human interaction with unmanned systems and the evaluation of the interaction of the warfighter and weapons/equipment and interactions between individual warfighters in team-based holistic assessments.
  The AIST project will complete technologies to measure: fragment characteristics from warhead testing; TSPI using distinctive near-field patterns from AM signals; and mental effort of warfighters during test events.   AIST will demonstrate a capability for in-water vehicles to recognize their position relative to another in-water platform in real time.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects. The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Likewise, C4T is developing technologies to analyze the increasing mass of structured and unstructured data generated by C4I and SIS testing.  The technologies are required when testing sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide the accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking, and situational awareness) as the data passes among the Services and coalition participants.  
  The technologies within C4T will remove undesired distributed testing biases while improving test agility and the tester’s ability to effectively conduct rapid analysis of “Big Data” and automated test reporting.  C4T advances test automation features (test planning, test execution, Big Data collection, analysis, and visualization) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) along with hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL)laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and command and control systems accessing and providing information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The C4T project completed development of technologies to enable the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) to utilize remote methods of authentication and privilege management to distributed users.  Moreover, these technologies will support the use of TENA over a broad range of networks and provide a common interoperability test architecture.   C4T continued development of technologies in multiple areas of “Big Data” rapid analytics by focusing on facilitating Data-to-Decisions (D2D). These technologies contribute to knowledge management and analytics in support of near-real time semantic analysis of large structured and unstructured datasets and assist the analyst in making decisions during test events. These technologies are targeted for support of F-35 testing. 
  C4T continued to develop real-time automated multi-band infrared target segmentation technology using state-of-the-art neural network and deep learning based algorithms.
  Development continued on technologies to test MK-48 and MK-54 torpedoes.  These technologies will provide an acoustic propagation model, both narrow and broad band, of sufficient fidelity to test torpedo performance in various maritime tactical environments.  The model includes a real-time simulation/emulation system for testing torpedo sonar systems in multiple bathometry, biological and threat environments.  The model will incorporate autonomous evasion maneuvers of targeted submarines or surface ships. 
  The C4T project continued the development of technologies to provide a reliable, fast, and cost-effective approach that enables Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) testing of next generation weapon systems.  These technologies will enable live assets to sense and respond to stimulus without regard to whether the stimulus is real or synthetic.
  The C4T project initiated the development of technologies to optimize the deployment of test support networks, plan expeditionary tests, manage bandwidth and spectrum contention with a networked system under test, and provide Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) data during live tests. These technologies will address deficiencies in Operational Test (OT) for network-enabled technology.</r2:Description>

The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology developments within the UAST portfolio have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess an autonomous system’s ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating, system-of-autonomous-systems that will work in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>New efforts focused on test technologies supporting the near term challenges identified in the 2013–2038 DoD Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, such as, integrating DoD unmanned systems within the National Airspace and safely operating unmanned aerial systems within the Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB). UAST collaborated with the Autonomy Community of Interest (COI) Test and Evaluation, Verification and Validation Working Group to ensure that UAST is investing in technologies relevant to the future of autonomous systems.
  The UAST project explored technologies required for T&amp;E of emerging UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces. The UAST project emphasized autonomy test technologies that can be integrated for use in a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) environment within the MRTFB.  UAST continued investments in robustness testing technology to detect and predict vulnerabilities and failures within UAS software.  UAST continued developments to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies will also prevent the test vehicle from violating flight envelopes, range boundaries, and warning areas. UAST initiated an effort to develop a software tool that will enable testers to monitor the internal autonomous processing states of a system under test without interfering with its operations or requiring modification to the system’s software or hardware.  UAST initiated efforts to produce a comprehensive and actionable Strategic Autonomy T&amp;E Investment Plan by assessing autonomy test infrastructure gaps, and evaluating test technology maturity required to cover gaps.</r2:Description>

Advancements in utilizing cyberspace are outpacing the technologies needed for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project develops advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&amp;E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will require advancement and maturation of nascent test technologies.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic mission of this program element is to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense’s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&amp;T) investments.  It contains the two projects described below:

P455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes S&amp;T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.

P456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM), co-sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment (ASD(EIE)), develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power/energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, (2) increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (3) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services and will be used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Text>The Joint Operational Command and Control effort demonstrated the ability to pass operational energy information around the battlefield.  Initial results show the ability to manually capture some limited operational energy information and provided it to decision makers within 24 hours of data capture.  The team conducted a design update for the Asset Wireless Network (AWN) Common Communications Module, installed firmware updates and executed a contract with Penn State University for AWN support

Operational Energy Watson was able to demonstrate a minimum viable product centered on AF S&amp;T investment in Hypersonics and specifically in high-temperature materials.  OE Watson is developing a cognitive assistant that combines deep learning, quantitative analysis, and analytic wargames. Funding also allowed for adoption of a single knowledge management tool(SEMS2.0) re-purposing from SERDP/ESTCP to OECIF.  The tool has been adapted for OECIF and the FY18 call of proposals and selection is utilizing this new capability.

Space Solar Power team held the program kickoff, discussed the application for potential users, and defined metrics of success.  Initial focus is on current solar cell technology with additional investment in perovskites.

The Ultra High Density Hybrid Energy Storage Module effort (HD HESM) is a follow-on from P456.  The team initiated contracting through the Air Force Research Lab for a new High Density System, developed cross service System Requirements (Navy, Army and AF), and initiated platform analysis for HD HESM installation and operation.

OECIF continues to co-sponsor, with SERDP/ESTCP, emerging Waste-to-Energy Technology development.</r2:Text>

The analytical methods programs, which began in FY14, will continue.  The STORM-E effort will advance the EF 21 scenario development and analysis capabilities, identify energy-based risk to operations, examine mitigation solutions, and shape plans and programs.  OEATF will complete the FCPM V&amp;V; complete analysis of the second of three scenarios; complete scenario enhancements for the third of three scenarios; develop an IWARS technical report addressing OE; and represent aerial resupply capability within SoSAT.  J-DEPLOI plans to continue adaptation and development of Group W's fuel planning tool, continue executing the plan for integration with MBPS, and begin verification and testing of the tool's first incremental capabilities.  MEAM plans to assess future force structure and logistics force implications, investigate incorporating Joint and Coalition operations, define warfighting operational effectiveness tactical decision aid requirements, and develop a production plan for resulting tools and methods.  CAMEL will continue analyzing concepts of operations associated with adaptive basing strategies within A2AD environments and the impact to operational energy within airlift and aerial refueling missions; explore overall costs associated with flex basing; and continue enhancements to the modeling, simulation and analysis tool set.

The FY15 vehicles program will continue.  The Thermally Efficient Cylinders program will conduct single-cylinder engine testing with the first generation coating; the coating and piston optimization will be based on feedback from testing and modeling.  The TVEK project will complete CAT 15 HEMTT A4 engine fuel map testing, test the baseline HEMTT vehicle's auxiliary systems, complete Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) of auxiliary systems for TVEK electrified component selections, develop M&amp;S controls and software for the TVEK supervisory control system, initiate procurement of optimized TVEK components for testing in a system integration lab (SIL) at TARDEC, and conduct System Functional Review and Preliminary Design Review as part of the system engineering process.  The Automation/Smart Cruise Control program will enter Phase II and conduct convoy vehicle simulations.  The M&amp;S for Vehicle Light-Weighting program will repeat the weight optimization process with various other target components and compare the updated optimized system model with the baseline model.

The programs begun in FY16 will continue to ramp up during this fiscal year.  The Reliable, Efficient, Tactical UAS Power System program will build the Great Horned Owl engine, which will lead to a runnable second generation engine.  The Hybrid Tiger team will complete vehicle detailed analysis and purchase new wing tooling to build an integrated solar wing, combine software from multiple organizations, and complete end-to-end bench testing in preparation for maiden flight.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This project funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record – which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear forensics is the thorough collection, analysis and evaluation of radiological and nuclear material in a pre-detonation state and post-detonation radiological or nuclear materials, devices and debris, as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation.  The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.

Nuclear terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based prompt diagnostic systems and airborne sample collection systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of nuclear forensics. 

Per DoDD 2060.04 OSD AT&amp;L NCB provides guidance and direction for the implementation of the Department of Defense National Technical Nuclear Forensics program.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but emphasizes post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post-detonation nuclear forensics capability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) demonstrates and validates promising and innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.  Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) demonstrates and validates promising and innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.   Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This initiative responds to Congressional direction for the Department to increase energy efficiency, reduce installation energy intensity, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve energy security. Emerging energy technologies offer DoD a cost effective opportunity to meet these requirements on its installations while reducing energy and operational costs. The DoD test bed program validates and tests the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment. The test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to evaluate energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test bed's key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC), the Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element develops, demonstrates and validates cost-effective technologies for use in humanitarian demining via operational field evaluations in support of Geographical Combatant Commands (GCC) Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) goals and objectives.  

The HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the GCCs and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to craft a research and development plan that supports GCC HMA program plans and strategic objectives and enhances mil-to-mil partnerships in key regional states and provides access to live mines/UXO around the world for operational test data collection unavailable to any other DoD organization.  The HD R&amp;D Program accomplishes the GCC support by utilizing host nation demining partners to evaluate technology in actual minefields to simultaneously achieve HMA objectives and identify performance parameters; data is delivered to the US military countermine R&amp;D programs to inform future investment decisions.  In addition to the improvements made to technologies used by U.S. forces and to the reduction of landmine and UXO threat to US forces and host nation population, the Program’s technology trainings and evaluations build mine action capacity and capability within mine-affected countries and improve safety, stability and economic development. 

Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 202 evaluations in 39 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Zimbabwe.  The program’s technologies have cleared 46.7 million square meters of the world’s toughest minefields; and found or destroyed 186,000 mines and UXO.

New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop and a biennial UXO Working Group Meeting held by OASD SO/LIC.  The meetings involve representatives from Department of State (DOS), GCC Humanitarian Mine Action offices, mine action organizations and mine-affected nations.  The program element’s work fulfills the Department of Defense’s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with § 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) supports DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission. Coalition warfare and multinational operations are fundamental features of the U.S. National Security Strategy. Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. Coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.

CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  In its seventeen-year history, CWP has leveraged $3 of foreign partner funding from 75 foreign partners and $2 of other U.S. Government funding for every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects. CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD is currently estimated at approximately $19 billion per year (down from approximately $22 billion in Fiscal Year 2007). The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as collaboration between universities, Armed Forces Academies and DoD laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development and producing individuals with corrosion expertise for the DoD corrosion control community of the future.  Research areas include performance prediction, assessment of finish, surface engineering, and product support.  This advanced corrosion research has been ongoing since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.

In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.

These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense systems and infrastructure.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs and improve the availability and safety of weapon systems and facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  A total of 151 projects have been completed to date and 111 have resulted in new technology implementation.  The overall return on investment as estimated by the Military Departments is 16:1.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD is currently estimated at approximately $19 billion per year (down from approximately $22 billion in Fiscal Year 2007). The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as collaboration between universities, Armed Forces Academies and DoD laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development and producing individuals with corrosion expertise for the DoD corrosion control community of the future.  Research areas include performance prediction, assessment of finish, surface engineering, and product support.  This advanced corrosion research has been ongoing since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.

In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.

These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense systems and infrastructure.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs and improve the availability and safety of weapon systems and facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  A total of 151 projects have been completed to date and 111 have resulted in new technology implementation.  The overall return on investment as estimated by the Military Departments is 16:1.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisitions are accomplished in three categories including projects, research opportunities, and activities as described in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.

Projects are funded jointly by CPO and the Military Departments and are led by subject matter experts at the Military Department laboratories.  CPO issues a call for proposed project plans in April and projects are submitted in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  CPO receives project plans and convenes an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, joint service applicability, and probability of transition.  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects, funding is distributed to the Military Departments by Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.  Project execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Research opportunities are funded through the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC).  A call for white paper proposals is issued by CPO through an existing U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Submissions are evaluated by a technical panel chaired by the Deputy Director, CPO.  Evaluation factors include quality of proposed research, potential impact on DoD corrosion problems, level of student involvement, and proposed collaboration between the research institutions and DoD laboratories.  Projects are ranked by the selection panel and funded based on merit and available funds.  Research institutions receive funds for the TCC through the establishment of cooperative agreements with USAFA.  Research execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Activities are those work efforts associated with the Working Integrated Product Teams (WIPT) under the CPCIPT and include policy, training, specifications and standards, metrics, science and technology, facilities, and communication and outreach.  WIPT Leads submit funding requirements associated with their annual tactical plan submission to CPO.  The proposed activities are prioritized by CPO and funded based on merit and available funds.  Activities are accomplished by both government and contractor personnel.  Funds are transferred to government personnel through the MIPR process.  Funds are transferred to contractor personnel through competitively awarded contracts including the multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement held by CPO.  Progress on activities is reviewed tri-annually at meetings of the CPCIPT.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Missile Defeat Project counters the growing global advancement and proliferation of road-mobile ballistic missile threats.  This effort develops and integrates new capability and architectures to optimize fielded weapon systems and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) to defeat these emerging threats. 

The Missile Defeat Project coordinates and integrates Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) efforts to develop counter threat capability.  This effort measures the effectiveness of new architectures and revolutionary concepts against evolving threats by working with the IC, Combatant Commands, government labs, program offices, industry, and academia. 

To meet this challenge the Missile Defeat Project leverages existing test and simulated environments to perform analysis of industry and government reference concepts and architectures to provide innovative technical solutions for missile defeat.  We are developing virtual and physical testbeds to robustly test, evaluate, and prototype architectures and assess their ability to improve time critical targeting and defeat of road-mobile threats.  The virtual testbed complements testing at physical ranges by providing an infrastructure for addressing different training, test, and evaluation needs.  This effort also includes systems engineering and analysis to devolve technical requirements, identify promising solutions, and inform future investment decisions.

In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year FY 2017, the Department shall designate a military department or Defense Agency with acquisition authority with respect to missile defeat.  The Missile Defeat Project will transfer all activities and funding to other stakeholders starting in FY 2019.  The FY 2019 request enables this transfer without interrupting ongoing efforts.  

FY 2018 AMENDED BUDGET REQUEST JUSTIFICATION: $26.400 million Base is required to address emergency warfighting readiness requirements.  Funds are required for various classified projects.  Additional classified details can be provided under a separate cover.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) implements, maintains, and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy and places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  FY 2019 funds in the amount of $2.000 million are being transferred from PE 0603826D8Z for the continuation of Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) hardware and software assurance and integrity analysis activities planned across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).

Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG.  Its goal is to eliminate the Department of Defense (DoD)’s reliance on sole source foundries for trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics.  It supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities implementing three integrated, complementary solutions that:  (1) protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of microelectronics components; (2) improve capabilities to evaluate and validate the trust and assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentive the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial SOTA microelectronics technology.

This activity is being led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.  This activity is conducted, in coordination with the JFAC Steering Committee and the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Advisory Board, by performers, such as the JFAC service providers, Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), and other DoD and Intelligence Community S&amp;T organizations and laboratories in the area of hardware assurance (HwA) and software assurance (SwA).  It is integrating with, and supporting, the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related HwA and SwA S&amp;T actions.  This activity is also expected to maintain and update the DoD long-term microelectronics strategy based on feedback from the execution of this PE and enable and leverage commercial and academic relationships as necessary to fulfill this mission.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves microelectronics test and verification methodologies in support of verifying the trust and assurance of parts and develops standards and practices to foster commercial development of secure, trusted and assured parts.  Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories and other HwA and SwA capabilities are chartered as a JFAC to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technology nodes (&lt;45 nanometers (nm)), throughput/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities, in coordination with the JFAC, which prioritizes this investment as required to meet the realized and projected out-year demand for JFAC services.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:
•	Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards 
•	Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening/verification of select, critical parts
•	Design verification, i.e., verification/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.

These improvements address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.

This project develops and matures assurance mitigations, evaluates the effectiveness of protections of IP in support of integrity, and develops and validates obfuscation and disaggregation technologies.  The project will address physical validation tool and capability development, design software validation tool development, counterfeit detection and imaging techniques, and system vulnerability assessments and testbeds.

This project also develops standards and practices in support of assured designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of USG access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., assured designs and supply chains.

This project enables JFAC to provide hardware and software assurance and integrity analysis tools, services, best-practices, contract language, and other help to programs that detect, assess, prioritize, and mitigate mission critical vulnerabilities to malicious hardware and software attacks and supply chain exploitation vulnerabilities.  Additionally, the JFAC will provide capabilities for programs to keep assessment findings throughout the life cycle of their systems for data mining (e.g., documentation on rationale for previous mitigation decisions regarding software, hardware, and firmware.)  The collaboration between the JFAC and program offices will help mitigate existing and emerging critical threats and vulnerabilities in both software and hardware and yield secure architecture and design patterns available to all DoD programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies while maintaining the required level of assurance in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom, secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base IP from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of SOTA microelectronics assurance.

This program of research will develop innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted and assured strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.  It also develops, demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Assurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risk associated with sole-source suppliers and increase the Government’s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of developed technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies developed under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of vetted third-party IP and EDA tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

This project has received additional funding starting in FY 2019 to support microelectronics innovation efforts in the following focus areas:  capture and secure microelectronics R&amp;D; new microelectronics development, demonstration, and capability insertion; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and opto-electronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

• Design-For-Trust techniques
• IP protection
• Low-volume SOTA manufacturing
• Electronic component markers
• Imaging technologies and forensics
• Computing infrastructure and processing methods.

Primary efforts will include reducing-to-practice technologies enabling trusted (1) design, (2) access, (3) component integrity and (4) IP protection. FY 2018 primary activities include development of these technologies, followed by transition of these capabilities to new programs in the following fiscal years under PE 0605294D8Z.

This project will engage early on with potential stakeholders to identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles, and beta versions of tools, IP, techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area matures key technologies through rapid prototyping to develop DE capabilities while informing concept-of-operations (CONOPS) for operational use.  DE weapons provide the warfighter with scalable, targeted, and precision engagement while minimizing collateral damage.  This focus area will prototype advanced technologies required to enable the broad employment of DE technologies across the joint force.  Example technologies include compact, efficient energy generation, energy storage, and thermal management technologies; high efficiency laser diodes; advanced manufacturing and fabrication techniques; and, robust beam control technologies.  Specific activities include effects testing to quantify target susceptibility to DE; development, testing, and optimization of DE subsystems; and, integration of weapon prototypes.  These prototyping activities will enable faster transition of DE technologies to the warfighter by reducing technical risk, informing joint force CONOPS, and demonstrating the capability DE provides to the warfighter.  A cross functional team, led by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, will review and select prototyping proposals from across the Department of Defense in the year of execution.</r2:Description>

Specific activities include evaluating advanced attack or penetration systems; developing and replicating adversary techniques and procedures; using effective simulation and modeling; and, identifying mitigation strategies.  These prototype capabilities will reduce technical and integration risk and provide joint cross-cutting value to the warfighter.  A cross functional team, led by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, will review and select prototyping proposals from across the Department of Defense in the year of execution.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This is a twelve month project that developed and demonstrated prototypes to address emerging Service challenges resulting from the increasingly congested and contested electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) battlespace.  The EW project prototyped seven coordinated capabilities to expand the Army toolset, extend EW capabilities to lower echelons of troops, and address priority operational needs.  These capabilities include enhanced mobility for terrestrial signals intelligence (SIGINT), aerial and ground tactical EW systems, radio frequency interference mitigation, EW common visualization and planning tools, improved direction finding, and distributed dismounted EW systems.  Each of these technologies were tested in individual and integrated technical assessments with warfighter participation.  The prototypes leveraged partners from Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and industry.  Using FY 2017 funding, the capabilities individually transitioned to several programs of record in FY 2018 including Prophet; Terrestrial Layer Support (TLS) to Multi-Domain Battle/Joint Combined Arms Maneuver; Multi-Function Electronic Warfare Air-Large; and, EW Planning and Management Tool.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This twelve month project integrated commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies to provide PNT assurance by using emerging technologies for operations in a global positioning system (GPS) challenged environment.  Current Army systems lack a common, integrated PNT capability to enable free maneuver in an anti-assess/area denial (A2/AD) environment.  The PNT prototype system uses an enhanced defense GPS receiver (DAGR) device (ED3) with a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) accessory module to integrate multiple global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers; an embedded chip-scale atomic clock for independent timing; and, a native inertial navigation unit (INU) to provide a cross-checking reference signal.  The project developed platform-specific interfaces to integrate these COTS systems into the Abrams, Bradley, Paladin, and Stryker tactical vehicle platforms.  Using FY 2017 funds, additional platform integration, safety testing, technical assessment, and operational demonstrations with the warfighter will be completed in FY 2018.  The PNT prototype system and demonstrations informed senior Army leadership and transitioned to the Army PM PNT portfolio; Assured PNT, Mounted; and, Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) programs of record.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This twelve month project developed and prototyped a counter-UAS capability to automatically detect, track, and classify targets; and, provided threat alerts indicating small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) in complex land and shipboard environments.  The counter sUAS system integrated an all-passive sensor suite including acoustic sensors, wide-area electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) cameras, and high-speed EO and IR inspection cameras.  This prototype capability was developed to address shortfalls in the ability of currently deployed counter-UAS systems to detect emerging classes of targets.  The project also developed an open architecture fusion engine that correlates and classifies threats to alert an operator to sUAS incursions more rapidly than current systems.  Using FY 2017 funding, the prototype system was demonstrated against Class 1 and 2 UASs in a variety of operational environments in FY 2018.  This project directly supports a U.S. Strategic Command Joint Emerging Operational Need and a U.S. Central Command Joint Urgent Operational Need.  After a successful demonstration, the capability will transition to the Service and joint rapid capability fielding programs in support of multiple counter-sUAS efforts.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This twelve month effort prototyped and demonstrated capabilities to enable U.S. Marine Corps 21st century maneuver in complex terrain and contested littoral environments.  Prior to S2ME2, the Marine Corps did not have the equipment, training, or concept-of-operations (CONOPS) to operate in the increasingly non-permissive maritime domain.  This effort matured and demonstrated a subset of technologies identified in the S2ME2 2017 Advanced Naval Technology Exercise, which were validated at the Bold Alligator and Dawn Blitz 2017 exercises.  Specifically, S2ME2 focused on seven technology thrusts with disruptive potential: 1) Long Range Littoral Reconnaissance: Unmanned capabilities to safely increase the reach and situational awareness of individual Marines; 2) Unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR-T): Maturation of an existing commercial vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for shipboard operations; 3) Unmanned Fire Support: Precision fire support with autonomous magazines deployed from off shore staging forces; 4) Coalition Tactical Awareness and Response (CTAR): Extension of commercial satellite services to the Regiment level; 5) Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution (4GLTE) Long Range Communications: Modified commercial technology to provide ship-to-ship high bandwidth communications; 6) Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-jam Steerable Parasitic Array: A novel, low size, weight, power, and cost GPS antenna array with the ability to null jammers; and 7) Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection/Anti-Jam Communications: Replacement of omni-directional communications with tracked and targeted communication links.  For each thrust, S2ME2 investigated emerging and mature government and commercial technologies; developed requirements; integrated technologies on operational systems for relevant demonstrations; explored improved CONOPS; and, informed senior Navy and Marine Corps leadership on future procurement and training needs.  Following a series of live tests and field demonstrations, the S2ME2 project transitioned to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This twelve month project leveraged Air Force Research Laboratory experimentation to rapidly prototype an advanced High Power Microwave (HPM) capability.  Two HPM prototypes were developed to demonstrate stand-off, non-kinetic defeat of enemy unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and missiles.  The Tactical HPM Operational Responder (THOR) counter-UAS prototype provides an ability to address autonomous UAS swarms as part of an integrated base air defense.  The second HPM prototype, Counter Cruise Missile Extended Range Air Base Air Defense (ABAD), is designed to deliver sufficient power levels to negate cruise missile threats.  Both systems provide a low cost per shot and a deep magazine.  The HPM for ABAD project conducted risk mitigation for both prototype systems optimizing size, weight, and power; developed hardware and software solutions to increase lethality; validated desired effects; and, integrated subsystems for demonstration.  The two prototypes were technically and operationally assessed at multiple facilities with military operators.  The HPM prototypes will transition to the Air Force and Navy and will provide capabilities to the U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Strategic Command.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This is a twenty-four month project that combined open systems architecture standards; on-board, high-speed data communications with shared apertures; and shared processing to enable the rapid integration and fielding of new cutting-edge warfighting capabilities.  Open Mission Systems (OMS) is a non-proprietary, open standard that allows rapid integration of new capabilities and reduces vendor lock.  This project conducted research, development, and experimentation to expand OMS for next generation military capabilities.  In FY 2017, the project designed on-board, high-speed data communications and conducted a lab demonstration of representative OMS services using a government reference software.  Leveraging FY 2017 funds, the project continues to mature this capability through FY 2020, leading to a flight demonstration of on-board, high-speed data communications, together with OMS-compliant advanced services including timing, sensing, and communication.  The demonstrated capability will transition to multiple classified programs and support the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>MTR is a twenty-four month effort that developed distributed learning and training system that trains, prepares, and increases the performance of personnel in the Time Sensitive Targeting cell (TSTC).  MTR is a scenario-driven training system that enables an instructor to improve the speed and proficiency of target intelligence officers through realistic scenarios of increasing complexity.  The MRT project developed hardware hosted on the U.S. Pacific Command Joint Intel Operations Center (U.S. PACOM JIOC) and expanded a current intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) training system employed at Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory (LL).  With FY 2017 funds, the MRT system was technically assessed and demonstrated in FY 2018 with intel operators and instructors using real world scenarios, while also validating training scenarios specifically desired by the USPACOM JIOC TSTC.  The MTR reached initial operational capability at the U.S. PACOM JIOC TSTC and transitioned to U.S. PACOM JIOC.  MTR was developed to support U.S. PACOM’s JIOC TSTC cell specific training needs, but the capability is extensible to the TST cells in other Combatant Commands.  After full operational capability is achieved in FY 2019, the Mission Rehearsal Trainer will transition to U.S. Pacific Command for operational use.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Unmanned Systems (UxS) Common Development program is a joint effort to develop and demonstrate common standards, architectures, and technologies that address unmanned systems’ issues across all Military Services.  The intent is to increase interoperability and effectiveness by promoting cooperative development of solutions that are applicable across all unmanned systems.  This effort initially focused on addressing DoD unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), to include integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards. While UAS initially were the primary focus, interoperability among all unmanned and manned systems is the long-term goal.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Hawk and Triton, as well as other Group 3-5 UAS, need a sense-and-avoid (SAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.111 and Part 91.113, requirement to see-and-avoid other aircraft.  The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood, Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system will provide a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution. Long term GBSAA systems and Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) architectures, operating concepts, standards and technology are being developed to allow DoD, commercial and private manned and Group 1-5 Unmanned Aircraft to operate safely and effectively in the national Airspace.  
 
This joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
This was a new start program in FY 2017. This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the Department's intent to reinvigorate wargaming.  CAPE accomplishes this by leading wargaming activities, developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near- to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the vision of the Deputy Secretary of Defense to reinvigorate wargaming in the Department of Defense.  CAPE will accomplish this by leading wargaming activities; developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Text>FY 2017Accomplishments: Funds will be used for research and development in the key areas defined
by the Army, Navy, Air Force and various Agencies/Programs within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Investments are targeted to defense requirements within the budget year of execution. The defense wide focus areas for the FY2017 Rapid Innovation Fund Program include:  1) Deliver near term, emerging technologies to enhance the capabilities for current military operations, e.g., for soldier force protection, for anti-access / area denial operations, or for other near-term solutions that improves ongoing support to the forces;  2) Innovative technologies that enhance the affordability of defense operations, e.g., reduce the cost and footprint of fielded weapon systems, extend system life of aging platforms, or improve interoperability for portable, modular scalable and secure systems; and 3) Develop and demonstrate breakthrough technologies for future military capabilities, e.g., assured communications in space and man-made environments, improved position, navigation, sensors and sensor processing in GPS-denied environments, or for countering unmanned air or underwater systems.  FY 2017 funds will be distributed using a merit-based competitive process that considers the highest priority funding candidates across the military services (Army, Navy, Air Force), the 4th estate agencies, and key Combatant Commands.  Preferences will be given to funding small business proposals through a competitive broad agency announcement process.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Remarks>The defense wide focus areas for the FY2017 Rapid Innovation Fund Program include: 1) Deliver near-term, emerging technologies to enhance the capabilities for current
military operations; 2) Innovative technologies that enhance position, navigation, timing accuracies, improve targeting/delivery in GPS-denied environments and prevent
exploitation of systems lost in denied areas (e.g., anti-tamper capabilities); 3) Develop and demonstrate breakthrough technologies for future military capabilities. FY2017 funds
will be distributed evenly between the Services (Army, Navy, Air Force) and the fourth estate agencies.

Established in Section 1073 of the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Rapid Innovation Program is a competitive, merit-based program designed to
accelerate the fielding of innovative technologies into military systems pursuant to Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) phase II projects, Technologies developed by the
Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories and Other innovative technologies, including dual-use &amp; Independent Research &amp; Development (IRAD) technologies. The NDAA for
FY2017makes permanent authority for the Defense Research and Development Rapid Innovation Program.

There is a two-step competitive process for participation in the program. Industry is invited to submit white papers that meet the congressional and DoD criteria. Once those
white papers have been reviewed the highest ranking white papers are selected and invited to submit full proposals for consideration (there is no guarantee of an award). Those
full proposal go through a review and again the highest ranking full proposals are selected for negotiation and ultimately award.</r2:Remarks>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Radiological Detection System will provide a ruggedized Radiation Detection, Indication, and Computation for real time gamma radiation monitoring and low energy x-ray, beta, alpha, and neutron detection.

The Joint Personal Dosimeter will provide a joint solution to increase capability and reduce life-cycle costs.

Both systems will address Operation TOMODACHI (response to Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant incident) lessons learned for common, interoperable equipment with adequate sensitivity and common units of measure.</r2:Description>

Conventional Prompt Strike program and funding transfers to the Navy, PE 0604659N, starting in FY20.  Additional information is classified.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities.  The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities.  The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This sub-project develops technologies and applications that could lead to a system with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/ maneuverability to avoid overflight issues; controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area.  This sub-project also oversees development of non-nuclear warhead technologies to defeat time-sensitive targets for near and longer-term CPGS applications.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components. This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This sub-project will test and evaluate alternative booster and delivery vehicle options and will assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.  It will mature technologies that could lead to advanced systems with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/maneuverability to avoid over flight issues; and controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities.  The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: The JTIDS program supports collaborative efforts to achieve strategy-driven capability development spanning the suite of Department enablers to include Communications and Networks, Cyber, Command and Control (C2), Non-Intel Space and Business Systems. These efforts include conducting mission informed capability-based analysis; portfolio assessments to include analyzing modernization trends that result in the development of roadmaps or business area strategies that support balanced investment decisions; and monitoring and assessing Major Defense Acquisition Programs(MDAPs) , Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS), and defense Business Systems in a capability portfolio context.  Activities in the JTIDS project are divided into four areas:  (1) mission informed capability-based analysis; (2) Interoperability &amp; Integration; (3) roadmap development and support to business area strategies; and (4) support tools and guidance.  JTIDS also enables cross-department collaboration to enable enterprise-wide approaches. This includes:  (1) vertical and horizontal integration activities within the Department and with the interagency where appropriate; (2) engaging in a coordinated portfolio-based approach to planning,  programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) reform efforts at the legislative, governance, management and execution levels.  JTIDS is focused on capabilities-based portfolio management of the Department's key enablers, thus there are many shared equities with in ASD(A) and across OSD.  To fully meet mission need the JTIDS program supports extensive collaboration with  required alliances and with other OSD PSA's for Communications and Networks, C2, Non-Intel Space  and Business Systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The CIMB was established in 2012 in response to the FY2011 NDAA Section 933, where DoD was directed to provide a “strategy for the rapid acquisition of cyber capabilities, for cyber warfare for USCC and the Cyber Service components of the military departments. USD(AT&amp;L) is responsible for compliance with the FY2011 NDAA and Chairs the CIMB.
Funds provide technical, systems engineering, trend analysis, and oversight of programs, projects and activities developing cyber capabilities to maximize the Department's return on investment of cyberspace resources and effect a comprehensive approach for assessing, procuring, and sustaining critical cyber capabilities and cyber resilient systems and platforms from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of weapons systems performance and military operations.  Additionally, these funds will provide systems analyses, portfolio management, executive support of CIMB, enterprise wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to Cyber capabilities and ensuring cyber resilience within systems and platforms.  Resources will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance, cost parameters, determining and mitigating cyber risks of key systems and their dependencies.  The goal of this funding is to assure capability advantage, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts, minimize cyber related performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex systems, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address cyber security requirements, gaps and required technical solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $2.486 million to account for the availability of PY execution balances.  This reduction was based on FY 2017 expenditures as of September 30, 2017, and accounts for a 22% reduction in the CWP FY 2019 proposed budget.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Pilot Program is a result of a USD (AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

A number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY18 will continue defining and implementing DEF ‘best practices’ related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Pilot Program is a result of a USD (AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

A number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY18 will continue defining and implementing DEF ‘best practices’ related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding will be sufficient to support the number of systems included in the Defense Exportability Features Pilot Program that are used to define and implement DEF ‘best practice’ program management, system engineering, and program protection measures in the DoD acquisition process, and to cover more expensive follow-on DEF export design activities.

In FY 2017, the pilot program is anticipating initiating or continuing contracts for DEF feasibility studies or DEF design activities on the following previously selected systems (plus any new DEF Pilot Program designated systems selected by OSD for FY 2017 - 2018):
- Height of Burst Fuzing (US Air Force)
- Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (US Air Force)
- Joint Air to Ground Missile (US Army)
- Air and Missile Defense Radar (US Navy)
- Indirect Fires Protection Capability (US Army)
- Next Generation Jammer (US Navy)
- Miniature Air Launched Decoy (US Air Force)
- Land Mine Removal System (US Army)

(plus any new programs selected in FY16-17 that commence DEF studies or design activities)

- Review of major defense acquisition programs for exportability as part of the major milestone review process.
- Identify and select new pilot program candidates from Service Acquisition Executive nominations.
- Identify Service leads and subject matter experts, to provide support to programs, prior to Milestone B, to develop plans for exportability features. 
- Manage, resource, and track the completion of the contractor exportability feasibility studies and design activities. 
- Oversee drafting of DEF Lessons Learned, Interim Progress Review briefings, and Final Reports from DEF studies conducted in FY 2017.
- Draft and submit the annual Report to Congress on the program.

The focus for FY 2017 for the DEF pilot program will be to execute feasibility studies from newly selected DEF Pilot Programs that have yet to receive DEF funding, and to conduct follow-on DEF design studies on designated DEF pilot programs.  As with the FY 2016 programs, FY 2017 feasibility studies will define the required actions for incorporating DEF into programs, begin DEF designs on select designated programs, and assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&amp;L) will continue to engage with program offices through the Military Department DEF POCs, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other defense agencies to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A and B systems, OUSD(AT&amp;L)/IC will ensure the DEF feasibility studies are addressed in their program Acquisition Strategies and Program Protection Plans (PPP).  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&amp;L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies were executed.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the Department of Defense strategic, operational, and tactical plans and objectives transform the war fighter with new capabilities and doctrine, the budgeting and accountability of funds used to pursue the Department objectives will become more complicated and detailed for senior leaders to make decisions with supporting rationale for the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C).
  
NEXT GENERATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION TRACKING AND REPORTING TOOL:

No RDT&amp;E funds are requested.  

The Defense Financial Management Certification Program (DFMCP) meets the business requirement to comply with section 1051 of the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Public Law 112-81, authorizing the Secretary of Defense to establish a certification program for the 54,000 Financial Management (FM) workforce in order to improve audit readiness and analytic capability.  

The Department of Defense has a requirement to strengthen the professional development of the DoD financial management workforce and to ensure that DoD financial managers are properly trained to meet current and future requirements to support the Warfighter.  The DFMCP is the approved strategy to meet this requirement.  The DFMCP needs a tracking and reporting tool for web-based course training and exams, a robust reporting capability for standard and ad hoc reports, a course search capability, sort filtering capability, and a capability to attach multiple documents once the training certification requirements are completed.  The tool will self-guides users through the policies and procedures required by the program, without the burden of extensive training on how to use the system itself.  The tool will enable program operations, with embedded business rules, that represent policy and procedures, and have internal controls that prevent improper actions.  The tool will be intuitive, track and record activities, and enable users to perform correct actions the first time.  The tool will provide a reporting tool that furnishes leadership with near real time management reports concerning FM Workforce Certification Qualifications and be adaptable to reasonable changes in DFMCP policies and procedures.

UNIVERSE OF TRANSACTIONS:

Funding will support financial audit. A Universe of Transaction (UoT) inclusive of all Department of Defense (DoD) Wide Appropriation General Fund (TI-97) information is needed to support reconciliation of fifteen General Fund accounting systems, reconciliation of eighteen business feeder systems to general fund accounting system, and validating UoT capabilities through the audit examinations of DCMA and DoDEA.
	
The DoD TI-97 UoT requires:
• All supporting TI-97 data that rolls up to the DoD financial statement (detailed accounting data reconciled to the financial statement)
• Proof of the completeness of all transactional data reported within the UoT (detailed accounting data reconciled to business events)
• Ability to extract subset populations
• Ability to secure and protect the data within the UoT

The failure to meet these requirements will result in the Department unable to successfully conduct and pass an audit.

To achieve these requirements, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is creating a tool called the Auditable Universe of Data Intelligence Tool (AUD-IT).  This tool has the potential to significantly improve DoD’s capability and capacity to handle large volumes of standard and non-standard financial data.  Both an application and analytical platform, the AUD-IT leverages an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications to deliver a complete UoT for TI-97.  

The first phase of AUD-IT implementation is a proof of concept with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) systems to develop a baseline application and configuration.  When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current timeline for the proof of concept is estimated to be completed by December 2017.

AUD-IT is a joint effort between Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO), Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (ODCMO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), USSOCOM, and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).

The FY19 funds will be used to develop and implement a SIPR environment for Cost Accounting Framework to meet Operations Security (OPSEC) and Information Security (INFOSEC) requirements</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

OUSD(C) has taken the first step in getting the program back on track.  OUSD(C) and CAPE are working on a joint spiral development effort to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the DoD budget formulation process by consolidating multiple budget data collection points into a prototype for programming and budget data.  This would combine the collection of data performed by the existing applications Standard Data Collection System (SDCS) (Manpower, Forces, Pay Rates, DWCF), Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resources Collection Process (PRCP) (Procurement, Research Development Test &amp; Development, Military Construction and Procurement) and the Comptroller Information System (CIS).  This serves as an important proof-of-concept for future development of NGRMS.  Certain elements of agile development and the waterfall method are applied to provide incremental, staged improvements in functionality.

The prototype will provide a single, centralized user interface for the DoD components and agencies to submit their budget requests using a common, integrated budget structure, improving efficiency and effectiveness by removing redundancy and need for data reconciliation across multiple budget systems.  This initial phase will support capabilities to collect and feed the budget request data back to existing Comptroller and CAPE legacy systems (CIS, PRCP, and SDCS) to be further processed as part of the President's Budget submission process.  This effort is intended to expand into the next development phase of the NGRMS.

To prove the concept, OUSD(C) and CAPE have begun to capture and process Manpower (Military End Strength and Civilian FTEs) data.  The purpose of this prototype is to prove that budget submission data can be captured with a commonly defined data structure, transformed, and exchanged back to CIS, PRCP and SDCS in a seamless manner.  OUSD(C) and CAPE are currently working to define a standard set of submission data elements for collection of Manpower data.  The single submission prototype effort is intended to expand to include capture of all budget transaction types and will lead to NGRMS, the modernization and consolidation of multiple budget systems, implementation of next generation capabilities, and eventually, retirement of multiple legacy systems.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Investment Review Board approved the Department of Defense Financial Management Certification Program (DFMCP) Problem Statement on July 28th, 2016. The DFMCP meets the business requirement to comply with section 1051 of the FY 2012 NDAA, Public Law 112-8 for improved audit readiness and analytic capability of the 54,000-strong Financial Management (FM) workforce. 

The Department of Defense continues to use the Washington Headquarter Services Learning Management System (LMS) DFMCP system of record. LMS has performed barely adequately in implementing the certification program. A fair assessment by the program office is that despite three years of providing, improving and proliferating training, most FM LMS users and administrators cannot use the LMS proficiently. The result from the users’ perspectives is that the program is flawed, that achievement of certification is unnecessarily difficult, and that instead of enabling the DFMCP, the FM LMS is an obstacle to be surmounted. The FM workforce’s frustration with the FM LMS was raised by the Military Department Comptrollers and the Directors of the DFAS and DCAA as the most significant issue with the new FM Certification Program and an issue requiring immediate resolution.  This culminated with an Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) decision to explore other alternatives to the current FM LMS.  The existing FM LMS is a cumbersome and expensive system.

This effort is to plan, develop, test and implement the DoD Financial Management Certification Tracking and Reporting Tool (FM-CTRT) as a more efficient and cost effective solution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Without a single UoT to support the TI97 General Fund for the 4th Estate the Department will be incapable of asserting readiness for an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements.   All DoD organizations are pursuing the current statutory goal of achieving the state of audit readiness (target September 30, 2017) that supports entry into a full financial statement of audit in FY 2018 (target start date March 2018) with an initial opinion rendered in mid-FY 2019.  Without an automated capability to provide a transactional universe for sampling and evidentiary proof the department will not be in compliance with public law. 

The requested funds will be used to buy “Big Data” software and hardware infrastructure and required contractor services to implement the technology to meet the UoT requirement. 
This UFR includes subject matter expertise costs for DCFO and funds to be placed on a contract for hardware, software, and labor.  This will not result in hiring additional government personnel. 

The UoT will have the capability to:
•	Ingest data from multiple accounting and financial feeder systems
•	Normalize data from multiple sources providing a common data architecture
•	Reconcile transactional details to summary financial data
•	Provide auditor’s the ability to sample TI-97 detailed transactions
•	Business Analytics/Reporting
•	DATA Act which is a statutory requirement to be completed by May 2017
•	Provide NIPR and SIPR capability for non-sensitive and sensitive data

This effort is a proof of concept focused on USSOCOM, but will apply to all TI-97 general fund entities.  The scope is to bring in data from an estimated 50 systems and demonstrate existence and completeness of business and accounting transaction data, which are capabilities required for audit readiness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As part of the stand-up of this single IRB, Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) and DoD Components are charged with specifying and delivering required business outcomes for the Department. These business outcomes are then incorporated into the architecture and data products making up the Department's Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), under the oversight and direction of the Defense Business Council.  These metrics measure the incorporation of the Component identified business outcomes and associated component organizational alignments into the BEA. 


•  FY 2017 Goal: 100% of BEA discoverable data artifacts transitioned to a government cloud based information environment.
•  FY 2018 Goal: 30% of business outcomes and Business Capability Acquisition Cycle performance data incorporated into the BEA. This metric measures the discoverability of BEA content that supports DoD decision making.
•  FY 2019 Goal: 75% of business outcomes and Business Capability Acquisition Cycle performance data incorporated into the BEA. This metric measures the discoverability of BEA content that supports DoD decision

Section 2222 of Title 10, USC further required that the defense business enterprise architecture include an information infrastructure to enable the producing of timely accurate and reliable business information.  This metric measures the discoverability of BEA content that supports DoD decision making.

•	FY 2017 Goal: 100% of BEA data artifacts are discoverable via web services.
•	FY 2018 Goal: 100% of BEA discoverable data artifacts transitioned to a government cloud based information environment.
•	FY 2019 Goal: 60% of defense business system investment and portfolio analytical products leverage the BEA cloud based information environment</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY 2018, funds from this Program Element (PE) will be transferred to PEs in BA 4, 0604294D8Z and BA 5, 0605294D8Z to allow more efficient execution of developmental and prototyping activities within the body of work..</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities that will: (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted and assured microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.

This activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&amp;T) organizations and laboratories, the defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&amp;T activities.  

This activity implements, maintains, and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Additionally this activity places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves microelectronics test and verification methodologies in support of verifying trust of untrusted parts and develops standards/practices to foster commercial development of secure and trusted parts.  Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics trust verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories have recently been chartered as a Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technologies, throughput/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities in a collaborative nature amongst the core technical laboratories, driven by projected and realized out-year demand.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:

• Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards
• Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening/verification of select, critical parts
• Design verification, i.e., verification/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.

These improvements will address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform assessments.

This project also develops standards and practices in support of assured designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., assured designs and supply chains.

Beginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z, P645, to accurately reflect execution of funds in support of the mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Starting in FY 2017, this program funded a dedicated technical government subject matter expert (SME) at several JFAC laboratories and provided support for identified JFAC acquisition program pilots and non-program-related assessments, e.g., suspicious parts acquired by law enforcement or that failed in the field.  In addition, utilizing the 2015 JFAC hardware assurance capability survey, developed a plan of action based on incremental technical improvement and capacity across participating JFAC laboratories in the following areas:

• Equipment re-capitalization and new equipment
• Data and imaging processing
• Enhanced automation
• Technology and IP licensing
• Training and SME development
• Maintenance support
• Feasibility studies
• Reimbursable (test fixtures, boards, parts, and supplies)
• Direct program support in related areas beyond the acquisition programs’ technical capability or capacity to address.

The JFAC will: (1) improve its microelectronics test and verification methodologies in support of verifying trust and assurance of parts and (2) develop standards/practices to foster commercial development of secure, trusted and assured parts.

Cost sharing of direct program support prioritized for FY 2017 focused on addressing technical gaps and assurance-related findings.

This project also supported the following efforts that continue in FY 2018 under  BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z, P645:
• Improvements to the core JFAC’s (1) technical capability, i.e., laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software (SW), and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform assessments. Out-year demands will continue to require
an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of assessment capabilities.
• Enhancement of automation needed to increase the throughput of information produced by individual JFAC laboratory tools as well as to facilitate information sharing across the families of tools used for analysis and testing.
• Development of common SME training and protocols based on the existing tool base, to include both commercial and government-developed tools.
• Funding of an additional SME per core laboratory in support of the microelectronics trust verification and other JFAC-related work.
• Investment in the above technical areas based on priority and monitor and report increased technical capability from the baseline 2016 level.
Standards and Practices. Initiate the:
• Development of standards and best practices, and relationships with industry, to foster commercial development of secure and trusted parts.
• Establishment of formal relationships with FPGA vendors and other key commercial suppliers to improve device and IP security.
• Acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop design practices that minimize security flaws and facilitate verification.
• Establishment of government and industry working groups to develop test procedures to validate the trust of designs.
• Documentation and promulgation of security-enhancing design practices across government, industry, and academia.
• Development of industry-wide standards and practices to establish a common understanding of what constitutes verified and trusted hardware/software/firmware at both the component and systems level.
• Development of a common lexicon for secure hardware/software/firmware in collaboration with the Committee for National Security Systems, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the broader United States Government, industry, and academia.
• Definition of supply chain controls for assured chain of custody for critical and other microelectronics devices and IP.
• Development of security training and educate government and industry system security engineers and material managers on supply chain and life-cycle management best practices using agreed-upon language, standards, and practices.
• Alignment of DoD Instruction 5200.44 (Protection of Mission Critical Functions to Achieve Trusted Systems and Networks
(TSN)), related policies, and NIST 800-161 (Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and
Organizations) with industry standards identifying and addressing gaps in definition and criteria and establishing accepted levels of supplier and part trustworthiness.</r2:Description>

DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) IP from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.

This program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.   It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Assurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the USG’s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and EDA tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

Beginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z, P646, and BA 5 PE 0605294D8Z, P809.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This project started in FY 2017 with efforts that include demonstration of acquisition program pilots and technology demonstrations, and these efforts will continue under BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z, P646, and BA 5 PE 0605294D8Z, P809.  These activities will mature and evaluate trust technologies and techniques through efforts that may include the conduct of studies, Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) and other efforts to coordinate research programs across USG research and development (R&amp;D) organizations, academia and industry.

This project will engage early on with potential stakeholders to identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles and beta versions of tools, IP, techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities that will: (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted and assured microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.

This activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&amp;T) organizations and laboratories, the defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&amp;T activities.  

This activity implements, maintains, and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Additionally this activity places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop and demonstrate the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies, while maintaining the required level of assurance in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) IP from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.

This program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.  It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Assurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the ability of the U.S. Government (USG) to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and EDA tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

This project received additional funding starting in FY 2019 to support microelectronics innovation efforts that both enhance national security as well as the supporting DIB and domestic commercial microelectronics suppliers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PE 0305304D8Z was established in FY2013 and plays a pivotal role in the Department’s ability to achieve audit readiness, enhance the Department’s goal of energy efficiency, gain a full accountability of Real Property assets, as well as improve data quality and integration across the full spectrum of EI&amp;E business functions.  The PE helped conduct a full Business Process Re-engineering of the processes used to collect energy information, and publishing an EEIM data standard and a additional effort to build out data stores and portal requirements for Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) management.  Funding is also used to support ASD EI&amp;E Senior Real Property Officer accountability requirements by supporting management and oversight of reconciliation efforts and auditability by determining requirements for the department's Real Property inventory records and asset management processes, business rules and associated data standards.  A major component of this capability is an enterprise EI&amp;E Data Analytics &amp; Integration Support (DAIS) platform coupled with a independent verification &amp; validation capability. With access to real time data through services WSDLS, reports generated through business intelligence provide immediate indicators driving improved and quicker decisions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A key part of DoD’s strategy to meet its energy goals is to develop an energy information management environment that will enable the Services and OSD to track energy production and usage across the real property portfolio.  Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  Integration with accurate Real property asset, Utilization, Military Construction, Environmental, and installation Geospatial data is equally key to ensuring these decisions for planning and reporting are possible.  It also supports development of The geospatial portal for visualizing energy layers with other EI&amp;E data on installation or area maps for improved spatial analysis.  This portal is the DOD aggregated repository for DoD Common Installation Picture layers.  Additionally, the map viewer is customized and easier for OSD senior staff to manipulate and includes an online catalog of maps, documents and data; and a secure, robust data exchange module. This development supports a range of Joint Staff and OSD customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This is critical both from audit readiness and program management perspectives.  This funding provides the department independent verification and validation needed to reconcile errors to gain the data quality and interoperability needed for decisionable data and processes throughout the lifecycle of real property assets. Oversight and configuration management of business rules and standards are used to determine requirements for the departments Real Property inventory records and proper end to end process steps throughout the lifecycle of an asset from purchase to disposal.  This includes development and procurement of the enterprise data warehouse for integrating existing and future EI&amp;E systems and database needs.  The Real Property Unique Identifier (RPUID) process has also been included in this EI&amp;E enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort supports a multi-year real property-related control systems cyber security initiative to address these issues.  So far it has generated an updated DoD CIO RMF Knowledge Service Portal with controls systems cyber security implementation guidance for practitioners (templates, key references, step-by-step instructions, look-up tables, etc.)
Controls systems cyber security Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPS) has transitioned from Joint Base Architecture for Secure Industrial Control Systems (J-BASICS).  The department has begun to implement Platform Resilience Mission Assurance (PRMA) assessments across 10 installations.
This effort has also generated policy direction to Services and Agencies including a draft Department of Defense Instruction, a draft Department of Defense Manual and Security Handling Guide for data representing energy systems.</r2:Description>

Decrease due to budget decision INV-001 which rephrases 19 funds to FY20-21.  Fund at highest level possible since it is CYBERCOM funding provided for specific Cyber Security risks assessments and mitigation actions for facility related controls systems managed in the EI&amp;E business line.
Decrease in budget will significantly impact ability of program to meet its stated goal. At current levels of funding, up to half of installations scheduled and coordinated to be evaluated under the PRMA program will be canceled. There will not be enough data collected to complete FY18 and beyond goals for the establishment of department and enterprise wide cybersecurity solutions and methodologies.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds engineering and manufacturing development of CWMD systems, components, technologies, and/or applications, including system development and demonstration, and initial operational test and evaluation.  The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This project funds engineering and manufacturing development of CWMD systems, components, technologies, and/or applications, including system development and demonstration, and initial operational test and evaluation.  The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding supports the Defense Readiness Reporting System, (DRRS,) the comprehensive readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense mandated under Title 10 U.S. Code.  The system measures in an objective, accurate, and timely manner the capability of the armed forces to carry out the National Security Strategy prescribed by the President, as well as the defense planning guidance provided by the Secretary of Defense and the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new, more comprehensive system under DRRS, presents a number of significant challenges.  Included in these challenges is the expansion in scope of the entities who can, and do report readiness, as well as what they report.  Shifting from solely resource centric readiness reporting to a mission/capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting, but portrays a far more relevant and holistic picture of readiness.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  Additionally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs.  The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The holistic perspective of the application necessitates its need to operate in multiple domains.  Additionally, the highly complex data structures and visualization tools needed to support the Global Force Management - Data Initiative and critical down-stream consumers of readiness information, must now be implemented within DRRS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD.  This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

DRRS expands the scope of readiness reporting within the Department to create a more comprehensive assessment of the total force and its capability to perform the tasks and missions required of it to support the National Military Strategy.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  The program is the keystone for the readiness enterprise and architected to embrace the implementation of the Global Force Management - Data Imitative (GFM-DI), allowing for the Department’s efforts in the realm of Adaptive Planning and Execution to be fully supported.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems.  This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS.  Through this type of advanced information environment, the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force.  This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD’s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Departments 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches.  This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades - a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. Better Buying Power (BBP) is the implementation of best practices to strengthen the Defense Department's buying power, improve industry productivity, and provide an affordable, value-added military capability to the Warfighter.  Launched in 2010, BBP encompasses a set of fundamental acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability, cost control, elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy, and promotion of competition. BBP initiatives also incentivize productivity and innovation in industry and Government, and improve tradecraft in the acquisition of services. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.  To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and advance BBP initiatives to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element (PE) has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high-priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other Government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP PE support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).

    The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; cyber warfare; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments. Examples of project subject matter include highly accurate time-space-position information, electronic warfare test capability developments to address critical testing shortfalls against advanced threats, infrastructure developments needed for testing hypersonic weapon systems, network enhanced telemetry, information assurance and cyber testing and analysis capabilities, end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasures systems, net-centric weapons, and unmanned systems.  CTEIP continues to serve as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and linkages between test and training ranges. 

   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool, to link ranges to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing, and to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.

   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high-priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.

   This Budget Activity 6 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.

The FY2019 CTEIP budget is described in detail below. As part of the DoD reform agenda, the CTEIP budget was reduced for consolidation and reduction of service contracts. The FY2019 includes increased investments in high-priority hypersonic ground and open air range test capability developments and increased investments for critically needed upgrades to DoD Threat Models and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY2019 funding request was reduced by $1.302 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department’s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability that supports system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing which otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs. By linking distributed facilities, as well as providing the necessary tools, services and subject matter expertise, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  

In 2012, the National Cyber Range (NCR) transitioned from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  The NCR mission is to provide secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments to conduct cyber test, experimentation, and training events.  The NCR supports a wide-range of customers performing Developmental and Operational Testing, Cyber Mission Force Training and Certification, and support for operational contingencies.  In FY 2016, the Department, as a result of a study conducted by DASD(C3&amp;CB), recognized the magnitude of need for increased cyber test and training capacity and capability.  Based on this and other inputs, the Department increased funding in the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) in FY 17 to build out additional cyber T&amp;E capacity based on the National Cyber Range (NCR) architecture.  This increased capacity will also be available to conduct training for the Cyber Mission Force.  The TRMC worked with the Services to identify facilities where this buildout could be accomplished most efficiently.  They also considered additional criteria such as accessibility by acquisition programs, availability of qualified work force, utilities and network availability, timing, and expected cost.  

To date, TRMC and the Services have identified five sites that are potential candidates.  We have begun detailed design in FY 17, to prepare for beginning the build-out in FY 18.  Once complete, the Department will have well over four times the cyber test and training capacity offered by the current NCR.

The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program, the National Cyber Range, and oversees both their development and test conduct.  In order to meet the significant growth in requirements, TRMC will use the increased funding for FY 18 to substantially increase cyber test and training capacity by 1) refurbishing the current NCR hardware that is nearing end-of-life and increasing computing capacity to support additional customers; 2) procuring and fielding additional enterprise computational and storage resources for JMETC’s Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDPs) capability; and 3) begin construction of a new high capacity cyber range similar to the NCR.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JMETC mission is to provide an enterprise-level, persistent capability for linking distributed facilities, enabling Department of Defense (DoD) customers to develop and test warfighting capabilities in a Joint Context. JMETC provides a test infrastructure consisting of the components necessary to conduct Joint distributed test events by cost-effectively integrating live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) test resources that are configured to support the users' needs.  The JMETC program provides its customers a support team to assist with JMETC products and the conduct of distributed testing.  JMETC’s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  JMETC Program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&amp;E.  JMETC has grown from four sites in 2007 to well over 100 functional sites by the end of FY17.  JMETC will reduce the cost and time to plan and prepare for distributed joint testing by providing a readily-available, persistent connectivity with network security accreditation support, common integration software for linking sites, and accredited test tools for distributed testing. To support its customers, JMETC also provides extensive expertise in planning, preparing for, and executing the infrastructure for distributed test events.  Additionally in FY 2013, the JMETC mission included developing and fielding the Regional Service Deliver Points (RSDP) to support testing and training.  The RSDPs are a set of distributed computing and storage platforms designed to efficiently meet DoD capacity and capability demands for distributed and cyber test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements as part of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  They provide services (i.e. traffic generation, simulation, instrumentation, visualization, and integrated event management), a scalable architecture to increase capacity and capabilities as needed by the user community, a flexible and adaptable infrastructure to support users requirements which are prone to frequent change, and to deliver cost and performance efficiencies (virtualization, rapid reconstitution).  At a high-level architecture view, the RSDP adds enterprise compute and storage resources as well as a platform for distributed and cyber T&amp;E tools and services at multiple classifications necessary to create high fidelity, operationally representative virtual environments, previously unavailable.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2013, responsibility for the National Cyber Range (NCR) was transferred to the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) and subsequently aligned under the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) Program Element.  Since then, the NCR has executed 200+ events for DOD Customers.  The NCR provides secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration/federation of cyberspace test and evaluation (T&amp;E) infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission. The NCR is accredited to operate at TS//SI-G/TK/HCS-P//SAR.  As a result of recent recapitalization and capacity enhancement efforts, the NCR now has the capability to support up to 8 concurrent events and scale up to ~250K virtual nodes. The NCR concurrently emulates complex (Red/Blue/Gray) operationally representative network environments at different classification levels using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) architecture. The NCR Test Automation Tool Suite minimizes human error, enables verification of test environment, ensures repeatable results and reduces event timelines from weeks/months to hours/days.  NCR computing assets can be sanitized after exposure to malicious attacks/malware and restored to a known, clean state. The NCR conducts distributed events with other Cyberspace Ranges via the JMETC MILS Network (JMN) and Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR).

The NCR conducts Cyberspace Testing, Training and Operational Events for the full spectrum of DoD Customers including Research, Development, Acquisition, Testing, Training and Operational Cyber Mission Forces. The NCR executes wide variety of event types including Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Demonstrations, Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (OT&amp;E), Security Controls Assessments (SCA), Cyberspace Operations Training, Cyberspace Tactics, Techniques Procedures (TTP) Development, Forensics/Malware Analysis) and Cyberspace Operations Mission Rehearsal.  The NCR enables acquisition programs to conduct Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) in a representative Cyberspace Environment to identify and close exposed vulnerabilities, evaluate resiliency and positively impact program cost, schedule and performance.  The NCR also supports Training and Certification of Cyber Mission Forces in support of US Cyber Command by enabling operational forces to efficiently evaluate cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment. Finally, the NCR is supporting in real time Overseas Contingency Operations as directed by National Authority.

In FY 2016, the Department, as a result of a study conducted by DASD(C3&amp;CB), recognized the magnitude of need for increased cyber test and training capacity and capability.  Based on this and other inputs, the Department made the decision to increase funding in the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in FY 17 to build out additional cyber T&amp;E capacity based on the National Cyber Range (NCR) architecture. This increased capacity will also be available to conduct training for the Cyber Mission Force.  The TRMC worked with the Services to identify facilities where this buildout could be accomplished most efficiently.  They also considered additional criteria such as accessibility by acquisition programs, availability of qualified work force, utilities and network availability, timing, and expected cost.

To date, TRMC and the Services have identified five sites that are potential candidates.  We have begun design and cost estimation in FY17 so that we can begin detailed design and begin build-out in FY 18.

Studies and analyses will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, providing essential means for managing and responding to the shifting and complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  Independent analyses from subject matter experts are instrumental for senior defense planners in making informed choices regarding requirements for force planning and strategic deployment of assets taking into account technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the findings of operational analysis in force planning requirements and projections. With the complexities of emerging advanced security threats in the current geopolitical environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning to inform senior leadership for the mid and long-term is vital to remaining strategically competitive.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program conducts approximately seventy-five actions per fiscal year to support a wide variety of national security goals of the Department and is designed to encourage a collaborative research approach among the components of OSD and the Joint Staff.  The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives, the Quadrennial Defense Review, the President's National Security Strategy, and the National Military Strategy of the United States of America.

In following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope of studies and analyses has been limited as necessary in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance and needs to the Department of Defense while continuing to make every effort to support requirements for the Office of the Secretary of Defense developing from legislative direction.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) on systems engineering, development planning, program protection, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense (DoD).  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for: (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems, system security, and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance manufacturing, reliability, availability, maintainability, and software and hardware assurance, on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs) and major automated information systems (MAISs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) and program protection plans (PPPs) for MDAPs and MAISs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering, assurance and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) develops new methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) incorporating state of the practice into system engineering for the DoD in both weapon system design, and design tools.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP and PPP for each MDAP and MAIS, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering, program protection, and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  Based on the DASD(SE)’s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense regarding systems engineering, development planning, program protection and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program’s systems engineering, development planning, program protection planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.

The DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering across the Department.  The DASD(SE) improves DoD’s SE capabilities through advocacy, oversight, policy, and guidance for the acquisition workforce responsible for Engineering, and Production, Quality &amp; Manufacturing (PQM); in Engineering Tools and Environments; and in Specialty Engineering.  

The DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  The DASD(SE) prepares and submits a bi-annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.

This PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department’s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of the DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews.

Beginning in FY 2019, this PE will support activities to carry out responsibilities described in Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 855 titled Mission Integration Management (MIM).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of the Nuclear Matters program is to sustain the U.S. nuclear deterrent posture, counter nuclear threats, and to develop nuclear and conventional physical security equipment. The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

There's increased risk, absent nuclear testing, in assuring long-term safety and reliability of today’s aging stockpile—the legacy warheads left over from the Cold War.  Today’s nuclear weapons complex is not sufficiently “responsive” to technical problems in the stockpile, or to potential emerging threats.  The task is to ensure the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure, meets long-term national security needs.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Global Positioning System (GPS) User Equipment Synchronization with GPS space and operational control segments to conduct DoD CIO oversight of Global Positioning System (GPS) management and planning activities required for meeting JCIDs requirements. Funding supports policy and guidance for incorporation of alternative means of PNT delivery to augment GPS. Funding also supports the DoD’s PNT Oversight Council and inputs into interagency activities under the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee. 
The Integrated Planning and Management Project encompasses the National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office's (NMO) responsibilities for establishing overall DoD policy and oversight with respect to the capability development, interoperability, standards, and architecture for National and Nuclear Command Capabilities for our National Leadership.  The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO’s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office with oversight of a wide range of DoD command, control, and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Three overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP), DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Nuclear C2, Integrated Missile Defense, Tactical Warning, Global Strike; and 3) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings.

The Mission Assurance Risk Management System (MARMS) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management system that directly supports the Secretary of Defense’s Mission Assurance (MA) responsibilities as defined in the DoD Directive (DoDD) 3020.40, Mission Assurance, with the objectives of creating resilience and supporting critical processes to enable the protection of assets and ensuring defense critical missions. MARMS will function as an integration framework spanning multiple security domains that will support risk-informed decision-making, resource investment, and improved synchronization at different levels within DoD. MARMS supports multiple Joint Capability Areas (JCA): Command and Control, Logistics, and Protection. MARMS is an acquisition category (ACAT) III software program and has a “high” impact value for each of the three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01 and the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253.


Defense Architecture Support includes development, analysis, testing and evaluation of DoD IT Enterprise Reference and solution architecture products in support of the DoD's Joint Information Environment and the closely related Mission Partner Environment.  This work also includes improvements to processes that support registration and storage of the Department's enterprise architecture (formerly called DARS). The Department maintains a catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to store, search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data through capabilities provided by the architecture portal.  The portal is a central, federated hub for discovery, accessibility, understandability, and reusability of architectures.  With the ability to import different architecture tool data and display disparate architecture data in a uniform, consistent method for ease of use and understanding.  The portal provides a federated environment for sharing of architectures, mission threads, and other related capability integrated information between various authoritative repositories to increase effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making in a dynamic environment by our customers.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the Defense Architecture Support program focus on: (1) Research and Development of JIE and MPE architectures, (2) Making JIE and MPE architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build "composite" integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO's collaborate in the development of federation web services via the Enterprise Architecture and Engineering Panel under the oversight of the DoD CIOs Enterprise Architecture and Service Board to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model, enterprise services, data and technical standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ISR Operations initiatives fulfill the requirement for expert engineering and technical assessments on a wide range of ISR operational issues used to support senior level discussions and decisions on ISR Operations related initiatives, platforms, and sensors. The ISR Operations initiatives developed, expanded, and enhanced a prototype framework to ingest and process asset allocation, requirements, tasking, and post-mission artifacts and collected sensor data and analyst intelligence products in order to provide semi-automated assessments for CENTCOM/Joint Intel ISR assessments analysts. 

ISR Operations initiatives provide expert engineering and technical assessments on a wide range of ISR issues; establish and maintain interfaces with the senior scientific and technical directorates within OUSD(I), the military services and the Combat Support Agencies; integrate ISR Operations technology roadmaps with related program plans and initiatives; and support senior level discussions and decisions on ISR Operations related initiatives, platforms, and sensors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The SBIR/STTR Program is executed in three phases. The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II awards are made to firms that have been awarded a Phase I contract on the basis of the results of their Phase I effort and the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of the Phase II proposal. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DoD Office of Small Business Programs is tasked with providing Departmental SBIR/STTR policy guidance, oversight and implementation and therefore requires program element (PE) 0605790D8Z to fund these administrative activities. In addition to funding costs for program administration, coordination and execution, PE 0605790D8Z funds essential elements of the SBIR/STTR Program that are required by law including: 
(1) Coordinate and execute the administrative portions of the DoD SBIR/STTR Programs including the development of technical topics, preparation of SBIR/STTR R&amp;D solicitations and receipt of proposal responses; 
(2) Maintain and modify automated processes across the entire SBIR/STTR lifecycle including the development and maintenance of information systems and software required for the measurement, evaluation, and effective management of the Department's SBIR/STTR Programs; 
(3) Implement an aggressive outreach program including the execution of two National conferences and outreach to small technology companies, potential investors in such companies, SDBs, WOSBs, Institutions of Higher Learning, underrepresented states, and others, to facilitate participation in the SBIR/STTR Programs; 
(4) Coordinate oversight, collect results, track execution and provide reporting of Phase II technology transition in the DoD SBIR Commercialization Readiness Program (CRP); and 
(5) Prepare all reports mandated by law and policy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for research and engineering (R&amp;E) matters.  In this capacity, the USD(R&amp;E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) R&amp;E programs.  Additionally, the USD(R&amp;E) provides technical support on R&amp;E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&amp;E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&amp;E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the USD(R&amp;E) (OUSD(R&amp;E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and its impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts.  

The PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the USD(R&amp;E).  The Defense Laboratory Office mission is to craft policy and provide the oversight necessary to both preserve current and develop future DoD in-house laboratory capability such that they continue to generate mission-critical innovations that increase the U.S. military advantage and enhance U.S. national security.  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and supports the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) personnel and quality of workforce; and (3) technology transfer.

The PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the USD(R&amp;E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program and to ensure that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis project conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds and to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&amp;T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.

The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&amp;E programs resides in the USD(R&amp;E).  The USD(R&amp;E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.

This PE also provides funding for Data Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative/mitigation actions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The DoD Laboratory Enterprise consists of more than 60 laboratories with approximately 67,000 employees (approximately 40,000 of whom are scientists and engineers).  The Defense Laboratory Office develops plans and investment strategies for laboratory infrastructure, technology transfer programs, and personnel development.  Section 211 of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) also transferred the management of the laboratory demonstration program at Science and Technology Reinvention Laboratories (STRLs) from the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&amp;R)) to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)).  Section 218 of the FY 2018 NDAA amended the authority by redesignating management to the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The FY 2016 funds were issued to the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) for execution.  AMRDEC drafted the Partnership Intermediary Agreement (PIA) Work Description, the topic of which was “Technology Transfer, Avionics Technology, and Teaming for Future Tactical Operations Challenges.”  This was applied to both aviation and unmanned platforms and was competed among a variety of institutions, including those in academia.  After the open competition, Wichita State University was selected as the Partner.  The Defense Laboratories Office plans to apply the FY 2017 Congressional Add to the same PIA announcement.</r2:Text>

Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department, and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base.  To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities.  DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result in the loss of this information.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities.  This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production, and component manufacturing.

This project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information, and an analysis of losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project integrated the Department’s critical acquisition and technology list with a Joint Requirements Oversight Council critical technology and capabilities list.  For the remainder of FY 2018, the project will collocate the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) joint analysis capability with DoD’s Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO).  The project will integrate collection efforts to produce one list of critical acquisition programs and capabilities that identify the Department’s critical acquisition programs that are tiered for proactive protection efforts.  It will continue to develop links to the security community and adjust to the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 901 mandated reorganization to develop enhanced protection for critical acquisition programs and technologies.  The project is linked with the DoD cross functional team (CFT) on Maintaining DoD Technological Advantage and will begin to adapt joint analysis capability to address any changes in the Department’s strategic direction.  In FY 2018, the program identified an initial set of resources for FY 2019 and will plan future resource requirements for enhanced protection of critical acquisition programs and technologies, adjusted for the FY 2017 NDAA reorganization.  The program will standardize projects to identify feasible protection and safeguards; develop dynamic links with program protection planning activities; and demonstrate advanced analytic tools, coupled with identification of additional information feeds/sources of data.</r2:Text>

The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future. Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979, and extended by Presidential Executive Order, to review militarily critical goods and technologies, and to consider worldwide technology capabilities, the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally-mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons. 

Specific activities include:
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Provide limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identify and determine technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identify foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides resources to support Acquisition Program Managers, Chief Developmental Testers, and Lead DT&amp;E Organizations in the development of comprehensive and efficient DT&amp;E strategies to support key acquisition milestones and engineering decisions.  This project also manages the Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) career field and curriculum for the DoD acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within DoD, and prepares reports to Congress as required.  Specific activities include the following:

- The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense DT&amp;E (DASD(DT&amp;E)) ensures that test strategies beginning at Milestone A, are documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  DASD(DT&amp;E) reviews and approves/disapproves the developmental test and evaluation strategy within the TEMPs.
- Provide formal DT&amp;E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) pre Milestone B, and begin production, Milestone C, with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. 
- Managing the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE).  Over the last four years, the STAT COE has supported over 40 Acquisition Program Managers in the development of statistically optimized test programs.  These efforts have resulted in 175 more efficient and effective test plans and a test cost avoidance of about $160M.
- Coordinate with the Test Resources Management Center (TRMC) to identify DoD test infrastructure gaps and support development of the TRMC strategic plan.
- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&amp;E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the SE and development planning processes of the Department.
- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&amp;E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and cybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).
- As the T&amp;E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance the T&amp;E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&amp;E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, as well as the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.

In FY 2019 CAPE received increased funding from the DoD Joint Service Provider to support the migration, implementation, and sustainment of its DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts. In addition to the one-year increased RDT&amp;E funding in FY 2019 described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding throughout the FY 2019-2023 FYDP to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental solutions. CAPE's  funds are included in the total Internet DMZ Migration amount transferred from JSP to OSD so that CAPE and three other affected OSD Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) can execute their own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The FY 2019 one-year funding increase reflects CAPE's share of a transfer from the DoD Joint Service Provider to various OSD Principal Staff Assistants in support of the migration, implementation, and sustainment of DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts. In addition to the increased RDT&amp;E funding described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental efforts. These funds will enable CAPE to initiate the execution of its own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance DoD senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In addition to the increased RDT&amp;E funding described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental efforts. CAPE's  funds are included in the total Internet DMZ Migration amount transferred from JSP to OSD so that CAPE and three other affected OSD Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) can execute their own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ.</r2:Description>

• Adhere to guidance outlined in DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
• RDT&amp;E OPSEC capabilities, systems, tools, products, and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures signature management and signature obfuscation capabilities are available for DoD components.
• Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
• Continue to support the warfighter’s need for capabilities that dominate today’s dynamic, networked battlespace by providing strategy across the DoD for the planning and execution of OPSEC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E performance metrics are used to establish baseline and assess progress toward enhancement and increase of OPSEC capabilities and capacities across the DoD’s assigned responsibilities. The following metrics are based on the ROI of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for OPSEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E successes across the Department:
- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered next generation capabilities address CCMD and/or DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed capabilities includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

• Adhere to guidance outlined in DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
• Acquire and sustain MILDEC capabilities, systems, tools, products, and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures information related capabilities are available for DoD components.
• Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
• Continue to support the warfighter’s need for capabilities that dominate today’s dynamic, networked battlespace by providing governance, oversight, and strategy across the DoD for the planning and execution of MILDEC activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The following metrics are based on the return on investment of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for MILDEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E successes across the Department:
- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered next generation capabilities address CCMD and DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed capability development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories, and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Capabilities and Innovation (ICI) funds Project Intelligence Innovation which is the development, testing, prototyping and demonstration of innovative intelligence capabilities to integrate intelligence and counterintelligence activities across numerous domains and technical areas including signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurements and signature intelligence (MASINT), electronic warfare, cyber, geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), multi-sensor integration, biometrics, identity management, collection management, special communications, clandestine operations, and tagging, tracking and locating.  Innovation is the rapid experimentation and development of existing technologies (hardware, software, licenses, databases, analytics, etc.) to create new capabilities and demonstrate their intelligence value in support of warfighter operations.

Beginning in FY 2019, ICI also funds Project Maven which fields increasing amounts of automation to Full Motion Video (FMV) ground exploitation stations for Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude and High Altitude ISR platforms. Maven uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon). Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts  can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from GEOINT. Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Project Maven will use Rapid prototype sprints to field increasing amounts of automation to FMV ground exploitation stations for TUAVs, Medium Altitude and High Altitude ISR platforms. Maven will use artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon).  This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision into the process of object detection, identification, and tracking at computer process speed versus human speed. Incorporating computer vision and algorithms will reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data. Project Maven will develop algorithms focused on tactical UAV FMV automatic target recognition (ATR) and an operational PED environment for platforms and ground stations. AW will build capabilities, integrate AI and machine learning (ML) to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for object detection, classification and user alerts.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, test and evaluations efforts to support planning, development, and sustainment of CWMD technologies, including situational awareness information systems, or other systems as needed.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program transfers to the Joint Staff (PE 0804767J) beginning in FY 2018.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  The funding increase beginning in FY 2016 represents planned growth and internal reprogramming decisions to accelerate development of a cloud-enabled joint training environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Joint Simulation System (JSS)
- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)
- U.S. Forces Korea Training &amp; Exercise Support (USFK)
- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and SOF joint training and enabling capabilities that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint collective training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. The enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program will focus efforts on improving, rather than consuming, readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  The JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO and multinational partners. The Joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS’s intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners.

JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the JS J7 program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD T2 JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, and reporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, IA training; and OSD required training (externally funded).  JKO also expends funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance specific aspects of the training capability as required for J7 support to Combatant Commanders. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content.

USFK:  FY 2015 is the last year for dedicated funding within the overall program.  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training &amp; Exercise Support program develops simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&amp;E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.  

Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based capabilities for integration into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements, and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and Coalition Forces and ensures sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands to train as they operate.  The funding requested continues development of exercise Scenario Management Tools and services that support planning and execution of joint training, and continued maturation of a single integrating architecture for Joint Training.  Funding supports the development of cloud-enabled modular training application services.  Program intent is to reduce dependence on touch labor, and mitigate the impact of reductions in operation and sustainment funding.  Focus must be maintained to deliver operationally relevant training environments and respond to changes in the warfighter’s operational environment.  JNTC enables the Department of Defense to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices. In FY 2017, this investment continues expanding access for Service and Combatant Command trainers to plan and execute joint training.  Funds support improved relevance and realism of training by providing capabilities that replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Title>Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)</r2:Title>
                                                    <r2:Description>JNTC provides the technical standards, architecture (blueprint), and development processes required to integrate/link joint training programs.  The Joint Training Environment is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes, and accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating specific actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience.  This enhances the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  Funding in this account supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  Technical integration enables selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command Headquarter levels.  The funding supports modernization of the Joint Training Environment (JTE) to increase warfighter access to automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE) through web-based and cloud capabilities. 

The Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the Joint Force to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed JLVC enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and CJCS High Interest Training Issues identified in the Chairman’s Annual Training Guidance.</r2:Description>

•  Invest in IT capabilities that continue to modernize Joint Staff J-7's Suffolk data center to support virtualized, cloud-enabled delivery of training capabilities to Services and Combatant Commands.  Investments support the shift to a joint training strategy whereby more realistic training is available as the joint force more heavily relies on training from home station. 
•  Continue development of Joint Training Environment tools/services that support reduction in out-year training operations and sustainment costs, for planning, designing, provisioning, and executing Combatant Command and Service joint training activities.  
•  Continue development of cloud management services that provide on demand, auto-initiated, and load-balanced Joint Training Environment services (i.e., data, simulation, planning tools, virtualized command and control, etc.).
•  Release beta version of the new Joint Training Tool software that uses the modernized IT architecture. 
•  Develop role-play capability in Joint Training Tools such that users are able to access only their particular software capability and data, (e.g., a red force planner has access to red force laydown). 
•  Investigate opportunities to use the Joint Information Environment Mission Partner Environment to meet coalition training requirements. 
•  Continue to align IT infrastructure with Joint information Environment requirements.</r2:Text>

JKO LCMS is necessary to develop, host and deliver JKO courses and track/report students' progress, completions and survey results more effectively and efficiently.  JKO LCMS extends web-based, distributed access to mission-critical joint training requirements.  There are currently over 2.7 million registered users of the JKO LCMS. 
•  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and pre-requisite JKO courses enable blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises that augment the Joint Event Learning Cycle and in meeting combatant commanders exercise objectives. 
•  JKO mobile application training device development: Development and enhancements facilitate the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (cell pones and tablets). JKO Mobile App extends access to training courses and learning resources to personal use of mobile phones and tablets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JKO will continue to test, evaluate, and provide enhancements to ensure compliance with cybersecurity of all Joint Content Management Architecture (JCMA) components. Requirements will be derived from CCMD user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by DASD(R) for JKO to “develop content for pre-exercise training and support—as required by the Army, Marine Corps and supported GCCs—and support individual and unit training for REF/SP-MAGTF missions.”  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve cybersecurity and the ease of use for the current 40,000 daily log-ins and 450,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by easing their requirement to access, complete and retain mandatory joint individual web-based training. Additionally, this retention benefits them as a precursor to their participation in numerous CCMD exercise training events.  JKO must continue to evaluate and enhance its architecture to maintain performance standards and remain on the leading edge of distant learning technology as we confront an austere fiscal environment and the tremendous demand of JKO capabilities.  
• Develop, test, and deliver 4 JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS).  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for CCMD exercise participants.  The SGST will be used as part of the OSD endorsed Blended Learning Training component in approximately 8 CCMD collective training exercises to prepare individuals serving on CCMD required small functional teams and C/JTF ‘battle staffs’.  Individual training proficiency improvement will be measured and quantified as part of the exercise design.  Additionally, SGST is expected to support enhancement of  the SEJPME training by enabling synchronous and asynchronous CAPSTONE-type capability.  JKO will continue to enhance functionality based on user experience and feedback. 
• JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing its comprehensive plan to develop mobile training device capabilities focused on JKO’s entire Joint Individual Training Toolkit.  Planned components include existing JKO courseware and video conversions to portable, hand-held devices, emerging FY 2017 training courseware requirements interoperable with portable, hand-held devices while leveraging of other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware for delivery on the JKO Mobile App. JKO plans develop or convert approximately 150 training courses, eBooks, Podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in the reduction in costs for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered onsite and on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide.  JKO will continue to enhance its mobile capability based on user experience and feedback.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training &amp; Exercise Support program developed simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) was a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&amp;E program.  This solution is capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution contains enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JTSE (previously JLVC 2020) simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program developed a jointly accredited, supported, and funded federation of constructive models and simulations which are capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations (and which is interoperable with KSIMS).  While supporting U.S. Forces Korea specific training requirements, this solution was inextricably linked to the JTSE modeling and simulation capability via Cloud-Enabled Modular Services.  It provided a common, interoperable simulated battlespace which realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences (tactical to strategic) in Korean theater exercises and across the Combatant Commands, Services, and coalition Partners.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS), directed in Title 10 USC Section 2508, provides the Department with a unique capability to achieve the strategic goal of a strong, resilient, responsive and healthy US Industrial Base (IB) that improves the Departments force readiness posture.  This program is uniquely positioned to improve the US Industrial Base’s ability to respond to the Departments needs by applying focused investments (as directed in 10 USC Sec 2508) to: 1) monitor and assess the current state of the IB, 2) address critical issues in the IB relating to Urgent Operational Needs, 3) address supply chain vulnerabilities and, 4) support efforts to expand the Industrial Base. 

Manufacturing dominance underpins technical dominance. A healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains are essential to the economic strength and national security of the United States.  The ability of the United States to maintain readiness, and to surge in response to an emergency, directly relates to the capacity, capabilities, and resiliency of our manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains. 

IBAS is fundamental to achieving a modern IB that integrates traditional and emerging sectors to be able to respond at will to National Security Requirements. 

IBAS investments focus on addressing Industrial Base issues that support defense needs by identifying and closing gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and creating and sustaining reliable sources. Key areas of IBAS investment will include:
1)	advancing and sustaining both traditional and emerging defense manufacturing sectors, 
2)	preserving critical and unique manufacturing and design skills, 
3)	supporting and expanding reliable sources, and 
4)	identifying and mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>IBAS mission is to strengthen the force posture and readiness of the U.S. Defense Manufacturing and Industrial Base to respond at will to national security needs.

The IBAS program has a multi-pronged approach to identify projects: 1) assessments of the national technology and industrial base by the OSD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L) office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP) as directed by 10 U.S. Code 2505, and 2) working directly with defense programs, and 3) working directly with industry. MIBP collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the Title 10 USC Section 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base critical to a healthy defense industrial base:

1) Gaps in national-security-related domestic manufacturing capabilities
2) Threatened, single, or sole source capabilities especially within the lower tiers
3) Education and manufacturing workforce skills 

IBAS investments seek to ameliorate industrial base and manufacturing issues to strengthen the defense industrial base. All projects are evaluated for industrial base risk using fragility and criticality risk criteria, similar to the more familiar probability and consequence risk criteria.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific capability likely to be disrupted.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific capability difficult to replace if disrupted. 

IBAS currently focuses efforts and investments in four categories:  Radars, Sensors, and Electronics Sectors; Materials Sector; Munitions and Missiles Sector; and Cross-cutting Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Mitigation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These limitations of technology can be overcome by identifying common industrial base challenges, development of sustainable modular and scalable architectures, supported by a strengthened and broadened domestic supplier base. Sector investments will improve production process efficiencies, explore modular and scalable technology, and upgrade outdated radar and sensor technology.

National Security Space Programs: Work will be completed on identifying cost drivers and develop improvements in space-based sensors that builds upon ManTech work on material for MCT infrared focal plane arrays.  A new project will be initiated to preserve capability by manufacturing additional wafers targeting the performance requirements for space infrared sensors.

High Performance Carbon Fiber: A number of specialized (high-strength and high modulus) carbon fibers are critical to manufacturing composite structures for all types of major U.S. space military and civilian programs  (e.g., satellites, space launch vehicles, spacecraft and a wide ride range of missile systems).  Key carbon fibers for these applications are unique, essential (not readily substitutable) and proprietary to a single producer/single factory in one foreign country (Japan).  This foreign, single point-of-failure source of supply, of materials critical to essentially all major high priority space programs, is vulnerable to many severe and long-lasting supply disruption risks (e.g., natural disaster, industrial accidents, future Asia conflicts, foreign government controls and higher foreign commercial market priorities.  Regarding the latter, U.S. program carbon fiber use typically represents a small fraction of total global demand.  Carbon fibers recently developed in the U.S. and commercialized for civilian applications are promising alternatives to imports.  They represent a competitive second source, a more assured supply, cost less, and reportedly perform equal to or better than imports.  Historically, U.S. government programs have relied on single foreign sourced legacy materials and funding is often not available in government programs to test and qualify alternative second sources.  FY 2016 IBAS funds will be used to test and qualify U.S. second sources of commercially available carbon fibers.  With strong cooperation from industry primes, lower tier and material suppliers -- a significant list of promising U.S. government qualification program opportunities are identified for FY 2016 execution (e.g., multiple satellites, missiles and “other” systems).  Planned IBAS projects represent low technology risks, have well defined and near-term program transition points and are low-cost relative to significant industry investments in new, domestically manufactured carbon fiber supplies.</r2:Text>

The objectives of this multiple fiscal years of effort include: analyze the MIB ecosystem (people, processes, and systems); empower the Manufacturing Industrial Base; monitor the dynamic threat environment; identify operational vulnerabilities and prevent the impact of cyber threats; and maintain resiliency and cybersecurity assurance.

Southeast Manufacturing Skills Challenge: Similar to STEM efforts such as First Robotics, the SMSC project seeks to close gaps in industrial capabilities, increase industrial base readiness, elevate the prestige of manufacturing, and identify future supply chain members by establishing a manufacturing skills challenge.  This effort across multiple fiscal years starting in FY 2017 is a collaboration between OSD and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to define and address strategic manufacturing value chain vulnerabilities and technologies, and strengthen workforce skills. This effort includes competitions with "Support for a prize”. The pilot effort will focus on welding and machining workforce in the Southeast corridor including Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and South Carolina where large ship, aerospace, and automotive growth have created workforce skills and supply chain challenges.  

Accelerator Pilot Project, continuing from FY2016, FY2017 and across multiple future fiscal years, is an effort that comprehensively addresses some of the discovery-to-transition infrastructure shortfalls, including both identifying emerging companies and increasing business viability for startup and other nascent companies focused on advanced manufacturing and application technologies. The Pilot Program will be uniquely focused on hardware and manufacturing based companies.  The comprehensive program will provide access to business strategy and development, mentors in their technology domain, DoD users, investors, and prototype manufacturing facilities.  The first cohort of six to ten startup teams in Phase 1, will encompass the following components: Curriculum and Faculty; Advisor/Mentor Network; Marketing coalition of public and private partners and sponsors; Solicitation and Selection Plan; “demo days” at the end of the program.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. 

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This project funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. 

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD CIO Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) provides for focused research, development, testing and integration of technology and technical solutions critical to the Defense Cybersecurity and Information Assurance Program to meet the requirements of 10 USC 2224 (Defense Information Assurance Program), 44 USC 3544, (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002), OMB Circular A-130, and DoD Directives/Instructions 8500, 8510, 8520, 8530, and 8540.  This program is funded under Budget activity 7, Operational System Development because it integrates technology and technical solutions to the Defense Information Assurance Program.

ISSP RDT&amp;E funds support the DoD CIO and its mission partners on architecting, engineering, and technical matters for developing governance processes and structures; on evolving and enabling a more integrated and synchronized Joint Information Environment that will leverage a single and converged joint enterprise IT platform; on the continued development of the U.S. Government’s ability to prevent and defend against adversarial and/or commercial information and communications technology supply-chain attacks on its mission critical systems, networks, and devices; on improving oversight of the life-cycle management of cybersecurity risks; and on the integration of cybersecurity standards, methods, and procedures across the DoD for a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.
Assessments of the ability of future forces to achieve objectives at the campaign level. These assessments include wargaming, qualitative, and quantitative analytic methods. They will both inform and be informed by the Support for Strategic Analysis (SSA) defense planning scenarios (DPS). They will identify risk and potential trade-space among force structure, capabilities, and readiness to inform senior leader decision-making.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY2019 funding request was reduced by 2.655 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical analysis, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects, initiatives and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space, maritime, cyberspace) of the joint information environment (JIE), to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse and secure joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  
     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the DoD Information Network (DODIN) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>IMD project supports the Department’s governance process for balancing IMD supply and demand and addressing how to modernize IMD generation.  In order to support weapons systems with intelligence data, we need to improve the modeling, simulation and assessment process for weapon systems prior to material solutions to better understand investment needs for both platforms and intelligence data. IMD is all source intelligence derived data necessary to do the following for weapon systems: to identify and counter constantly improving threat weapons and radar systems; optimize sensor design and validate sensor functionality; and support system test, evaluation and deployment.  Modern weapon systems are reliant upon increasingly voluminous and precise IMD to meet performance requirements.  This demand signal for mission support data is increasing due to requirements for both analyst-evaluated, precise data and machine-processed data to be used by weapons and control systems with increasing autonomy.  This increasing requirement is highlighting the need to have a big data/data autonomy environment to support advanced weapon systems.  In order for the community to meet modern weapons system requirements, there needs to be a measured shift with balance and attention paid to legacy and new capability needs.  There are unacceptable gaps, compounded by non-assessed program office needs and requirements that may not be obtainable; therefore, balancing supply and demand is urgently needed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In order to support weapons systems with intelligence data we need to improve the modeling, simulation and assessment process for weapon systems prior to material solutions to better understand investment needs for both platforms and intelligence data. IMD is all source intelligence derived data necessary to do the following for weapon systems: to identify and counter constantly improving threat weapons and radar systems; optimize sensor design and validate sensor functionality; and support system test, evaluation and deployment.  Modern weapon systems are reliant upon increasingly voluminous and precise IMD to meet performance requirements.  This demand signal for mission support data is increasing due to requirements for both analyst-evaluated, precise data and machine-processed data to be used by weapons and control systems with increasing autonomy.  This increasing requirement is highlighting the need to have a big data/data autonomy environment to support advanced weapon systems.  In order for the community to meet modern weapons system requirements, there needs to be a measured shift with balance and attention paid to legacy and new capability needs.  There are unacceptable gaps, compounded by non-assessed program office needs and requirements that may not be obtainable; therefore, balancing supply and demand is urgently needed.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

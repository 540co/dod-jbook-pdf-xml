                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs, investigates, evaluates, and characterizes advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, and make decisions about and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battle space focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness.

This Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in Program Element (PE) 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology). The networked sensing and data fusion efforts performed in this Project complement efforts funded in PE 0601104A / Project H50 (Network Sciences CTA) and PE 0601104A / Project J15 (Network Science and Technology Research Center International Technology Alliance).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components, both hardware and software, that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) guided missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. It focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. Project CYB designs, creates, evaluates, and applies emerging cyber techniques and cyber situational awareness technologies to enhance Army capabilities and to mitigate risks and investigates cyber collection and mapping technologies to offer real time cyber situational awareness to enable interpretation of current threats and predict future enemy activities. .

Work in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and is coordinated with PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities.

Work is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This Project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops advanced technologies for High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon systems to enable more efficient laser systems with greater power output. This includes technologies to support development of alternate laser sources, precision optical pointing and tracking components, adaptive optics to overcome laser degradation due to atmospheric effects, and thermal management systems to remove excess heat.  In addition, this effort validates laser lethality performance and conducts analyses against a variety of targets and investigates the impact of low-cost laser countermeasures.  This project includes laboratory efforts for HEL applied research as well as concepts analysis for United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Technical Center competencies in directed energy, missile defense, and space technical areas. Solid State Laser (SSL) efforts continue to leverage other funds provided by the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO), the Air Force, and the Navy to develop multiple technical approaches that reduce program risk and maintain competition.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) researches, designs, and evaluates combat and tactical vehicle automotive technologies that enable the Army to have a lighter, more survivable, more mobile and more deployable force. Project C05 investigates, researches, and evaluates advanced ground vehicle design and occupant protection technologies in such areas as armor concepts, ballistic defeat mechanisms, blast mitigation, survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), hit avoidance, kill avoidance, safety, sensors, counter-measures, instrumentation, and survivability packaging concepts to achieve superior survivability/protection for Soldiers and military ground vehicles. Survivability technologies will be designed for integration into/with the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS). Project H77 funds the National Automotive Center (NAC), which was chartered by the Secretary of the Army to conduct shared government and industry, or "dual use", technology programs to leverage commercial investments in automotive technology research and development for Army ground combat and tactical vehicle applications. Project H91 designs, matures, and evaluates a variety of innovative and enabling technologies in the areas of electrical power, thermal management, propulsion, mobility, power for advanced survivability, vehicle diagnostics, fuels, lubricants, water purification, intelligent systems, autonomy-enabled systems, and other component technologies to enhance the mobility, power and energy, and reduce the logistic chain of combat and tactical vehicles. This PE executes the Army's Combat Vehicle Prototyping (CVP) program to mature, integrate, and demonstrate ground vehicle leap ahead technologies in support of future combat vehicles.

Work in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PEs 0602105A (Materials Technology), 0602618A (Ballistics Technology, Robotics Technology), 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology), 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), 0603125A (Combating Terrorism - Technology Development), 0603734 (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), and 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).  

Work in this PE is coordinated with the United States Marine Corps, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, and other ground vehicle developers within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Departments of Energy, Commerce, and Transportation.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy in New combat vehicle, Armor, Robotics/Autonomy. 

The Ground Portfolio technology investments are creating a layered vehicle protection suite including Active Protection (Hard-Kill and Soft-Kill) capabilities supported by robust advanced armor (Enhanced Survivability). 

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM)</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies. These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with, and as appropriate leveraged by, DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality, Soldier and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Portfolios.

The work in this Project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT).  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort addresses sustainment operations by unburdening the Soldier and reducing logistics requirements (e.g., fewer batteries) for communications, computing, and sensing. The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for Soldier-portable and unattended sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted Soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution. Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of five key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, wireless power transfer, and advanced battery chemistries.  Additionally, materials and devices used for photonic applications, such as laser diodes and fiber lasers, will be studied and improved with an emphasis on overall size, weight, and power consumption efficiency gains.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) conducts applied research and investigates core night vision and electronic sensor components and software to improve the Army's capability to operate in all battlefield conditions. Technologies pursued in this PE have the potential to provide the Army with new, or enhanced, capabilities to detect and identify targets farther on the battlefield, operate in obscured conditions, maintain a higher degree of situational understanding (SU), and operate autonomously. Project H95 advances infrared (IR) sensor technologies, investigates sensor materials, designs advanced multi-function lasers for marking, targeting, designation, wind-sensing, and range finding, and develops models and simulations for validating advanced sensor technologies. Project K90 funds Congressional special interest items.

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602712A (Countermine Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), and PE 060708045 (End Item Industrial Preparedness Activities).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research and develops component technologies that enable improved Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA), and situational understanding (SU). Technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), lasers, and electronics. It also includes modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness of these technologies. Research focuses on infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track targets in all day/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in all operational environments. This Project designs, fabricates, and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational understanding, persistent surveillance, and hostile fire detection. This Project investigates and designs novel sensor electronics such as Digital Read Out Integrated Circuits (DROICs) to enable multifunction sensing. This Project also investigates and matures new semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from the periodic table. In addition, this Project develops algorithms for enhanced IR functionality, which provides the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets. The reduction of size, weight and power - Cost (SWaP-C) is a key research objective for all efforts.

                                <r2:Description>This effort develops component technology designed to increase battle space awareness, threat detection, and target identification (ID) by using a methodology of computation algorithms and optics combined with display and vision processing. The objective is to provide extended range, multi-spectral imaging capability, with reductions to the size, weight and cost (SWaC), for the individual warfighter. This effort will leverage work accomplished under Multi-Function Digital Readout Integrated Circuits (DROICs) for Cooled and Uncooled Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) to provide improved mounted and dismounted Soldier situational understanding in urban and complex terrain under low light and visibility conditions. In FY19 a portion of funding is realigned to support a new effort in Embedded Processing for Autonomous Systems to meet Chief Staff of the Army (CSA) priorities.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Soldier performance is affected by mission demands, environment, human characteristics, equipment, and technology.  System development requires considering tradeoffs among these factors and sufficient data about them on which to base analyses. This effort will identify and develop human performance measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) critical to performing individual and team tasks in a mission text. Tools and techniques for analysis of these tradeoffs will also be developed. Empirical data will be mined from existing sources or collected where gaps exist to inform the interaction among factors affecting Soldier mission performance for emerging technologies.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates and evaluates enabling tools and methodologies that support the long-term sustainment of Army training and testing activities. Specific focus is on maintaining regulatory compliance while limiting future Army liability to installation operations and training, and maintaining resilient and adaptive ranges. Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state, and local environmental/health laws and to reduce the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, technologies to empower rapid fielding of next generation energetics, propellants and munitions with focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond, and enable decision making based on accurate environmental conditions in sparse data environments.  Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution, and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations. Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling, and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions, and develops environmental sensor capabilities to enable rapid collection and analysis of data for real-time environmental situational awareness.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities for Long Range Precision Fires and Network/C3I, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

Technologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs and develops tools and methods to enable the Army to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts both in the United States and abroad. These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide. To develop the required technologies, this Project has a focus on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination, and other waste streams; a focus on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation, and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing missions; a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced, and cost effective technologies or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste; and a focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond. The resultant technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.

The work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Environment and Terrain Portfolio.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops tools and methods to enable the Army to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts both in the United States and abroad. These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military-unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes associated with contingency operations worldwide. These new and innovative technologies empower rapid fielding of next generation energetics, propellants and munitions with focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond, and deliver the capability to shape and protect Army investments in next generation fires by delivering proactive, scientifically sound risk and environmental impact management strategies. This Project will also provide integrated knowledge of environmental factors in mission planning activities creating a unified, comprehensive and integrated battlefield landscape of future threats, opportunities and impacts to mission success in sparse data environments enabling mission planners to identify the industrial/commercial resources used as components of weapons development. These resultant technologies streamline the acquisition process, enabling rapid fielding of new materials, increase Army readiness through proactive hazard management strategies for military materials, enhance the Army's ability to improve decision-making based on accurate environmental conditions in sparse data environments, and reduce Army liabilities associated with unforeseen environmental impacts.

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Military Engineering and Environmental Technology, Simulation and Computing Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy Priorities for Long Range Precision Fires, Air Missile Defense, and Network/C3I.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Project develops pollution prevention technologies required to reduce/eliminate the environmental footprint resulting from the manufacture, maintenance, use, and surveillance of Army ordnance and other weapon systems. This Project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The Project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents. 

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Environment and Terrain Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.

This Project leverages developments in wireless transport (e.g. mobile radio based communications systems) to design new techniques for improving communications in high radio frequency (RF) interference environments, such as in the presence of electronic warfare (EW), and to increase the communications capacity of terrestrial and satellite communications (SATCOM) systems. This Project also investigates antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and to reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers, such as radios and jammers. Additionally, this Project investigates defensive cyber, cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber attacks and new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. Beginning in FY19 cyber efforts are being reported in Project CY2. This Project also investigates software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and it designs spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of the congested RF spectrum. This Project also designs new technology and techniques to lower the size, weight, power and cost of networking systems deployed on Army platforms.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates and advances technologies, techniques, and tools for representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric, and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and force protection planning and operations; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities. Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and develops software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and develops materiel solutions, including rapidly emplaced bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with protective construction and critical infrastructure. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to assess non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops tactical weather and atmospheric effects/impacts algorithms for their integration into battlefield information products. Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. This Project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates, designs, and develops technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection and projection across the range of military operations.  Focus areas include force projection and maneuver, including austere port and airfield entry; prediction, definition, avoidance, or defeat of natural and manmade gaps and obstacles to support ground force operations; scalable weapons effects; and high-resolution representation of near-surface terrain and environment for use with sensor models for target detection and unmanned ground systems (UGS) navigation. This research also provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation. Work in this Project increases the protection of soldiers and critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging threats and enables maneuver support of ground forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This Project supports efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for operations in a number of environments including dismounted Soldiers conducting missions in urban and subterranean environments, distributed small units, and projection and sustainment of forces across an increasing large battlefield.      

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I), Environment and Terrain, and Soldier Portfolios.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops technologies and techniques to support robotic and autonomous operations capabilities, ensure sustainable, cost efficient, and effective facilities, and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and expeditionary operations. The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, and homeland security. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the capability of autonomous engineering during combat operations to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk/threat and dynamic environments, enables installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and on-demand expeditionary structures, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in contingency operations, including urban environments.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priority for Next Generation Combat Vehicle.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research efforts model the dynamics of electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic propagation in response to changing terrain state and complex terrain features and geometry, and their depiction in geospatial information and mission command systems. Numerical modeling of weather effects on terrain properties supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command-delivered solutions to the Soldier. The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) conducts applied behavioral and social science research to enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., unit cohesion). This PE develops new personnel measures and methods that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE develops new performance measures and metrics for individuals and units, designs innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.   

Efforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft. Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices/ procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Military Relevant Infectious Diseases, Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine, Medical Simulation and Information Sciences, and Systems Biology/Network Sciences.

Research is funded in six projects.

Project 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighters from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e., the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency. 

Project 870 designs and refines drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic assays/tests devices, other preventive measures for protection and treatment against naturally occurring infectious diseases as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.

Project 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, and life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and clinical practice guidelines to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related traumatic injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction. Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissue for the care and treatment of wounded Service Members. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Agency. 

Project ET4 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics, medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post-evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of wounded Service Members. This project is coordinated with the Defense Health Agency.

Project VB4 includes applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate biological tests and computer simulations in clinical trials and in animal studies. The PTSD and coagulopathy exemplars have demonstrated the power of an iterative systems biology approach and are moving projects related to objective diagnostics and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies. Development of the SysBioCube (a data analysis, management and integration system) has provided the ability for complex collaborative efforts to share, process, and evaluate data using innovative technologies. These concerted refinement efforts using systems biology are showing reduction of time and funding for solutions to intractable problems of critical military importance. 

Project XV5 conducts applied research on health information technologies that support combat casualty care under conditions of dispersed small-unit operations or requiring prolonged field care before evacuation. Technologies include autonomous casualty care systems and virtual health communications for Roles of Care one (combat medic and battalion aid station) through three (field hospital).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.

Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.

Work funded in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A (Medical Advanced Technology) and the Defense Health Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research to prevent and protect Warfighters from training and operational injuries, refine mechanisms for detection of physiological (human physical and biochemical function) and psychological (mental) health problems, evaluate hazards to head, neck, spine, eyes, and ears, set the standards for rapid return to duty, and determine new methods to sustain and enhance performance across the operational spectrum. This research provides medical information important to the design and operational use of military systems, and this work forms the basis for behavioral, training, pharmacological (drug actions), and nutritional interventions. 
The four main areas of study are:

(1)	Environmental Health and Protection
(2)	Physiological Health and Performance
(3)	Injury Prevention and Reduction
(4)	Psychological Health and Resilience

Additionally the Warfighter Systems Engineering Architecture task advances medical science and technology (S&amp;T) in the areas of injury prevention and performance sustainment in the context of human interaction with new Soldier systems, and provides greater insight into informing new research in developing Warfighter systems and the interactions between Warfighters and the systems they employ.
Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project MM3.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas:

(1) Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases
(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control
 
For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, Project 810.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   
 
Work in this Project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort also conducts studies to investigate new candidate vaccines for preventing malaria and selects the best candidate(s) for continued refinement.

As such, it is cost effective to let the market develop diagnostic platforms and the DoD develop the military relevant test menu of assays.  This approach was successful with the BioFire FilmArray (Next Generation Diagnostic System).  While a dedicated diagnostic capability will be eliminated within the Military Infectious Diseases Research Program, many of the existing task areas have the knowledge and proficiency to develop diagnostic assays.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

Combat casualty care research addresses control of severe bleeding, resuscitation and stabilization, predictive indicators and decision support technologies for life support systems, treatment of burns, and traumatic injuries to hard and soft tissues of the face, mouth, and extremities and traumatic brain injury (TBI). 
This project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication.
Research conducted in this project focuses on Combat Casualty Care Research in the following four areas:

(1)	Damage Control Resuscitation
(2)	Combat Trauma Therapies
(3)	Combat Critical Care Engineering
 (4)	Traumatic Brain Injury

All drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.
Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under Program Element (PE) 0603002A, Project 840.
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio, TX, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post-evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of traumatic injury. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. Research involves extensive collaboration with multiple academic institutions to refine treatments for combat wounds through Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM). This Project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication. Research conducted in this Project focuses on Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.

All drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under Program Element (PE) 0603002A, Project ET5.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this Project is performed by United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio, TX; and the AFIRM, at Multiple Institutions across the United States.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports biological and clinical applied research using the data analysis and integration grid (SysBioCube) as an overarching means of complex data usage to solve critical health problems. The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is the integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, using global multi-omic methods to identify and discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions (physiologic, immunologic, endocrine, etc.), supporting transition of research to clinical applications. This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement as seen in biomarker development for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and enhanced analyses of coagulopathy. Another application of systems biology is to characterize physiological pathways altered by toxic substances enabling identification of the causative toxic substances as well as to understand the injury mechanisms. The detection/identification of physiological markers of exposure to toxic substances can then be used to support medical countermeasure decisions or development of targeted therapeutic drugs.

These examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to Projects studying biological systems (PTSD) Project have been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Applied research is being conducted to identify biological networks that are causative of illness in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and co-morbidities (presence of one or more diseases or disorders), coagulopathy (impaired ability to clot blood) of trauma, Traumatic Brain Injury, pain, suicide, infectious disease, and immune responses. In particular, the studies of PTSD are directed to refine biomarkers for screening, early diagnosis and therapeutic target discovery.</r2:Description>

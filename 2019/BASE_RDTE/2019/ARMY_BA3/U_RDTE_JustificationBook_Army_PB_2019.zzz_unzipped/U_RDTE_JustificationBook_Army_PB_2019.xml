                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates equipment and innovative techniques for precision aerial delivery of cargo and personnel. Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.

Efforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier Portfolio.

Work in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).
 
The cited work is consistent with the S&amp;T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures, demonstrates, and integrates lightweight and multifunctional materials and components to provide the Soldier and small units with the most effective protection and mobility systems. This Project also invests in understanding the trade-offs of integrating state-of-the-art technology with Soldiers' personal protection, electronics connectivity, power and energy, user interfaces and display content, and other mission specific equipment that seeks to reduce physical weight, cognitive burden, and sustainment needs of the small unit. This Project develops, matures, and maintains a Soldier Systems Engineering Architecture (SSEA) framework that represents human factors consideration in development of major Army platforms. Efforts in this Project focus on integrating and demonstrating system-level personal protection, durable Soldier protective clothing and individual equipment, environmental threats, and power management solutions. In addition, special focus is on understanding and demonstrating the impacts of physical and cognitive load on Soldier mission performance by implementing strategies to reduce load and/or optimize loads to reduce injuries, and the creation of user interfaces that mitigate the impact of increasing technologies and sensors worn and carried by Soldiers. These efforts integrate geographically dispersed laboratory environments to conduct comprehensive assessments and report the technical viability of Soldier system solutions and conducts field demonstrations to obtain relevant feedback for user acceptance and performance validation. This Project also matures and demonstrates mission command and power and energy technologies for the dismounted Soldier and small unit operating in a networked operating environment.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates mission-specific plug and play components, subsystems, and modules designed to optimize manpower requirements, improve situational awareness, increase Soldier readiness and survivability, improve habitation, reduce logistics footprint, enhance supportability, and reduce cost. Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers, which are rapidly deployable/re-locatable, require no Military Construction, and need limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and assesses the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under Program Element (PE) 0602786A/Project VT4. Demonstrated EBC equipment is transitioned to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).

Efforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier Portfolio.

Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology). 

The cited work is consistent with the S&amp;T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

In FY19, this project merges into XW6, Small Unit Expeditionary Maneuver, along with 242	, Airdrop Equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In project MM3 there are two title changes in FY19.  The Physiological (human physical and biochemical functions) Health and Environmental Protection (Sleep Research/ Environmental Monitoring) title changes to Physiological Health and the Environmental Health and Protection - Physiological (human physical and biochemical functions) Awareness Tools and Warrior Sustainment in Extreme Environments title changes to Environmental Health &amp; Protection.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced medical technologies including drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic devices, measures for identification and vector control, and developing medical practices and procedures to effectively protect and improve the survivability of United States Forces across the entire spectrum of military operations. Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.

Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for human medical products, and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides). The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small group human study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct safety and effectiveness clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large pivotal trials in diverse populations will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and small safety and effectiveness studies involving humans according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA or EPA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.

Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.

Project 810 matures and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and medical procedures and practice guidelines intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin, muscle, nerve, vascular and bone tissues in wounded Service Members . Additionally, this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events, determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces, and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces. 

Project ET5 conducts validation studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics, medical devices, procedures, and rehabilitative strategies intended to minimize long-term effects from battlefield injuries. This project supports advancing technology supporting clinical and rehabilitative solutions to restore function of ocular and visual system post injury; and advancing regenerative techniques to restore the function and appearance of damaged tissues by regenerating skin, muscle, nerve, vascular and bone tissues in wounded Service Members.

Project FH4 matures, validates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies), validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors. 

Project MM3 supports the Medical and Survivability technology areas with laboratory validation studies and field demonstrations of biomedical products designed to counteract myriad environmental and physiological stressors, as well as materiel hazards encountered in training and operational environments to protect, sustain, and enhance Soldier performance. The key efforts are to demonstrate and transition technologies, as well as validate tools associated with Soldier survivability, injury assessment and prediction, assessments for post-concussive syndrome, and enhancing performance during continuous operations. The three main thrust areas are
(1) Physiological Health and Environmental Protection, (2) Injury Prevention and Reduction, and (3) Psychological Health and Resilience. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services. 
Work funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0602787A and the Defense Health Program.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD; US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Ft Detrick, MD; US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; US Army Institute of Surgical Research, Joint Base San Antonio, TX; United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Ft Rucker, AL; the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD; US Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Joint Base San Antonio, TX.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project maturates and demonstrates United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic (identification of the nature and cause of a particular disease) systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases that are threats to deployed United States military forces. The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Research conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:

(1)	Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases
(2)	Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3)	Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4)	Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control

Research is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under Program Element 0603807A, Project 808.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Efforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort selects promising anti-parasitic drug candidates for treating malaria and leishmaniasis for testing in humans, prepares data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans. Studies have shown that the malaria parasite can become resistant to existing drugs, which makes it necessary to continually develop new and more effective and safe treatments. This effort selects candidate vaccines for various types of malaria, including the severe form of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (Plasmodium vivax), prepares technical data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans and conducts testing of promising malaria vaccine candidates in humans. A malaria vaccine would minimize the progression and impact of drug resistance and eliminate the need to take preventive anti-malarial drugs.</r2:Description>

As such, it is cost effective to let the market develop diagnostic platforms and the DoD develop the military relevant test menu of assays.  This approach was successful with the BioFire FilmArray (Next Generation Diagnostic System).  While a dedicated diagnostic capability will be eliminated within the Military Infectious Diseases Research Program, many of the existing task areas have the knowledge and proficiency to develop diagnostic assays.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

The effort continues to improve and mature a variety of integrated unitary and submunition system concepts to mitigate the gap that will emerge with the loss of cluster munitions. Concepts such as a unitary projectile geared towards medium armor targets, a full bore submunition with a highly reliable triple function fuze, a concept that increases the size and fuze volume of the Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) bomblet and incorporates high reliability fuzing while maintaining the traditional lethal mechanisms of DPICM. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the efforts optimize the concept of bomblet/system design and component space allocation to accommodate system level development and demonstrating concept performance through modeling and simulation. Efforts mature system level designs of unitary solutions and improve initial system level performance. Efforts continue to mature designs and exploit alternate technologies to mitigate risk; develop evaluation criteria to assess concept performance; integrate component technologies into system level solution that are effective against target sets.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates advanced technologies for future High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons technology.  The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  SSL technology has demonstrated the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). 
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA's) future capability opportunities for leap-ahead technology for directed energy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort matures and integrates devices to protect occupant's eyes, vehicle cameras, and electro-optic fire control systems against anti-sensor laser devices as well as reduces the sensor's optical signature. Anti-sensor laser devices can deny vision either temporarily by flooding the sensor with too much light (jamming) or permanently by damaging the sensor. These jamming or damaging effects can slow our battle tempo, disrupt fire control solutions, or prevent vehicles from completing their mission. This effort focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of optical systems that protect sensors and Warfighter vision from pulsed, continuous wave and future laser threats to maintain fire control capability and situational awareness.

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance / Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test/evaluation.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates technologies to enable Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) including sensor technologies, perception hardware and software, and control technologies that allow the Soldier to perform mission tasks more efficiently. Challenges addressed include: obstacle avoidance, overcoming perception limitations, intelligent situational behaviors, command and control by Soldier operators, frequency of human intervention, operations in adverse weather, and autonomy enabled vehicles protecting themselves and their surroundings from intruders. Mature technologies are incorporated onto existing, Army-owned UGV technology demonstrators so that performance of the enabling technologies can be evaluated.  

The approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office.

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy in Robotics/Autonomy..  Ground Portfolio investments are greatly improving logistics throughput and surge capability supporting maneuver forces (Leader-Follower technology) and allow experimentation with manned and unmanned teams to develop the advantages that inform/protect the maneuver force (Robotic Wingman JCTD)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and validates applied behavioral and social science technologies that enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., unit cohesion). These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, assignment methods, and performance metrics for individuals and units, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Work in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Efforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.

Work in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602785A (Manpower/Personnel/Training Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates a distributed modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment that integrates a collection of multi-fidelity models and simulations and tools that map to an evolving architecture and M&amp;S activities to support decisions throughout the acquisition life-cycle. This provides a unifying M&amp;S architecture that synchronizes and integrates multi-resolution modeling applications such as Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) experimentation.  This effort focuses on researching cutting-edge M&amp;S methods to enable the Army and the Department of Defense (DoD) to perform critical System of Systems (SoS) analysis, experimentation, technology tradeoffs, capability assessments, concept development, and training that saves time and resources while increasing the effectiveness of acquisition and training activities.  

Efforts in this Project support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the S&amp;T priorities of the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) demonstrates and evaluates emerging technologies and systems with high payoff potential to address current technology shortfalls or future capability gaps. Efforts include: hybrid electric power technologies to reduce use of fossil fuel in tactical generators; collaboration with the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy to demonstrate technologies that provide significant gains in ground vehicle energy efficiency; demonstration of ground platform power management, generation, and distribution technologies that increase energy efficiencies and support the integration of advanced future capabilities; and field demonstrations and red teaming activities to stress and assess emerging technologies earlier in the systems development life-cycle, thus reducing potential vulnerabilities and providing an improved understanding of employment risks against potential threats.

Work in this PE is complementary to and is fully coordinated with PE 0602618A/Project H80 (Ballistics Technology/Survivability and Lethality Technology),  PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), and 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Design and conduct a series of virtual scenario-based exercises, rooted in stakeholder input on emerging threats and areas of overmatch concern, with participants from government, academia, and industry who represent red (threat), blue (US forces), and green (influence base, neutrals) perspectives in order to expose assumptions, characterize needed capabilities, and identify current and future critical vulnerabilities.  Exercises cover broader time and space conditions than are possible in live field experiments. Implement team challenge experiments to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks for developing concepts or systems; and, based on previous year evaluations, modify analysis methodologies, structured assessments, and frameworks to improve data captured for analysis and feedback, with the goal of providing insight and data to enable risk mitigation, informing current or future acquisition programs early in the development lifecycle. Potential technical areas of interest will include force protection, interoperability, internet of things, autonomous systems, and electronic warfare.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates electronic warfare (EW) sensors and software intended to deny, disrupt, locate or destroy the enemy's command, control and communications (C3) systems and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. This PE matures both countermeasures (CM) and counter-countermeasures (CCM) to deny the enemy the use of their systems while protecting United States (U.S.) assets from enemy deception and jamming. Project CY3 matures and demonstrates architecture, sensor and software techniques to provide operationally relevant capabilities for cyber support at Corps level and below and enables cyber situational awareness, command and control, mission rehearsal, observable reporting, and framework to incrementally advance cyber tool development. Project K15 matures and demonstrates capabilities to locate and exploit enemy communication systems including computer networks. Project K16 matures and demonstrates multifunctional EW capabilities (jamming) to enhance platform survivability and provide near real-time situational awareness to the Commander through the detection, identification and geo-location of emitters of interest.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) addresses the supercomputing requirements of Department of Defense (DoD) scientists and engineers by: (1) demonstrating and maturing the most advanced, leading-edge computational architectures while exploiting the resulting systems by employing complementary specialized expertise; (2) demonstrating and maturing the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), which investigates, demonstrates, and matures leading-edge digital networking and security technologies to securely deliver computational capabilities to the distributed DoD Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) community; and (3) leveraging specialized expertise from DoD, other federal departments and agencies, industry, and academia to demonstrate and mature leading-edge software application codes. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive computational capabilities to demonstrate and mature emerging technologies that address the supercomputing requirements of the DoD RDTE community in the areas of hardware, software, and programming environments. All HPCMP sites are interconnected to each other, the DoD High Performance Computing (HPC) RDTE community, and other major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which investigates, demonstrates, and matures (a) state-of-the-art digital networking technologies to ensure a robust distributed environment and (b) the most advanced digital security capabilities to protect the intellectual property of the DoD and its contract entities as they employ HPCMP capabilities. The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.

Work in this Program Element (PE) supports the Army Science and Technology Environment and Terrain Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Will continue to mature multi-disciplinary software technology in support of current and future defense programs. For aeronautical systems of all types (i.e., fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, munitions, missiles, rockets, etc.), this endeavor will continue maturing model-centric conceptual design software technology to support pre Milestone-A Defense acquisition processes, enabling application of physics-based analysis of alternatives, technology trade-space exploration, and cost implications. For fixed-wing aircraft, this will include, but will not be limited to, high-fidelity physics-based analysis capabilities for coupled aerodynamics, structural dynamics, propulsion, and flight controls in support of flight certifications (e.g., air worthiness, store carriage and release, etc.), mission planning for fielded and new systems and associated upgrades, and acquisition decisions associated with exploration and design analysis of future manned and unmanned aerial vehicle concepts. Additionally, it will include implementation of foundational software improvements necessary to begin development of physics-based design analysis tools for future hypersonic weapon systems (High Speed Strike, Tactical Boost-Glide, and Manned/Unmanned Conventional Prompt Global Strike). For rotorcraft, exemplars will include aeromechanics analysis associated with maneuvers, airframe-propulsion system integration, and weapons carriage and release, as well as infrared suppression analysis, chaff trajectory prediction, debris ingestion analysis, and loads prediction capability necessary for structural airworthiness assessments. These capabilities will be deployed in support of the FVL Program, as well as for sustainment of existing rotorcraft-based programs and associated upgrades, such as the ITEP. For RF antenna design analysis, will further mature computational electromagnetics capabilities to assist in design and evaluation of next generation radar for aircraft, ships, and ground-based platforms; will demonstrate capability for assessment of electromagnetic hazards on ordnance and will optimize computational methods for electronic warfare assessments and evaluation of multiple antenna systems on a single platform. For Naval Ships (surface and submarine), will further mature conceptual and early modeling capabilities in sync with detailed design and analyses, to realize full-lifecycle management of systems and platforms, and for conducting AoAs.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments). Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day/night/adverse weather conditions. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                <r2:Description>This effort provides uncooled infrared (UCIR) sensor technologies to improve survivability through increased Situational Awareness (SA) in all conditions and environments, to include Degraded Visual Environments (DVE), for manned and unmanned ground vehicle systems. Current uncooled IR requires improvement in sensitivity and development of signal processing techniques to penetrate obscurants. Integration of improved sensors, signal processing algorithms, and data fusion will maintain mission capabilities in DVE (e.g. smoke, dust, fog). Demonstration of scalable, multi-functional (360 degree SA, Hostile Fire Detection (HFD), Aided Driving), low cost SA systems with in-vehicle displays that can be tailored to the ground platform and mission requirements will bring timely and useful information to the vehicle crew and squad. This is a Joint effort with the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) under PE 0602601/Project C05 and PE 0603005/Project 221.

This project assists Army installations and operations in achieving environmental compliance. Army facilities are subject to fines and facility shutdowns for violations of federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Efforts under this Project enable the Army to reduce environmental constraints at installations while complying with the myriad of federal, state, local, and host country environmental regulations and policy. In addition, this project matures capabilities to assess, establish, upgrade, and construct infrastructure to project power and enable deployed force operations. Current and planned efforts enable the Army to perform additive and advanced manufacturing for deployed force infrastructure, support robotic and autonomous engineering during combat operations, and ensure infrastructure resiliency. Technologies demonstrated aim to reduce the cost of resolving compliance issues for the Army, sustain the viability of testing and training ranges, protect critical resources, and expand capacity to perform construction and supporting tasks in high risk/threat and dynamic environments.

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Military Engineering and Environmental Technology, Simulation and Computing Portfolio.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates technologies transitioned from Program Element (PE) 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology), Projects 835 and 896 by addressing the management and mitigation of materials and chemicals with focus on impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond; shape and protect Army investments in next generation fires by delivering proactive scientifically sound risk and environmental impact management strategies; environmental factors in mission planning activities impacting the battlefield landscape of future threats; and opportunities and impacts to mission success in sparse data environments, enabling mission planners to identify the industrial/commercial resources used as components of weapons development. Technologies matured within this Project inform the Army of potential environmental threats, opportunities and impact to mission; to understand the environmental threat in urban and industrial contested environments; and rapidly sense and assess the presence and extent of dangerous compounds in battlefield environments. A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies. Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with myriad federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water. This Project includes pilot scale field studies to demonstrate technological feasibility and optimize performance and productivity of the risk mitigation techniques.

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Military Engineering and Environmental Technology, Simulation and Computing Portfolio. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priority for Network/C3I, Air Missile Defense, and Long Range Precision Fires, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates software and architectures for geospatial mapping applications and decision aids for the Warfighter. Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops and critical fixed and semi-fixed assets. Protection measures support force projection in areas such as air and sea ports of debarkation, dispersed small units, and units operating in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations and future vertical lift. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. 

Force protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating in disbursed small units over complex and urban terrain and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blast and weapon effects from advanced and emerging threats. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply and manned-unmanned teaming and demonstrates infrastructure health monitoring assessment technologies to support emerging projection challenges in complex, contested environments such as distributed sustainment over large distances. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for "upfront engineering" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization priorities for Next Generation Combat Vehicle, Air Missile Defense, Network/C3I, and Future Vertical Lift. This work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832/Project D8Z.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates technologies to address the integrated tactical communications challenge with distributed, secure, mobile, wireless, and self-organizing communications networks and networked transceivers that must operate reliably in diverse and complex terrains and environments. Efforts demonstrate seamlessly integrated communications and information security technologies across all network tiers, ranging from unattended networks and sensors, through maneuver elements using airborne and space assets. Project EL4 matures and integrates antennas, wireless networking devices, protocols, and software; network operations tools and techniques; and combines these with current fielded networks and systems in a series of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) network modernization demonstrations to measure their technology readiness levels and assess them against currently fielded network architectures in an operationally relevant environment. Project EL5 matures information security devices, techniques, services, software and algorithms to protect tactical wired and wireless networks against modern network attacks; generates and distributes tactical cyber situational awareness; and focuses on configuration, operation, monitoring, defense and network reconstitution in bandwidth constrained tactical environments while reducing the operator workload required to conduct these functions.

Work in this PE complements PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology) and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priorities.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates key communications and mobile networking technologies, such as antennas, transceivers, transceiver components, networking software and novel techniques to provide secure, reliable, mobile network solutions that function in complex and diverse terrains. This project concentrates on four major goals: to provide a series of technology demonstrations of new and emerging command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) technology enabled capabilities to significantly reduce risk associated with the network-of-networks concept; to lower the size, weight, power and cost of wireless networking systems deployed on Army platforms through hardware and software convergence; to provide critical improvements in the ability to communicate and move large amounts of information in radio frequency (RF) contested environments, in a seamless, integrated manner across the Army's highly mobile manned and unmanned force structure; and to assess the technology readiness level (TRL) of emerging network technologies in an operationally relevant environment. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Priority for Network/Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The yearly themes for the integrated capabilities event are determined by the maturity of the tech base programs across the Army S&amp;T command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I) portfolio. On an annual basis, those programs at or approaching TRL 6 will be solicited for participation based on their maturity to enter TRA in the FBRR environment located at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB-MDL) (Fort Dix).

                                        <r2:Text>Will develop a framework to support a common federated identity and access management solution for the Command Post computing environment by coupling next generation non Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based wearable multi-factor authentication and access control technologies with authorization techniques; will demonstrate access control improvements through removal of hardware focused identification methods (such as card based tokens) and instantiation of virtualized identifications with associated management and distribution solutions for tactical environments; will mature application services (hashing, labeling, and integrity) to capture the lineage of tactical information flows as they traverse the network; will mature data provenance techniques to enable trusted messages between producers and consumers through methods such as concealed file history; will mature an enhanced reprogrammable miniaturized encryption module for tactical handhelds and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors/devices optimized for low power and low cost requirements to enable integration into smaller footprint platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles  and dismount Soldier systems; will optimize a framework incorporating machine learning algorithms to capture data, model, understand, and dynamically tailor user experience and software vulnerability analysis results based on evidence collected; and provide a plug-in to enable rapid insertion of new software assurance methods through automated incorporation and application of the methods to existing software and firmware.</r2:Text>

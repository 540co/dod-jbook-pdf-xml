                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DCMA utilizes an agile incremental approach for system development, modernization, and sustainment allowing the DCMA to deploy needed systems and major business process changes. Through major initiatives like the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) modernization, Integrated Workflow Management System (IWMS), and Talent Management System (TMS) the DCMA will reduce risk, improve performance, and enhance the competency of the acquisition workforce. These systems support the DCMA congressionally-mandated emerging missions focused on mission assurance and commercial item pricing.  Furthermore, we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment by achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture, and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY17 the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) will focus on the conceptual design of a modernized MOCAS Technical Architecture to further drive efficiencies in how the Agencies perform their Contract Administration and Contract Pay missions. The current MOCAS technical environment aligns with 1960s techniques and is limiting our development choices while stifling innovation. While some of the underlying MOCAS system technology has been upgraded (most recently in the 1980s), the fundamental architecture has not been updated. The approach for performing architecture and technology upgrades for the MOCAS system is complicated and will require multiple initiatives (Business Process Reengineering (BPR), Organizational Change Management (OCM) , prototyping and technical evaluations) working together to maintain business functionality as we enhance the system. These initiatives include upgrading the user interface to a modern interactive web experience, establishing configurable workflows and business rules in the system, updating the persistent data storage technologies in use, and augmenting the reporting and system interfaces to enhance interoperability within the DoD. Additionally and in parallel, the MOCAS JPMO will move from design to development on three major/complex System Change Requests (SCRs), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 850/860 recycle, Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID), and Single Line of Accounting (SLOA) with projected implementation late FY 2017/ mid FY 2018 and late FY 2018 respectively. The need for these system changes is driven not only by our internal stakeholders and customers, but also by directives and policies received from various regulatory sources such as the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO); Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L); Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP); and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)/FAR. Appropriate investment is required to implement these changes that will help the DoD move closer to achieving key goals for improving financial controls and audit trails that promote end-to-end funds traceability, compliance with data standards, and adoption of modern technologies to improve interoperability across the DoDs Procure-to Pay mission.

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCMA is invigorating efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  In pursuing these business practices, we are continuing to utilize both government full time equivalents and contractors to perform specialized functions such as software development, testing, and process automation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>To deliver on our mission and vision, the Agency is focused on four primary goals:  1) inform and contribute to cost control and affordability decisions; 2) develop agile business practices which optimize mission execution and support to the acquisition enterprise; 3) create and maintain an agile learning organization and culture that strives to exceed customer expectations; and 4) expect of ourselves what we expect of our contractors:  good fiscal stewardship.  All four of the strategic goals go directly to the heart of the DCMA mission.  The Agency helps our partners spend their finite dollars wisely, ultimately ensuring the front line Warfighters get the equipment and services they need when they need them.  Adherence to executing and ultimately attaining these goals will posture DCMA to positively support current and future Better Buying Power initiatives and initiatives in Services acquisition, innovative science and technology, and efforts to ensure greater acquisition affordability, and better cost control throughout the acquisition life cycle. Agency focus will not solely rest on qualitative contract administration functions, but will also focus on quantitative factors as well – those factors that will clearly emphasize the Agency’s return on investment (ROI) to the Department and to our other customers and the taxpayers at large.The Agency recognizes the obligation to be effective stewards of the funds we receive. In 2016, DCMA's return on investment to the Department and our other customers was $2 for each $1 invested by DoD. Additional ROI for the Department is the expanded and expanding DCMA commercial pricing expertise that will continue to improve DoD buying power, the Services' lethality, operational readiness, and sustainment posture.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

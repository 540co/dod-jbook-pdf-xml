The DMOC training capabilities reach 31 geographically separated Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology and capability studies\/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution by:\n \n1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability\/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various systems, tools, and simulators to incorporate ever-changing technology and emerging training requirements into DMO events, such as Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (CVF), to enhance the quality of warfighter training.  Activities include Environment Generator development, DMO Tool Development, and Simulator Enhancement.  DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Warfare Center-Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS).  The NGTS is the primary environment generator for both Blue and Red Air in DMOC White Force.  DMO Tool development includes: a)  DMOC Replay Tool (DRT) facilitates a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events;  b) enhancement & improvement of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Filter and the Doctor-J (Dr. J) tools to enable tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between disparate simulator and operationally fielded (i.e. live aircraft) communication formats;  c) Development of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)\/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) to improve damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises; and d) development of solutions for integrating Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events; and simulator enhancement efforts to incorporate Mission Package standards upgrades into the Control and Reporting Center (CRC) Simulation Package (CSP) to allow a real-world system to be used as a simulator when needed in DMO events.\n\n2. Assessment & Authorization (A&A)\/Software Certification:  The DMOC supports cybersecurity requirements definition, integration\/test support, analysis, systems engineering support, A&A of core systems, and support software certification.  The DMOC implements cybersecurity requirements and is working towards the application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include Cross-Domain Information Sharing \/ Multi-national Information Sharing (CDIS\/MNIS) ruleset development, load sharing, and testing; integration and testing of various newly developed \/ updated systems such as the DMOC Replay Tool, Dr. J, DIS Filter, and the DMOC Battlespace; and support of Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) software certification.\n\n3. Distributed Training Sites & Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates up to 30 geographically separated LVC training locations and 50+ systems into LSB DMO training events such as VF and CVF by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into LSB DMO events each year based on higher headquarters and Combatant Commander's (CCDRs) emerging requirements.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $1.940 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

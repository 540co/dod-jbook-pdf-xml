            "val": "Digital Modular Radio (DMR) with Integrated Waveform (IW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable hardware is the Navy's technical solution for the IW\/MUOS requirement. The DMR AN\/USC-61(C), is the first software defined radio to have become a communications system standard for the U.S. Military. The compact, multi-channel DMR provides multiple waveforms and multi-level information security for voice and data communications. DMR radios currently operate aboard U.S. Navy surface and subsurface vessels, fixed-sites and other Department of Defense communication platforms using frequencies ranging from 2 MHz to 2 GHz. Certified to pass secure voice and data at Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) over High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) channels, the DMR system was developed to the U.S. Navy's specifications and meets all the stringent environmental, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and performance requirements for use in the U.S. Fleet. This task is for the continued development\/integration of the IW and MUOS waveforms into the DMR in accordance with Military Standards 188-181,2,3, and the High Frequency Distribution Amplifier Group (HFDAG). IW uses a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) communication system in an attempt to improve satellite bandwidth utilization over legacy SATCOM waveforms. This enables demand assigned services on UHF SATCOM networks to support new applications that require better performance and higher channel throughput. The MUOS waveform will enable MUOS satellites to provide worldwide communication satellite coverage for DoD requirements. MUOS will provide functionality comparable to commercial mobile phone systems. HFDAG is a follow-on HF solution to fulfill the HF communication capability from 2MHz - 30MHz (transmit) and 2MHz - 30MHz (receive) with ALE, Link 11, FSK, USB, LSB and ISB modes of operation for Navy Modernization Process (NMP) and platforms. HFDAG will utilize the existing DMR as the exciter\/receiver. \n\nThe budget in FY18 provides funding to complete Integrated Waveform (IW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) integration and testing as well as finishing the software development of the DMR High Frequency Amplifier Link Establishment (HF ALE) GEN3 which will determine the most reliable HF frequencies to achieve faster and more dependable linking."

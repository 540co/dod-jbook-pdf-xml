This effort also includes collapsing existing CAMIS IT systems to unique, non-standard processes that remain which include the Cadet Honor System, discipline and accountability, advanced admission, and a replacement for the Cadet Logistics and Supply System (CLASS).  The largest component expected to require development includes re-designing the data warehouse to enable Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) analytic software.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies to a more sustainable and flexible services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD executes the development of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cloud services as part of the Data Center Optimization Initiative, as well as future HR application requirements which are beyond the scope of AFIPPS.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This PE supports the design, development, and improvement of components used for aerial delivery of personnel and cargo (Project 283 Airdrop Adv Tech), combat clothing and personal equipment including protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear (Project H98 Clothing & Equipm Tech), combat rations and combat feeding equipment (Project H99 Joint Service Combat Feeding Technology), expeditionary base camps (Project VT4 Expeditionary Mobile Base Camp Technology), small unit expeditionary maneuver technologies (Project XW5 Small Unit Expeditionary Maneuver Technology). This PE supports the investigation and advancement of critical knowledge and understanding of Soldier physical and cognitive performance. Project E01 Warfighter Technology Initiatives funds Congressional special interest items. The Projects in this PE adhere to Tri-Service Agreements on clothing, textiles, and food with coordination provided through the Cross Service Warfighter Equipment Board, the Soldier and Squad Integrated Concepts Development Team, and the Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board.\n\nWork in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602787A (Medical Technology), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology), 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priorities and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

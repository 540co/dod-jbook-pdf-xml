This capabilities will enable integration of the Cyber Mission Force (CMF) with the regional and local cyber network defense elements. These tools will provide cutting edge hardware and software, integrated with existing infrastructure and tools to facilitate active Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO). Cyber Tool Development will include data analytics solutions to enable the ability to correlate and analyze the massive amount of data coming across the network and provide timely situational awareness. It will also include development, integration, and testing of Defensive Cyber Tools and infrastructure that will facilitate pushing cyber sensor data to the data analytics engine as well as support remote access to prevent or react to a cyber incident. Defensive Cyber Tool Development includes creation of developmental environments for emerging commercial tool assessment as well as Army Cyber Soldier development of tools. Additionally, this program element supports the development of a Cyber Mission Planning tool that is an application-based, scalable, secure warfighting system to support cyberspace operations mission planning and command. The Mission Planning tool helps identify Cyberspace Key Terrain (KT-C) and determines probable attack vectors; and produces a set of relevant internal defense measures, triggers, and decision points.\n\nThis program element will support the start of several DCO programs beginning in FY19 and supports material solutions for the October 2016 Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)  approved  Defensive Cyberspace Operations Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD). The hardware and software capabilities enable Army Cyber defense forces to protect, search and discover, maneuver and engage, and mitigate and respond to enemy cyberspace operations. DCO programs will allow near real-time employment of defensive measures that will allow friendly cyber forces to maintain advantage. These programs directly support US Cyber Command Integrated Priority List #2 Produce Advanced Cyberspace Infrastructure and #5 Defensive Forces to execute passive and active defense operations at net-speed."

System designs focus on open architecture and open source capabilities. Development focuses on implementation of a modular design to maximize innovation through continuous releases. Modules will be refined by industry as a component through adoption of prototypes. Each program will have a prime integrator (single contractor) that integrates the new modules. The Government will assess and create prototypes of new modules under the Consortium for Command, Control, Communications and Computer Technologies (C5) Other Transactional Agreement contract vehicle. Monthly technical interchange discussions with C5 members will occur to insure new technologies are inserted as soon as possible and will lead to semiannual fielding decisions for new modules.\n\n The overall strategy of the Tactical DCO Infrastructure program is to develop the software infrastructure and deployment scripts that provide a solution that is physically and\/or logically converged with the Army's Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) to minimize the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements in a Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Tactical Command Post (TCP). The capability will provide pre-positioned infrastructure at echelons Battalion through Corps that enables global, regional, and local cyberspace defenders to conduct DCO mission planning and protection measures. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of Government entities and commercial vendors."

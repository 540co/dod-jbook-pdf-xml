Kill Chain Automation applies new methodologies; advances automation and machine learning; ensures data is accessible, agreeable, and interoperable; and delivers decision advantage.\n\n(U\/\/FOUO) Algorithmic Warfare encompasses efforts to develop, employ, or field artificial intelligence, automation, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms. This critical shift to the digital age will transition ISR analysis from the \"what\" to the \"why\" of analysis via human-machine teaming. Algorithmic Warfare can provide world-class ISR support to Joint Operations at the scale and speed required in modern warfare against our adversaries. \n\n(U\/\/FOUO) Algorithmic Warfare reshapes current sense, identify, attribute, share (SIAS, previously known as PED - processing, exploitation, and dissemination) models because the current models will be unsustainable and ineffective in developing ISR digital solutions to find efficiencies and thrive in a complex operating environment. This funding is a first step to address ISR analysts' struggles with data overload; they currently spend 80 percent of their time searching for data and 20 percent of their time making sense of the information. \n\n(U) Supports National Defense Strategy priority of operating at the \"speed of relevance.\"\n\n(U) Supports Next Generation ISR Dominance Flight Plan.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

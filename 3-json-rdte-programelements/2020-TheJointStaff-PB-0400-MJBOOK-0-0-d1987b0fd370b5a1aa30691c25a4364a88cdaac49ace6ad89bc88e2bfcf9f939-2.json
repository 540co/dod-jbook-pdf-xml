JIAMDO is the operational community\u2019s proponent for requirements and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD\u2019s resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads IAMD mission and utility analysis, integrates IAMD within the force protection joint capability area, conducts evaluations, demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures, and provides advocacy for innovative, technically mature, and affordable solutions.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the United States. JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the development of the IAMD prioritized capabilities list and the global integrated IAMD assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System.  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and technical oversight of homeland capability solutions."

In coordination with Services and CCMDs, JIAMDO Core funds the definition, assessment, development, and approval of Joint IAMD operational concepts, operational architectures, and capability requirements. These assessments guide the Department's joint, interagency, integrated and net-centric IAMD. JIAMDO Core provides funding to:\n\n1. Conduct and integrate joint studies, simulations, war games, force resource allocation, and interoperability initiatives.\n\n2. Manage relevant Congressional interaction and CCMD interface through a cadre of liaisons collocated with major headquarters.\n\n3. Directly support and sponsor homeland air surveillance-related demonstration and analysis activities.\n\n4. Manage the IAMD Working Group and co-chair the Protection Functional Capabilities Board focusing CCMD, Joint Staff, and Service collaboration efforts to generate joint concepts and develop the IAMD architecture and roadmap.\n\nJIAMDO Core enables strategic planning development, security, travel, and other support activities.  Funding pays for: contracted Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) support for Air & Cruise Missile Defense (ACMD), Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Homeland Air Security (HAS) strategic planning, studies & analysis, combat ID, modeling & simulation.

JIAMDO is the IAMD proponent for requirements and capabilities within the DoD\u2019s resource allocation system. JIAMDO leads IAMD mission and utility analysis, integrates IAMD within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations of joint IAMD architectures. \n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to coordinate integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the United States. JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs. At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM development of IAMD prioritized capabilities list and the global integrated IAMD assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and homeland defense solutions."

As part of the Joint Staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to IAMD issues. JIAMDO is the IAMD proponent for requirements and capabilities within the DoD\u2019s resource allocation system. JIAMDO leads IAMD mission and utility analysis, integrates IAMD within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations of joint IAMD architectures. \n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to coordinate integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the United States. JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs. At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM development of IAMD prioritized capabilities list and the global integrated IAMD assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and homeland defense solutions."

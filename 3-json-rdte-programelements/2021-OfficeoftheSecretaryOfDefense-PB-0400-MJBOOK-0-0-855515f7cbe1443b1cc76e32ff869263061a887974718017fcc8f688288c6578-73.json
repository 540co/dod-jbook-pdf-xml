Deputy Director, Engineering (DD, Eng) oversees, initiates, and recommends opportunities to align technology investments to accelerate capability delivery, or modifying existing systems.  This program supports:\n\n(1) Reforming the Department for greater performance and affordability by maintaining visibility into major programs and conducting independent technical risk assessments (ITRAs) to advise the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) and Milestone Decision Authorities on progress towards achieving key performance parameters, technology maturation, interoperability, and cyber security posture;\n(2) Modernizing key capabilities and mission priorities through technical support for mission engineering and establishing budget priorities; and\n(3) Cultivates workforce talent by both developing engineering methods, policies, processes, and tools that are cross cutting technologies and integrating technical disciplines to advance DoD engineering practices and providing advocacy and oversight for the Department's engineering workforce to build a capable, current, and innovative engineering workforce. \n\nIn FY 2019, this PE began activities to carry out responsibilities described in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 855 titled Mission Integration Management (MIM).\n\nIn FY 2020, funding from Project Code 143, Program Protection, was re-aligned to a new Maintaining Technology Advantage Program Element (PE) 0605797D8Z, to support efforts which have transitioned to the Deputy Director, Strategic Technology Protection and Exploitation (STP&E).\n\nBeginning in FY 2021, DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO) funding, Engineering Resilient Systems (ERS), and Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) activities aligned with the national defense modernization priorities and transitioned from Engineering Science and Technology (PE 0603833D8Z) to Systems Engineering (PE 0605142D8Z).

The Department of Defense (DoD) must address cybersecurity and supply chain risks to DoD networks, weapons systems, and information stored and processed on both DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified contractor information networks that support DoD programs.  Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drives the need for diligent program protection planning and execution.  Program Protection Planning (PPP) includes protection of classified and unclassified controlled technical information, critical program information, critical components, and critical mission functions, and integrates high-level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition and S&T practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor information networks; improve mitigation and management of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify and protect Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of DoD Instruction 8582.01 Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems for Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks.\n\nDD, STP&E provides independent assessments of research, technology and defense acquisition program\u2019s system security engineering and program protection implementation.\n\nThe DD, STP&E reviews and approves the PPP for each Major Defense Acquisition Program, and monitors and reviews the system security engineering planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  \n\nThis PE includes efforts by the office of the DD, STP&E in implementing the Department\u2019s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of the DD, STP&E systems engineering and technical reviews. \n\nIn FY 2020, funding from this project will transfer to the Maintaining Technology Advantage PE 0605797D8Z, in alignment with the DD, STP&E mission."

The activities conducted through this PE will provide engineering analysis at the mission, campaign, and engagement levels to support the prioritization of the Department\u2019s modernization initiatives.  This systematic enterprise approach will support the realization of mission capability by assessing the joint mission gaps and capability solutions against anticipated adversaries in relevant operational environments.  Mission engineering will support development of an analytically sound set of decisions resulting in a more rigorous technical assessment against technical priorities.  The PE will support establishment of multiple mission architectures and further support and align investment opportunities in order to take advantage of tech surprise opportunities, maintain a tactical edge, insert technology, improve interoperability and formulate long-term strategies to retain or improve our capabilities against our adversaries.

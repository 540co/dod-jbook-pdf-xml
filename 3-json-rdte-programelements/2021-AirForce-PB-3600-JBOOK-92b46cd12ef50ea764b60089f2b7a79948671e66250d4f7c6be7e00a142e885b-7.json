            "val": "This effort develops propulsion and power technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary aerospace technology capabilities. The effort has six projects, each focusing on a technology area critical to the Air Force. The Advanced Propulsion Technology project develops high-speed air breathing propulsion engines to include combined cycle, ramjet, and hypersonic scramjet technologies to enable revolutionary propulsion capability for the Air Force. The Combustion and Mechanical Systems project develops engine mechanical system technologies: bearings, seals, drives, and lubricants as well as combustion components, concepts, and technologies for legacy and advanced turbine engines. The Turbine Engine Technology project develops enabling capabilities to enhance performance and affordability of existing weapon systems and develops component technologies for ultra high pressure ratio, substantially improved durability, and adaptive cycle engine architecture to provide optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and life for widely varying mission needs. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops electrical power and thermal control technologies for military applications that remove operational limitations and enable advanced vehicle designs and high-power mission systems. The Rocket Propulsion Technology project develops advances in rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, missiles, the sustainment of strategic systems, and tactical rockets. The Aerospace Fuel Technology project evaluates hydrocarbon-based fuels for legacy and advanced turbine engines, scramjets, pulse detonation, and combined-cycle engines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, the Aerospace Systems RDT&E Budget Activity 02 (BA02) efforts and activities under PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, and PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, are realigned and consolidated into PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of internal Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate operations to finalize the 2012 merger of the Air Vehicles Directorate and Propulsion Directorate; and to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and the Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.\n\nAll transfers detailed below are administrative realignments for consolidation, and not new starts. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located either in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH or Edwards Air Force Base, CA.  \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology, is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 623048, Combustion & Mechanical Systems is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 624847 , Rocket Propulsion Technology, is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technology.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 623012, Advanced Propulsion Technology is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 622405, High Speed Systems Technology. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

This project develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides both optimized performance and fuel efficiency for widely varying mission needs. This project supports joint Department of Defense, agency, and industry efforts to focus turbine propulsion technology on national needs. The project plan is relevant across capability areas for global responsive strike, tactical and global mobility, responsive space lift, and persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 623066, Turbine Engine Technology in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Develop technologies to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD). Technologies under this project enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Tasks include: modeling and simulation; proof of concept tests of critical components; advanced component development; and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance tasks could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause. All thrusts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) collaboration and are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and progress towards RP21 Goals.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technology is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technologies in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Applications include missiles, aircraft, sustained high-speed vehicles, and responsive space launch. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include evaluations of fuel properties and characteristics of alternative fuels developed from unconventional sources (such as coal, natural gas, biomass, and combinations thereof), unique\/alternate fuels and components used in integrated thermal and energy management systems including high heat sink fuel capability, fuels logistics and associated vulnerabilities, and combustion diagnostics and engine emissions measurements.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology was transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

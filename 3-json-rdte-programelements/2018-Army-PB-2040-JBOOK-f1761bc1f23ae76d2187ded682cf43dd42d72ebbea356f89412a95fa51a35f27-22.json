            "val": "The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy. The CATT program portfolio directly supports the Army's Training Strategy and progressive training model by providing realistic training events and comprehensive After Action Reviews (AAR). CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and AAR for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) supports combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment. Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.\n\nFY 2018 core funding of $.937 million for CCTT enables gaming technology and visualization for maneuver training, and the P3I for the CCTT in order to reduce life cycle costs.\n\nFY 2018 base funding of $0.536 million will continue program management activities in conducting market research for future Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of GFT flagship replacement.\n\nFY 2018 base funding of $11.513 million will continue the efforts of providing development of the capability to produce common terrain databases to maintain concurrency with supported training systems. FY 2018 funds will continue modifying the Terrain Development process for constructive terrain databases, and continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture. Base funding also provides continuous development of new OneSAF capabilities for virtual simulations and enables interoperability with the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE); this is a cost avoidance for individual virtual simulators in that they do not develop and maintain separate Semi-Automated Forces (SAFs). SE Core will continue to upgrade, integrate and refine the Common Virtual Components, and continue to develop common visual models and transportation networks.\n  \nFY 2018 base funding of $5.580 million for AVCATT will design and develop software to inter-operate with other training devices and simulators in a Common Operating Environment (COE).  This is required to enable training with the Universal Mission Simulator, CCTT, Games For Training, and LVC-IA.  Additionally, the base funding will be used to design and develop the replacement of the Image Generator system as part of hardware modernization."

SE Core's mission is to ensure the Army's training systems and simulators are integrated and interoperable in support of U.S. Army Readiness. SE Core provides virtual simulators with visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic to Force 2025 and beyond.  The result is a \"Fair Fight\" capability; no simulator or operator will have an inherent advantage over another.  Fair Fight allows for air and ground to have coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations.  Additionally, SE Core is building the Army's Common Virtual Environment (CVE) that provides the linkage between simulators and establishes a common environment for interoperability, allowing various simulators to be linked together for a train-as-we-fight capability. SE Core is a foundational element in the Integrated Training Environment linking the embedded systems, multi-mode Live, Virtual, Constructive, Gaming (LVCG) training capability with current systems.\n\nThe SE Core components are Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) integration; terrain database generation; common visual models; virtual systems architecture; a dynamic environment; and mission command development. A major SE Core component is the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC) process used to generate the synthetic terrain used in simulators and simulations. This terrain is a key component for virtual simulators and constructive simulations and will meet the demands of today's and future simulations.\n\nFY17 base funding request decreased significantly from the PB16 submission due to a de-scoping of program requirements.\n\nFY 2018 base funding of $11.513 million will continue the development of the terrain generation capability for common terrain databases to maintain concurrency with supported training systems. FY 2018 funds will continue developing the terrain generation tools and process for constructive terrain databases, and continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture. Base funding also provides continuous development of new OneSAF capabilities for virtual simulations and enables interoperability with the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE); this is a cost avoidance for individual virtual simulators in that they do not develop and maintain separate Semi-Automated Forces (SAFs). SE Core will continue to upgrade, integrate and refine the Common Virtual Components, and continue to develop common visual models and transportation networks. Base funding will also begin development of new tools and processes needed to support the Dense Urban Terrain environment requirement."

The AVCATT also supports the training of Non-Rated crew members in crew coordination, flight, aerial gunnery, hoist, and slingload related tasks via the Non-Rated Crew Member Manned Module (NCM3); which can be linked to AVCATT's UH-60, CH-47, and UH-72 cockpit configurations to support a unit's specific Mission Training Requirements.   \n\nFY2018 base funding for AVCATT will design and develop software to inter-operate with other training devices and simulators in a Common Operating Environment (COE).  This is required to enable training with the Universal Mission Simulator, CCTT, Games For Training, and LVC-IA.  Additionally, the base funding will be used to design and develop the replacement of the Image Generator system as part of hardware modernization."

The most recently awarded RDTE effort was on the fourth delivery order, awarded in September 2014, which included options for gunnery enhancements, integrated data modem development, training environment virtualization, aviation mission planning software development, maintenance tool kit development, manned unmanned teaming, and AH-64E concurrency development.\n\nThe government awarded a single award, CPFF, IDIQ services contract to Cole Engineering Services, Inc, a small business, in September 2015.  The period of performance of the base contract is through September 2020.   The third task order, awarded in June 2016, included hardware modernization development and Windows 10 research and testing.   \n\nAVCATT utilizes small business competitively awarded contract vehicles when able. Currently small businesses are conducting development for dynamic terrain enhancements, NCM3 development, and training effectiveness analysis.\n\nThe AVCATT program is post Milestone C. Although the system is in the production phase, continuous research, development, testing, and engineering is required in order to maintain concurrency with the real world aircraft and systems that the AVCATT simulates in the virtual training environment. The AVCATT program has fielded the full base order of issue of 23 suites but continues to release incremental hardware and software upgrades at approximate semiannual intervals."

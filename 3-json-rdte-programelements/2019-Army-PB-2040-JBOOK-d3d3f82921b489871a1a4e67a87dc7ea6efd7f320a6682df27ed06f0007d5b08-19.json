            "val": "This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of ECPs that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle. The current M88A2 is not capable of Single Vehicle Recovery of the M1A2 SEPv2 in all situations and the M1A2 SEPv3 fielding in FY 2020 will further exacerbate the recovery problem.\n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nM113 improvements will develop an affordable solution for upgrading the M113s to enhance protection, survivability, mobility and power generation to support the current and future network systems.  This will provide the necessary enhancements to the M113 capability for Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) units with priority to the forward deployed units and equipment sets.  The Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program will replace all M113 family of vehicles in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT).\n\nStryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD ONS effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Improved Target Acquisitions System (ITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY2020.\n\nLight Armored Vehicle improvement program will design, test and modify two Light Armored Vehicles (LAV-25A2s) for Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) to inform operational concepts for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in support of Global Response Force early entry operations.  This will directly support the expeditionary maneuver excursion that will be conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps in FY17-18."

The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles.  Currently, the M88A2 is unable to safely perform Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of the Abrams tank in all conditions, due to added weight\/survivability improvements made to the tank. In order to ensure SVR is met, Project Director- Main Battle Tank Systems (PD-MBTS) will develop and integrate technologies for the M88A2 HERCULES through an Operations and Support (O&S) initiative to meet its operational requirements of SVR throughout its life cycle. This initiative is not intended to exceed current operational capability, but will instead regain SVR capability of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.\n\nTechnical assessments and analyses will be used to evaluate design solutions to meet SVR, and inform key program decision points. The goal of the assessments  will be to provide confidence to Army Leadership that a M88A2 HERCULES solution is affordable, achievable, and feasible using existing technology with manageable risk. Limited analyses, conducted to date, suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, hydraulics, engine, transmission and other related components are required.\n\nFY 2019 Base dollars will be used to continue the development of SVR ECP, initiate fabrication of vehicle prototypes, and continue the development of the transmission upgrade ECP (the longest developmental item)."

The strategy for Abrams will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future. This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY2011.\n\nThe Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development, and technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank and technologies in support of any validated Army requirement."

To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army existing programs of record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while the Bradley A4 ECP improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army program of records, including continued SINCGARS integration and Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P). The Bradley A4 development effort led to a production decision in FY 2017. The Bradley M2A4\/M7A4 Vehicle is the combination of the M2A3\/M7A3 Base Vehicle with ECP 1 and ECP 2 components installed and integrated.  Additionally, a follow on Engineering Change Proposal to the Bradley A4 ECP, Bradley A5 ECP (Lethality) integrates Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) to replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability along with other technology upgrades and insertions (i.e. laser pointing, color camera, laser range finder, etc). Product Manager Bradley will characterize a Non Developmental Item (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. A separate integration effort began in FY 2018 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats."

DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD ONS effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Improved Target Acquisitions System (ITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY2020."

In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II was approved continuing design and integration of ECP 1 mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades, and the in-vehicle network upgrades.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP 1 efforts on the DVH platform and defer efforts on flat-bottom Strykers.  The effort has subsequently been renamed the Stryker DVH A1 ECP.  The DVH A1 ECP Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The initial DVH A1 ECP production contract was awarded in October 2016 (Sole-Source Firm Fixed Price arrangement).  A second buy of DVH A1 ECP vehicles was awarded in October 2017 (Fixed Price Incentive Fee arrangement).\n\nOn July 2, 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker 30mm ICVD Operational Needs Statement (ONS) effort.  30mm ICVD Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development\/Test Support were awarded in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The 30mm ICVD ONS Production\/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.\n\nThe Stryker Lethality ECP efforts will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon system, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J), common masted sensor, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the Stryker CROWS-J ECP and ATGM ECP efforts was received in a September 30, 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM)."

                            "val": "Guardian Angel (GA) is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization program.  GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing\/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.\n\nFunds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR), Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Recovery, Oxygen Systems, Medical Monitoring, Aerial Insertion, Information Management (including Preservation of the Force and Family (POTFF) Tracking System), and the Battlefield Air Operations Kit. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes and associated engineering support to posture the GA program for technology insertion. The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, requirements development and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions,to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Guardian Angel weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.\n.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

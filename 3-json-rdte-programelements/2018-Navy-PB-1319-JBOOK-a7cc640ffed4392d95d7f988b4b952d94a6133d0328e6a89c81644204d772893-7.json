            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan which is developed from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.  \n\nThis PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities. Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the CNO and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. \n\nThis PE also includes the Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG) International Science Program whose mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet\/Forces (F\/F), and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission is the Naval Science Advisor Program that develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon tour completion, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first-hand knowledge of the F\/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. This program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems. The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios."

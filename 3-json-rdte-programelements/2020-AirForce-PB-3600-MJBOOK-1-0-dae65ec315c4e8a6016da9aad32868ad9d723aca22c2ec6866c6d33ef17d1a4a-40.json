ESS will meet the requirements for strategic communications and capability gaps identified in the Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the Protected Follow-on for Resiliency (PAFR) Study and the Strategic Tiger Team,  The ESS architecture and functionality will be designed in accordance with the United States Strategic Command's signed ESS Concept of Operations and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's validated Capability Development Document (CDD) satisfying the legacy AEHF strategic requirements and mission performance with enhancements for increased resiliency and cybersecurity.\n\nESS will support strategic mission requirements such as Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC), Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) strategic networks, terminal report back, and Emergency Action Message (EAM) dissemination. The program will provide the National Command Authority (NCA) and Combatant Commanders with highly-reliable, secure Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) to execute the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), and command and control strategic forces at all levels of conflict. ESS will support the forecasted 2030 strategic demand in all operational environments (nuclear, contested, and benign) and will be compatible with the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform. The ESS system will also satisfy emerging requirements and capabilities for enhanced resilience by accommodating on-board resilience payload(s) and incorporating improved resiliency and cybersecurity features.\n\nFor more rapid and resilient strategic capability risk reduction, the ESS Program Office is developing an acquisition strategy that leverages Section 804 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 for rapid prototyping and rapid fielding to the greatest extent practical, while maintaining the continuity of the AEHF strategic mission that interfaces operationally within the existing Nuclear, Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) architecture.  \n\nActivities for the ESS ground segment acquisition includes evolving and enhancing existing ground segment, space-to-ground segment integration, and modernization in support of Enterprise Ground Services compatibility, in accordance with the approved acquisition strategy and schedule. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ESS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The Air Force plans to utilize FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act Section 804 (Public Law 114-92) Rapid Prototyping Authority for ESS. A rapid prototyping phase effectively replaces the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase from a traditional acquisition under Department of Defense 5000 series Directives and Instructions. This approach allows up to three contractors to focus on reducing space segment risks with the objective of maximizing ESS demonstrated capability for a XDR-processed payload and other key technologies. An ESS Program Office-led RFP and source selection will eventually determine which space prototyping contractor, via their performance during the rapid prototyping phase, is best positioned for the follow-on contract award. The space prototyping contractors will be carried through the follow-on source selection to continue momentum until the follow-on contract is awarded.\n\nReturn on investment from space prototyping will energize the industrial base and increase competition in strategic SATCOM; inject innovative technical, process and integration approaches; burn down risk early and identify\/correct issues as early as possible; and decrease traditional fielding timelines to support a more resilient and responsive architecture against emerging threats. Success in the competitive rapid-prototyping determines and informs follow-on fielding."

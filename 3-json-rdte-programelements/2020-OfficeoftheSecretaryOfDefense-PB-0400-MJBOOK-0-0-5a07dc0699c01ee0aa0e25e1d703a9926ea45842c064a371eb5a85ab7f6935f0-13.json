The analysis uses the operational context of Joint and cross-domain missions by leveraging Combatant Commands (COCOM) and Joint Staff warfighting concepts. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the COCOM.\n\nAnalysis and assessments are focused on challenges related to the National Defense Strategy objectives and adversary research and development trends.  Three analysis methods are used: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assess counter technology options, and provide an operational value assessment; and 3) the Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing analytic assessments can span fiscal years and may have multiple phases."

Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. The emerging nature of the problem sets makes specific identification of all the study projects beyond the budget year unlikely.\nImplementation of this process spans multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year-to-year.\n\nOperational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2020-2040 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development. Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-\tKCA across Defense Planning Scenarios and other relevant DoD Vignette to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace.\n-\tDevelop and maintain an all source-like database of military capabilities and a standalone software application, KCA Results Display System, to provide data and analysis on operational issues.\n-\tProduce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.\n-\tConsolidate Technology focused roadmaps of U.S. capability development and S&T developmental strategic plans.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC\/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD\/DoE) laboratories. Using these research performers, previously sponsored research on relevant topics is leveraged in the new research providing value and experience on new projects. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-\tTechnical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.\n-\tQuantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies.\n-\tArchitecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability.\n-\tIndependent assessment of critical capability and technology development.\n\nAnalytic Tools include modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A), computer based engineering models, and purposed designed equipment to demonstrate or confirm theoretical performance of technical concepts. Main lines of effort include the following activities:\n-\tDevelop analytic tools to inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.\n-\tDevelop strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.\n-\tIntegrated MS&A leveraging Service- and Agency\u2013level virtual and constructive resources to provide insight into complex acquisition and operational decisions.\n-\tRed Teaming existing and planned U.S. capabilities and weapons systems using emerging threat systems and capabilities in emerging scenarios."

These short studies typically focus on the following capability areas: foreign, integrated air and missile defense capabilities; options for U.S. electronic warfare and capability to counter adversaries; resiliency in U.S. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and options to counter adversaries C4ISR capabilities; ground combat offensive and defensive capabilities, air dominance and missile defense, and undersea engagements.

Products scheduled to be delivered in FY18 include Army Cyberspace Analysis; Space Superiority Analysis of Alternatives and Cost -Benefit Analysis updates: Overhead Persistence Infrared (OPIR) Analysis; Assessment of Hostile use of Space Force Enhancement; and Position Navigation Timing (PNT) analysis.  Support TAA 21-25 Resourcing Phase and commence TAA 22-26 Capability Demand Analysis Phase.  TAA is a phased force structure analysis process that defines the required Army force structure within end strength and accounts for the military and DA Civilian requirements and authorizations necessary to comply with DOD guidance.  Participate in the Army's FDU process 19-2 and 20-1. FDUs Include capabilities development, capabilities determination, requirements approval, and implementation decisions.  Additionally during the TAA cycle new Rules of Allocation (ROA) will be developed to ensure SRC40 units are properly accounted for in the future POM force."

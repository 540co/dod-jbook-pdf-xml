There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).\n\nThe DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. \n\nThe Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.\n\nThe DoDIN Systems Engineering and Support project performs discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technologies through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to fill capability shortfalls and technology gaps across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).   The OCTO identifies these gaps\/shortfalls, pursues leading innovative solutions from industry, academia, and the Federal sector, and engages industry partners for commercial best practices.  The OCTO Develops technology forecasts and innovation roadmaps for existing and nascent DISA Programs in the following areas:  Process\/Automation, Cloud, Cyber Security, End-User Devices, Communication (DoDIN\/Mobile\/End-User Devices).   The OCTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services.  The OCTO performs early identification of technology needs and explores, develops, and delivers recommended emerging technologies to the DISA Requirements & Analysis Office."

The decrease is attributed to the termination in research efforts of the Service Level Interoperability of Tactical Edge Core (SLITEC).  Decrease is also attributable to technology maturing at such a rapid pace, it is imperative to rapidly assess, integrate, and transition promising technologies and capabilities.  To improve efficiency and effectiveness of these processes, the assessment framework will be streamlined to reduce the timelines, resource requirements, and fiscal requirements.  Capability prototypes will be delivered more rapidly through the use of Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs) and\/or Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), and joint assessment initiatives and partnerships will be coordinated. These improvements are expected to yield an estimated cost savings in FY 2018."

CTO will conduct technical assessments for future cloud computing technologies and innovative service delivery models, mobile devices, application development and vetting best practices, and next generation virtualized Software Defined Networks (SDN) for automating and virtualizing the DODIN.   CTO will partner with commercial partners, academia, technical analysis centers, as well as organizations within the Intelligence Community, to bring state of the art capabilities to the DISA\/DoD resulting in better communications and monitoring tools, enterprise services and improved end-user services and capabilities.  CTO will continue to pursue and refine methods, processes and strategies to assist in the acceleration of capability into the operational environment.                  \n\nThere is a decrease of -$1.644 from FY 2017 to FY 2018. The FY 2017 funding will be used to morph to an internet 2.0 environment where DoD, other government organizations, coalition members, first responders, private industry, academia and commercial vendors will be able to share secured data and information in such a way that adversaries can be identified, found, brought to Justice before inflicting harm on innocent citizens and allies anywhere in the world.  CTO will aggressively pursue next generation technologies to feed the internet 2.0 environment.  These technologies will be leveraged through the expansion of a CTO futuristic Skunk Works effort known as Software Defined Everything (SDE) which is based on the notion of using software to keep redefining itself, rather than being locked into operating in a specific way.  It is easily reconfigurable and extensible software that rapidly morphs to adapt to newly emerging situations.  SDE will serve as an enabler for the internet 2.0 environment. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of -$0.276 is attributed to the Service Requirements Review Board (SSRB) contract reduction."

Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts."

The DoD, AF, and the Cyber Mission Force require an interconnected and interoperable cyber infrastructure to conduct integrated planning and execution of cyberspace operations. Unified Platform delivers this capability through the integration of disparate, Service-specific platforms and systems, infrastructure, mission capabilities, data analytics, and programs to build interoperable and scalable network for cyber capabilities. A common, Unified Platform allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision and operational superiority, the key to successful cyber operations within the highly dynamic cyberspace domain. \n\nUnified Platform rapid prototyping efforts integrate Service-specific cyber capabilities and explore novel cyber technologies culminating in an initial Unified Platform capability (e.g. minimum viable product). The rapidly evolving cyberspace domain requires flexibility in which rapid prototyping activities inform the initial Unified Platform capability baseline through the early stages of technology maturation and delivery. Rapid prototyping efforts are executed in an operational development environment to expedite development and evaluation of cyber capabilities within relevant warfighter timelines and are transitioned to Foundational Efforts (BA 7, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 672281 Foundational Efforts) once included in the Unified Platform baseline. \n\nThe Secretary of the Air Force leads the Unified Platform effort as Executive Agent on behalf of the Department of Defense. Unified Platform directly supports the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for  Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), USCYBERCOM operational directives, the latest MAJCOM Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unified Platform weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Salient to this mission area, rapid prototyping activities provide the structure to rapidly develop, evaluate, and integrate new cyber capabilities and inform the initial Unified Platform capability baseline during the early stages of technology maturation and delivery.  Air Force Prototyping efforts support this need through rapid and exploratory research, prototype development, risk reduction, testing, and integration of cyber capabilities contributing to early operational development of the Unified Platform capability baseline.  The USAF in conjunction with the Services and National Agencies execute operationally focused research and development and rapid prototyping to explore and determine validity of potential infrastructure, architectures, and capabilities\/tools to support Cyber Mission Forces.  These rapid prototyping efforts will be tailored for near-immediate integration into the Unified Platform baseline (BA 7, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, BPAC 672281 Foundational Efforts) for delivery to cyber warfighters.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unified Platform weapon system capability.

In order to match the speed of need of the highly dynamic cyberspace domain, the Service-agnostic Unified Platform capability implements an agile development framework to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities to remain responsive to evolving warfighter requirements.  The Unified Platform program executes the agile development requirements provided by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and USCYBERCOM stakeholders in accordance with the prioritization provided by the multi-Service Unified Platform governance structure.\n\nThe initial Unified Platform capability will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for immediate deployment and operational use by the Cyber Mission Force.  Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver enhanced capabilities, incrementally building the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter needs and requirements to achieve cyberspace dominance.  Early development of the Unified Platform baseline capability relies on extensive rapid prototyping efforts to analyze integration constraints and opportunities of Service-specific cyber capabilities to realize the Unified Platform MVP and inform the future Unified Platform baseline (BA 4, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 646504 AF Prototyping and 646505 USCYBERCOM Prototyping).  In parallel, an enduring foundational Unified Platform thrust area supports the development and maturation of Unified Platform baseline, integrates successful prototyping activities, and implements an agile development\/security\/operations (DevSecOps) construct to rapidly evolve and enhance the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter requirements (BA 7, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 672281 Foundational Efforts).\n\nThe Unified Platform program office utilizes Concept, Development, Risk management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to agile acquisition planning.  All plans contain sufficient information to inform acquisition decisions (i.e., authorities to proceed), within the agile framework, to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process.  Unified Platform will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a new Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that can meet many requirements related to Unified Platform.  These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA); they require a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies."

Salient to this mission area, rapid prototyping activities provide the structure to rapidly develop, evaluate, and integrate new cyber capabilities and inform the initial Unified Platform capability baseline during the early stages of technology maturation and delivery.  USCYBERCOM Prototyping efforts support this need through the focus on the rapid and exploratory research, prototype development, risk reduction, testing, and integration of cyber capabilities contributing to early operational development of the Unified Platform capability baseline.  USCYBERCOM in conjunction with the Services and National Agencies execute operationally focused research and development and rapid prototyping to explore and determine validity of potential infrastructure, architectures, and capabilities\/tools to support Cyber Mission Forces.  These rapid prototyping efforts will be tailored for near-immediate integration into the Unified Platform baseline (BA 7, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, BPAC 672281F Foundational Efforts) for delivery to cyber warfighters.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unified Platform weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F"

In order to match the speed of need of the highly dynamic cyberspace domain, the Service-agnostic Unified Platform capability implements a scaled agile development framework (SAFe) to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities to remain responsive to evolving warfighter requirements.  The Unified Platform program executes the agile development requirements provided by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and USCYBERCOM stakeholders in accordance with the prioritization provided by the multi-Service Unified Platform governance structure.\n\nThe initial Unified Platform capability will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for immediate deployment and operational use by the Cyber Mission Force.  Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver enhanced capabilities, incrementally building the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter needs and requirements to achieve cyberspace dominance.  Early development of the Unified Platform baseline capability relies on extensive rapid prototyping efforts to analyze integration constraints and opportunities of Service-specific cyber capabilities to realize the Unified Platform MVP and inform the future Unified Platform baseline (BA 4, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 646504 AF Prototyping and 646505 USCYBERCOM Prototyping).  In parallel, an enduring foundational Unified Platform thrust area supports the development and maturation of Unified Platform baseline, integrates successful prototyping activities, and implements an agile development\/security\/operations (DevSecOps) construct to rapidly evolve and enhance the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter requirements (BA 7, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 672281 Foundational Efforts).\n\nThe Unified Platform program office utilizes Concept, Development, Risk management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to agile acquisition planning.  All plans contain sufficient information to inform acquisition decisions (i.e., authorities to proceed), within the agile framework, to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process.  Unified Platform will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a new Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that can meet many requirements related to Unified Platform.  These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA); they require a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies."

TTP addresses the gap between initial technology or concept development and demonstration, and successful acquisition and operational capability implementation. Experimentation explores new concepts and their applications in potential future operating environments within a system-of-systems context. Prototyping enables integration and demonstration of emerging technologies as a bridge between the laboratory and the warfighter. TTP allows acquisition program managers (the capability developers) and warfighters (the capability recipients and end users) to prototype, integrate, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment in partnership with Program Executive Officers (PEO), schoolhouses, simulation facilities, and development planning organizations.\n\nFor FY18, Project 645350, Transition Prioritization was re-named Experimentation to better describe the efforts in the project.\nFor FY18, Project 645351, Advanced Engine Development was re-named Prototyping to better describe the efforts in the project.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

                            "val": "The Experimentation project funds experimentation campaigns to explore new concepts and their applications in potential future operating environments within a system-of-systems context. Concepts and enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, directed energy weapons and multi-domain operations hold great promise, yet their transition to acquisition programs and fielded capabilities is typically hampered due to uncertainties regarding their military application and organizational implications. Implementing successful transition approaches for complex and widely applicable concepts requires a comprehensive and coordinated campaign of learning. Experimentation campaigns enable organizational learning through the methodical and systematic application of experimentation and supporting analysis. Experimentation campaigns are centered on an operational level warfighting concept to provide context for assessment, and use wargaming, simulation, and field experimentation to evolve, refine, and validate the warfighting concept leading to solid, evidentiary-based materiel and non-materiel capability development approaches with associated recommendations. Experimentation campaigns improve the effectiveness of operations by developing concepts and generating new information to address challenging threats of the future which aids the fielding of advanced technologies by providing the credible evidence decision makers need to make sound strategic decisions and investment choices. Experimentation campaigns are directed by the Air Force Capability Development Council to ensure funding supports the highest Air Force priorities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Tech Transition weapon system capability.\n\nFor FY18, Project 645350, Transition Prioritization was re-named Experimentation to better describe the efforts in the project."

Integration and demonstration of prototypes also allows leadership to make informed strategy and resource decisions based on the results of such prototype demonstrations. In addition to the current prototyping effort under the AETP effort, future prototyping efforts funded from this Project will aim to capitalize on various emerging warfighter technology areas (e.g. hypersonics, directed energy weapons).\n\nPrototyping enables a key linkage between research and development in the lab and fielding advanced technologies to the warfighter. Under Project 645351, AETP will serve as a model prototyping effort to reestablish the Air Force's experimentation and prototyping culture. Adaptive engine technology combines fuel efficiency characteristics of high-bypass turbofan engines used by commercial airliners with high performance characteristics of military fighter engines. AETP is maturing fuel-efficient, adaptive-cycle engine technologies and demonstrating flight-weight, prototype adaptive engines. The engine architecture has undergone initial technology development and proof of concept work via the Air Force Research Laboratory\u2019s Adaptive Versatile Engine Technology program (ADVENT) and the Adaptive Engine Technology Development program (AETD). As such, the technology is now ready for transition to a prototyping effort under AETP.  In like manner, Project 645351 plans to support other prototyping efforts in the future, enabling similar emerging technology transitions.\n\nFor FY18, Project 645351, Advanced Engine Development was re-named Prototyping to better describe the efforts in this Project."

Additional bypass air increases fuel efficiency at cruise conditions, increasing range and decreasing tanker demand, while providing additional cooling air for thermal management of onboard electronics. Additional core air produces greater thrust required for higher energy conditions necessary for military fighters (acceleration, supersonic flight). AETP will also mature new materials and component technology which can be individually transitioned to existing legacy platforms.\n\nAETP will design and manufacture multiple flight-weight adaptive engine prototypes, complete component rig assessments, characterize materials, and inform manufacturing process improvements. By producing flight-weight prototypes, the program will demonstrate adaptive engine technology can be scaled to meet military fighter engine size requirements, while ensuring appropriate manufacturing- and technology-readiness levels. By performing sea-level, altitude, and durability assessments across multiple power settings, the prototype engines will demonstrate fuel efficiency increases, thrust increases, and new component technologies. These assessments will provide data to quantify the capability and reduce risk in areas such as thermal capacity, reliability, and supportability, among others.\n\nAETP has been initiated to reduce lead-time and technology risk for next-generation adaptive engine systems through technology maturation and risk reduction activities. The program is not specific to any one platform; rather, it is aimed at reducing risk in preparation for revolutionary, next-generation propulsion systems for multiple combat aircraft applications. AETP will increase acquisition agility by enabling varying degrees of technology insertion across multiple platforms."

This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department.  SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve the science and engineering workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with the academic research community and international partners.\n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative, a Department of Defense basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), funded in partnership with Air Force and Navy University Research Initiatives, and executed by the Office of Naval Research and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation\u2019s only social science basic research programs in support of national security.  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise."

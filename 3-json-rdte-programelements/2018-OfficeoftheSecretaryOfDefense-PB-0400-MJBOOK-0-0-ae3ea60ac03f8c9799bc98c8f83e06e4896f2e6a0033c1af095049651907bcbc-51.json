The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) funding fulfills the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities, netcentric\/JIE communications which comply to standards for interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems as well as the mission functionality that uses these systems. Also, these funds underwrite assessment of design and procurement and execution correction of critical information systems from initial definition through development to successfully delivered configurations. Funds provide expertise supporting technical oversight of design, performance and cost parameters of key Defense IT and National Security Systems and supporting infrastructure including critical cyber assessments. Resources in this program fund architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3, non-intelligence space, and cyber activities. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, architectures, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation."

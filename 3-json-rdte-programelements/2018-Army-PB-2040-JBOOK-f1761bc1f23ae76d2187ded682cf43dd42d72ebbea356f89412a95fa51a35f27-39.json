IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts.\n\nIn FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. IGSSR-C received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was approved on 5 December 2016 by the MDA, which approved plans to leverage a Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia delivery order to develop, integrate and test the Initial Capability (IC).  No production activities are planned for FY 2018. Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E), Tactical Security System (TSS) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies."

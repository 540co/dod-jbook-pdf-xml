            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary advances in turbine, advanced-cycle, rocket, and space propulsion as well as electrical power, thermal management, and fuels.  The program has six projects, each focusing on technologies with a high potential to enhance the performance of existing and future Air Force weapon systems.  The Aerospace Fuels project develops and demonstrates improved hydrocarbon fuels and advanced propulsion systems, including those for air-breathing, high-speed\/hypersonic flight.  The Aerospace Power Technology project develops and demonstrates adaptive power and thermal management components, controls, and systems for high-power payloads and aircraft as part of energy-optimized aircraft development.  The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project develops demonstrator engines by integrating the engine cores demonstrated in the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with low-pressure components.   The Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion project develops and demonstrates innovative rocket propulsion technologies, propellants, and manufacturing techniques.  The Advanced Aerospace Propulsion project develops the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for in-flight demonstration and for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket based).  The Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project develops and demonstrates core turbine engine technologies for current and future aircraft propulsion systems.\n\nPortions of the Aerospace Fuels, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration, and Advanced Turbine Gas Generator  projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nProjects in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, the efforts and activities under Project 632480, Aerospace Fuels, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology, in order to consolidate Aerospace Fuel research for increased transparency for Congress.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633035, Aerospace Power Technology; Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion; Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, and Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platforms Dev\/Demo.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 634921, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Int, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Int, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platforms Dev\/Demo.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in either Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio or Edwards Air Force Base, California. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

The advanced fuel emphasis is on demonstrating new thermally stable, high-heat sink, and controlled chemically reacting fuels for a conventional turbine engine, turbine-based combined cycle engines, and other advanced propulsion systems. The project also evaluates and demonstrates fuel system components that minimize cost, reduce maintenance, and improve performance of future aerospace systems. The advanced propulsion emphasis is on demonstrating concepts for combined cycle, ramjet, and scramjet engines. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies. This project develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, the efforts and activities under Project 632480, Aerospace Fuels, will be transferred from PE 06030216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology to consolidate the Aerospace Fuels research increasing the transparency for Congress.  The transferred efforts and activities will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

This technology enhances reliability and survivability, and reduces vulnerability, weight, and life cycle costs of air platforms. The electrical power system components developed are projected to provide a two-fold to five-fold improvement in aircraft reliability and maintainability, and a reduction in power system weight. This project is integrated into energy optimized aircraft efforts and power and thermal programs.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633035, Aerospace Power Technology, will be transferred to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platforms Dev\/Demo, Project 633035, Aerospace Power Technology, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high- pressure spool) technology developed under the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, high power extraction, integrated thermal management, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 634921, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Int, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards. These transfers are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated Non-Vanguard efforts and activities will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid rocket motor boosters and missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets. Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized. Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals. Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances in this project could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately twenty to fifty percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately thirty percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems. Aging and surveillance thrusts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by fifty percent, enabling motor replacement for cause. The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The efforts in this project are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program. The efforts in this project are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee annually for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of technical goals defined by the RP21 program.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Edwards Air Force Base, California. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include: scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers; active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition); robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions; and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The objective is to provide continuous evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and\/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aircraft Propulsion Subsystem Integration Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, Project 63681B, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The US BICES program procures and maintains a standing intelligence information sharing capability across Department of Defense (DoD), Combat Support Agencies (CSA), and multiple Combatant Commands (CCMD) for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (OUSD(I)). At the request of OUSD(I), US BICES is extended beyond NATO nations into all CCMDs to support their unique  partner relationships.  This architecture is known as US BICES Extended (US BICES-X). US BICES provides an \"enduring\" US and Coalition interoperable intelligence and information sharing multi-level secure technical architecture utilizing releasable elements of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework and functions to support the full spectrum of intelligence operations and dissemination throughout the DoD community. US BICES\/US BICES-X has been designated the enduring intelligence and information sharing component of the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).\n\nResearch and Development funding will:\n- Provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System Family of Systems.\n- Expand available intelligence disciplines (Geospatial Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potentially Human Intelligence) to support US and allied\/coalition forces.  \n- Support increased intelligence advanced analytics tools, Joint Intelligence Operation Center-IT and DI2E developments to significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES\/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters\/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.\n- Develop and enhance a federated Trusted Network Environment (TNE) that incorporates Foreign Partner information sharing networks globally to support the National Defense Strategy.\n- Develop multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.\n- Expand capabilities for bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs in support of CCMD requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The US BICES program procures and maintains a standing intelligence information sharing capability across Department of Defense (DoD), Combat Support Agencies, and multiple Combatant Commands (CCMD) for the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (USD (I)). At the request of USD (I), US BICES is extended beyond U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) into all CCMDs and is known as US BICES Extended (US BICES-X).  US BICES provides an \"enduring\" US and Coalition interoperable intelligence sharing multi-level secure technical architecture utilizing releasable elements of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework and functions to support the full spectrum of intelligence operations and dissemination throughout the DoD community. Also, it enables instantiation of US BICES\/BICES-X as the intelligence contribution to the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).\n\nResearch and Development funding will:  \n  - Provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks within the Afghanistan theater and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System \u2013 Army. \n  - Provide an increase in intelligence disciplines (Imagery Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potential Human Intelligence) in support of US and Allied\/Coalition forces that currently is very limited to the warfighter. Increased intelligence advanced analytics tools will be migrated from Joint Intelligence Operation Center-IT and DI2E developments and will significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES\/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters\/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines. \n  - Develop and provide a federated Trusted Network Environment (TNE) that incorporates the Asian Pacific intelligence Information Network being developed to support the National Defense Strategy as we transition out of Afghanistan and into the Pacific. \n  - Provide multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists. \n  - Develop the Coalition Partner Network for CENTCOM, the Coalition Information Exchange Network for SOUTHCOM, and the Coalition Partner Network for EUCOM and AFRICOM. \n  - Develop the US BICES connections with these bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs that make up the US BICES-X Enterprise Network in support of Commander SOCOM requirements for conventional and coalition operations as the US migrates into other Combatant Command regions."

            "val": "The U.S. military\u2019s dependence on liquid fuel creates an enormous logistics burden that exposes forces to enemy attack and diverts operational resources from other mission areas to support delivery. GAO cited the department for its lack of (1)\u201dvisibility and accountability for achieving fuel reduction, (2) incentives and a viable funding mechanism to invest in the implementation of fuel demand reduction projects, and (3) guidance and policies that addressed fuel demand.\u201d\n\nThe mission of this program element (PE) since these findings in 2012 has been to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&T) investments.  OECIF fostered innovation to improve operational energy performance in two ways:  first, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that improved the agility and resiliency of our ability to supply forces the energy they need; and second, to establish momentum for components to continue those innovations through ongoing collaboration with the Services, Joint Staff and Combatant Commands.  \n\nOECIF funds served as \u201cseed money\u201d to start or consolidate promising innovations to serve as proof of technological feasibility, with the goal of transitioning science and technology (S&T) into the acquisition process. The focus is on challenges or opportunities that are not Services specific, but rather cross Services, platforms and domains.      \n\nOECIF investments also highlighted areas of Departmental level interest or buy down risk to enable service-level commitments. The primary focus on 6.3 Investments facilitated joint solutions and incentivized cross Service collaboration to transition the acquisition valley of death. OSD investment (37%) in conjunction with investment from DLA, Army, Navy, and USMC of 22% represents almost 60% of the DoD-wide OE 6.3 investment budget.  The Air Force contributes about 40% with 55% of their contribution focused on high-cost engine testing and architecture for high power systems.  \n\nOECIF investments are directly focused on the capability needs expressed in the NDS.  Our ability to predict, detect, and mitigate an adversary\u2019s ability to deny tactical and operational formations the energy needed to prosecute operations at tempo and scale throughout every phase of warfare and to enable freedom of action at all echelons, unencumbered by the challenges of delivering energy across an unbounded multi-domain and contested battlespace.  \n\nTo achieve these goals, the selection process for investments relied on inputs from the Combatant Commands and Services each year through a competitive process.  The OECIF decision process supports the National Security Strategy for energy dominance, all three National Defense Strategy priorities, the DoD Energy Strategy, Department Modernization Priorities, and the needs of the Joint Force and warfighters.  The projects compete on the basis of greatest impact to the warfighter, criticality of operational need, least technical risk, least cost, and the shortest time to employment.  \n\nOECIF success has been measured by its impact.  The overall aim has been to improve the agility, resilience, lethality, readiness, and operational effectiveness of the Joint Force. The key metric is the successful transition of technology from S&T to an acquisition or direct insertion into operations.  Over 75% of OECIF investments have successfully transitioned to support the warfighter.  \n   \nOECIF\u2019s efforts have complimented, not replaced or duplicated, Services investments and have provided a continuingly evolving program to rapidly address new and critical issues arising from emerging threats to our ability to supply the joint force. \n\nExamples of current investments include moving power without mass (power beaming); world-record setting efficiencies for solar power conversion; use of energy scavenging within the warfighting environment, and use of sensors, data analytics and predictive methodologies with the promise of enabling unparalleled operational unpredictability to counter an adversaries \u201cenergy denial\u201d operations. Additional leading technologies enabling extended remote operations without resupply through innovations in the use of energy storage, micro-grids, and nuclear power fuel innovation."

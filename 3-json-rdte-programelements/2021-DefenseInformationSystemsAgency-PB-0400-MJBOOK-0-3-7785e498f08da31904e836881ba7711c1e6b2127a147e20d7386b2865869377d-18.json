            "val": "The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act (CSEA) of 2004 created the Spectrum Relocation Fund (CSEA, Title II of P.L. 108-494) to provide a centralized and streamlined funding mechanism through which Federal agencies can recover the costs associated with relocating their radio communications systems from certain spectrum bands, which were authorized to be auctioned for commercial purposes. \n\nOn January 29, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission completed an auction of Advanced Wireless Service licenses in the 1695-1710 Megahertz (MHz),1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz bands (collectively, the \"AWS-3\u201d bands). On June 23, 2015, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) notified Congress of the forthcoming transfer of $5.030 billion to federal agencies with systems affected by the AWS-3 transition. Following the conclusion of the 30-day statutory waiting period, OMB transferred the funds to the federal agencies. \n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) received $3.500 billion of the auction proceeds and created a $500 million Spectrum Access Research and Development Program (SAR&DP) to investigate new DoD technologies. The SAR&DP encompasses spectrum technology development that enables the DoD to perform its missions using spectrum-dependent systems in a manner that preferably enhances operational readiness and capability. Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for pursued technology solutions. DoD's transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are sufficiently resilient (survivable and electronically protected) to operate in both the United States and congested\/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed. \n\nThis program represents the DISA investment within the SAR&DP."

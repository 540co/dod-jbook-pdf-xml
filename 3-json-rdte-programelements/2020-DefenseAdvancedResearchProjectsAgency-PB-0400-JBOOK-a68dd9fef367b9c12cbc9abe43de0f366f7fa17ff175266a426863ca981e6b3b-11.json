While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users. The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.

SHARE will provide the level of security provided by today's communications systems, while managing trust at the tactical edge.  Building upon the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program, which is budgeted in this PE\/Project, and research into the use of commercial systems and infrastructure to support military operations, SHARE provides new opportunities for U.S. and coalition forces to gain and maintain a tactical advantage on the battlefield.  Coordination includes providing all the information required to enable the command and control necessary to plan and execute operations in all phases of warfare.

The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services."

GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains, building upon the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) coalition warfighter information sharing program, also budgeted in this PE\/Project.  By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray zone activities.

Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost.  The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links.

These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command.  The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries.  This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links.  The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation.  PFC builds on technology developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also budgeted in this PE\/Project.  PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC).  The PFC program will transition to the Services."

The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked sensor and data capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor and radar bands with communication systems.  The program will leverage technologies originally developed for radar anti-jam and interference mitigation that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will transition to the Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA)."

Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems strained the size of networks that current communications technology could support in the contested environment.  As adversary capabilities advanced, the DoD needed new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability.  As part of Advanced Networking technologies efforts, the C2E program addressed these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, it developed heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols were developed.  Second, the program created a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that drew from commercial communication architectures.  The defense contractor community built specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture.  Finally, C2E created a government controlled development environment to allow for rapid refresh of communications technology and allowed third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Navy."

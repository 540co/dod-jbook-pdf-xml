            "val": "SF100 Aviation Systems Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF common avionics; SOF Common Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA) radar, best known as Silent Knight Radar (SKR) or AN\/APQ-187; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser; AC-130H\/W\/U and MC-130E\/H\/P Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Tactical Mission Networking (TMN), formerly known as Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; mission systems automation and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.\n\nSF200 CV-22 Development\/Test and Evaluation:\nThe CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration (infill), exfiltration (exfill), and resupply to SOF teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, SOF communications, defensive\/survivability systems, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.\nCV-22 SOF Common TF\/TA SKR provides long-range, night\/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable\/capable replacement to obsolescing and technology limited TF\/TA AN\/APQ-174\/186 Multi-Mode Radar (MMR). The Full-azimuth Defensive Weapon System (FDWS), in combination with the ramp-mounted gun, provides a ~360 degree field of fire to suppress\/eliminate enemy targets.  The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the United States Marine Corps (USMC) MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar Color Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation.\n\nSF300:  Armed Overwatch:\nArmed Overwatch provides Special Operations Forces (SOF) deployable and sustainable aircraft systems fulfilling Close Air Support, Precision Strike, and SOF Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) requirements in austere and permissive environments for the Countering-Violent Extremist Organizations mission.  Armed Overwatch missions include: Armed ISR, Strike Coordination & Reconnaissance, and Airborne Forward Air Control.  The funding in this project supports development, integration, prototype demonstrations, testing of SOF-unique capabilities and Air Worthiness Release efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nS750 Mission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThe Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, rapid prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. \n\nS875 AC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging\/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Combat Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Combat Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft provide clandestine single or multi-ship low-level aerial refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and conducts airdrops of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles, and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  Incremental upgrade and agile software delivery approaches will be used to rapidly prototype, integrate and mature SOF capabilities onto the aircraft.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to: Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following\/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC\/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command\u2019s (AFSOC) legacy C-130 fleet.\n\nD615 Rotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique rotary wing aviation and training requirements. This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), avionics, and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, address cyber security, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operations at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF in the multi-domain operations (MDO) environments and against near peer threats.  The anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.\n\nThese technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate."

The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, weapons, SOF communications, avionics, defensive\/survivability systems, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV-22 platform.\n\nCV-22 SOF Common Terrain Following Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA) Silent Knight Radar (SKR): Provides long-range, night\/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas for infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of SOF forces. This more sustainable and capable radar replaces the obsolescing APQ-186 terrain following\/avoidance radar currently integrated on CV-22 aircraft.\n\nCV-22 Block 20 Systems: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, SOF communications, avionics, defensive\/survivability systems, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  Included within Block 20 is the Full-azimuth Defensive Weapon System (FDWS). FDWS provides the CV-22 with the capability to suppress threats in the forward hemisphere while the aircraft is in the critical phase of landing and takeoff at the mission objective. The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the United States Marine Corps MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar Color Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation."

The SKR replaces the obsolescing APQ-186 TF\/TA multimode radar on the CV-22. The acquisition strategy for the CV-22 SOF Common TF\/TA SKR program is to procure radar units and radar software modifications through the USSOCOM SKR program management office, buy aircraft modification kits, and integrate SKR into CV-22 aircraft using a mixture of both sole source and competitive contracts.\n\nThe Block 20 Full-azimuth Defensive Weapon System (FDWS) will be based on modifications to the legacy Defensive Weapon System (DWS) currently fielded on USMC MV-22 aircraft and previously ground tested on a CV-22. These modifications will integrate the DWS with the CV-22 pilots color helmet mounted displays and cockpit controls to correct deficiencies\/improve system effectiveness.  They will be awarded on a competitive EMD contract for development."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications provide clandestine single or multi-ship low-level aerial refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; conduct airdrops of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles, and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  Incremental upgrade and agile software development approaches will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to: Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA), electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC\/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command\u2019s legacy C-130 fleet."

The airframe efforts (new rotor blades\/flight control kits and new shells) will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframes.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item\/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted via a contract with the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).\n\n\u2022 MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on MH-60M helicopters.  The Mods and Upgrades are executed via various acquisition vehicles and includes, but are not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted via a contract with the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).\n\n\u2022 DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in DVE.  A competitive source selection process was conducted, resulting in down-selection of one vendor for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time \u201csee through\u201d imagery and visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  \n\n\u2022 FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years. \n\n\u2022 IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A\/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Department of Navy IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The government will integrate the systems onto the A\/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.  Will begin evaluation and qualification of an infrared exhaust suppressor for the A\/MH-6M aircraft, and continue flare testing for emerging threats.  \n\n\u2022 MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS.  The upgrades and modifications are executed via various acquisition vehicles and consist mostly of government and contractor executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed. Post-production block modifications are accomplished via a contract with the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).\n\n\u2022 MPU provides for future cockpit architecture studies that will help define the replacement of current mission and video processors for all ARSOA platforms.  Additionally it will address near term required upgrades to existing components.  Potential upgrades will be through existing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), while the future cockpit architecture studies will be competitively awarded.\n\n\u2022 Tactical (Airborne) Mission Networking provides for future communications and networking capability exploration and solution development that will ensure ARSOA platforms can communicate through voice and data in a highly contested and congested RF environment. Additionally, it will ensure ARSOA aircraft can maintain interoperability with the SOF and conventional ground forces\u2019 plan of rapidly and continually updating their communications and networking infrastructure.  Non-developmental communication equipment will be procured through existing DOD contracts.  Aircraft integration will be through existing aircraft modification contracts.\n\n\u2022 ASE RFCM Upgrades develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements\/upgrades of fielded aircraft survivability systems and countermeasures.   For new systems, other services\u2019 development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the OEM.\n\n\u2022 IRES integrates non-developmental multi-spectral electro-optical sensor systems (EOSS) onto SOF Rotary Wing aircraft to address legacy system obsolescence, reduce aircraft weight, and provide improved system performance.  To the maximum extent possible, systems will be procured through existing USSOCOM and Services contracts.  Aircraft integration will be through existing aircraft modification contracts."

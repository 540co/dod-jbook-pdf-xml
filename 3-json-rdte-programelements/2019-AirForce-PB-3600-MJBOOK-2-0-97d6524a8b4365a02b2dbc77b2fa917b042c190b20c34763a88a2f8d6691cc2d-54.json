            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight re-planning as applicable.\n\nThe Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms. It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed- and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions. It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service, open architecture system, frequently referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive\/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue. MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft and is shared with the selected programs in the Navy. MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.\n\nFY19 funding will continue MPS Inc 5 project which will complete the initial migration of select Air Force platforms from their legacy planning systems to the new Mission Planning System (aka (JMPS)). MPS Inc 5 is comprised of three efforts originally started as separate and individual projects with the MPS Modernization development effort. Those projects are: 1) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS); 2) Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition; and 3) Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR). These projects, and their associated platforms, are now included in the overarching program known as MPS Inc 5 to improve transparency and oversight. As such, MPS Inc 5 is a continuation of efforts previously stated under the development umbrella of the MPS Modernization project.  Inc 5, formally an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAC Program, was reclassified to ACAT III by the Milestone Decision Authority on 17 October 2017.  \n\nIn addition, FY19 funding will continue the MPS Modernization project.\n     It will develop pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning capabilities for Air Force aircraft Global Positioning System (GPS) and weapons migrating from legacy mission planning systems to the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), as well as, continuing to provide new capabilities and updates for Air Force platforms\/weapon systems that have already migrated to JMPS.  These platforms\/weapon systems include, but are not limited to, the B-1, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, RC-135, and their associated weapons (e.g., Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), Network Enabled Weapons (NEW)) Development of NEW modules support the configuration of this class of weapons, thereby; enabling warfighters to enter and execute missions using data links used by US and coalition aircraft. It will support the development of follow on modernization efforts for MAFPS, SMACC CSAR (HC\/MC-130, HH-60)and Global Mobility (C-5,C-17,C-130, KC-10, KC-135, KC-46) to be delivered after the initial MPS Inc 5 releases are fielded. \n\nFinally, FY19 funding will be utilized to continue the development of the Joint Precision Airdrop System- Mission Planning (JPADS-MP)system in conjunction with the Army. This program includes the JPADS-MP airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17, C-130 and other selected platforms as necessary and deliver a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions, as well as, precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/or standoff precision delivery. JPADS-MP enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, and other data to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight re-planning as applicable.\n\nThis project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) capability in conjunction with the Army.  JPADS provides a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/ or standoff precision delivery.  It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, while mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of exposure to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, and other data to accurately deliver payloads to combat and other friendly forces.\n\nConsolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable.  It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop.  Future initiatives are designated to achieve automation of airdrop planning and execution to reduce task saturation in the cockpit and support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) objective of moving to a two-man cockpit.  These efforts include the ability to automatically receive and use real-time winds in any location, calculation of a release point and airdrop in a single pass, the ability to conduct real-time objective area analysis to calculate probable damage estimates and execute dynamic re-tasking, the ability to conduct post-drop assessments, and the implementation of new technologies (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Touch Screen environment).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been\nfielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nFY19 funding continues CAT v6.x and 7.x while beginning 8.x development and testing to provide precision and conventional airdrop capabilities including, but not limited to, Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE), 3D Hazard and obstruction data for guided delivery system navigation, automation for aircrew in-flight airdrop workflow, Extracted Container Delivery Systems (ExCDS), data services to multiple mission planning devices, and calculations to maximize payload impact success on drop zones. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability.The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight re-planning as applicable. This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60 other platforms, Framework (FW) and all Common Component (CCs) software tools for mission requirements.

It will complete development and begin Operational Testing (OT) of three efforts originally started as separate and individual projects within the MPS Modernization development effort.  Those projects are:\n\n1) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS);\n2) Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition; and \n3) Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR)\n\nThese projects, and their associated platforms, comprise the overarching program known as MPS Inc 5.\n\nSpecific capabilities include but are not limited to the following:\n  \nA. Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS):  The MAFPS component to MPS Inc 5 provides modern flight planning service compliant with current and emerging airspace and air traffic control constraints.  Central to the program is an improved route and fuel optimizer.  MAFPS replaces the legacy Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP) system.  Warfighter benefits include:\n\n- Flight planning calculations for Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC)-managed missions and AMC aircraft\n- Produce and graphically display optimum mission routes, fuel calculations, and aerial refueling activity\n- Calculate optimized fuel loads to include Cost Indexing\n- Graphical user interface and capability to dynamically re-compute flight plans\n\nB. AMC Transition:  The AMC Transition to MPS component will migrate selected Airlift (C-17, C-5), Tanker (KC-135, KC-10) and Air Drop (C-17, C-130) platforms from their legacy Portable Flight Planning Systems (PFPS) mission planning systems which is sun setting at the end of FY2020.  Additional warfighter benefits include:\n\n- Color moving map (Digimap) Common Component\n- Enhanced Air Refueling Common Component\n- Aircraft Flight Performance Module (FPM)\/Take-Off and Landing Data (TOLD)\/ Vehicle Install Package (VIP) Development\n- Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) certified navigation avionics images\n\nC. Special Missions Air Combat Command (SMACC) Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR):  This development effort will migrate the CSAR community (HH-60, HC\/MC-130 aircraft) from PFPS to the MPS environment.  Warfighter benefits include:\n\n- Ability to support a spectrum of missions ranging from simple day-to-day training and proficiency flying to peacetime operational\/exercise sorties\n- Rapid mission planning\n- Mission data transfer to the aircraft via DTD\n- In flight situational awareness"

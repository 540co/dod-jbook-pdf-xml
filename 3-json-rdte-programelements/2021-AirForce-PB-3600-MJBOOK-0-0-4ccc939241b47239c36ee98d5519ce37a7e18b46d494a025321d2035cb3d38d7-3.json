Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) will plan and manage these funds at the enterprise level to achieve the intent of the Strategy.\n\nIn FY 2021, the Air Force created PE 0602020F, Future AF Capabilities Applied Research, Project 620200, Enterprise Transformational Applied Research, to consolidate the specific Future AF Capabilities Applied Research efforts\/ activities from the following PEs and Projects: PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 622403, Flight Controls and Pilot-Vehicle Interface; PE 0602202F, Human Effectiveness Applied Research, Project 625328, Human Dynamics Evaluation; PE 0602204F, Aerospace Sensors, Project 627622, RF Sensors and Countermeasures Tech; PE 0602602F, Conventional Munitions, Project 622068, Advanced Guidance Technology; and PE 0602788F, Dominant Information Sciences and Methods, Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019, and execute transformational Applied Research.\n\nThis Program Element creation and realignment of funding from the existing Air Force RDT&E Applied Research PEs are administrative realignments and not a new start. \n\nThese activities are managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Chief Technologist located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, at the Enterprise level, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorate locations. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this program element would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

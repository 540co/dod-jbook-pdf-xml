            "val": "Prior to FY 2016, the Navy developed a capability called Automated Test and Retest (ATRT). ATRT supported reproducible and quantitative testing and analysis of Naval Ship Combat Systems Integration, AEGIS Combat System Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 12, Antisubmarine Warfare Integrated Common Processor\/Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off The Shelf Insertion (ARCI), and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module development. Funding also supported expansion of ATRT to other NAVSEA-affiliated programs. The success of ATRT in reducing the time to complete critical testing, improve and speed test analysis, find and correct critical design flaws has led to an expansion of the capability to a Naval enterprise wide effort, not just a Navy Ship effort. In FY 2016, ATRT was expanded to include the entire Naval enterprise and renamed Automated Test and Analysis (ATA). ATA expands the automated test methods currently in use such as Automated Test and Re-Test, adds new methods of testing and use of automated test technologies, and standardizes automated test practices, methods and tools. In addition, funding supports the development of enterprise level strategies to apply ATA technology to the software-intensive acquisition programs. The FY 2015 ATRT project was funded on Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88: \"Automated Test and Re-Test\". Starting in FY16 and through the out-years, the project is renamed \"Automated Test and Analysis\" on Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88."

The Navy will also determine enterprise solutions that significantly reduce test and evaluation man-hours, positively impact fleet training, and improve test plans and procedures. \n \nThe Navy will continue: \n- Assessing undersea warfare capabilities or fleet modernization and future Navy testing competencies\n- Evaluating best practices and research platform network resiliency and system function validation\n- Determining common elements through ATA analysis\n- Identify synergies in development, implementation and training across multiple SYSCOMs\n- Augmenting both surface and air Mission Planning for requirements traceability.\n\nSpecific topics include but are not limited to:\n- Continuing advanced Combat System development\/enhancements (SSDS and AEGIS)\n- Testing of shipboard navigation or mechanical systems and tactical data links analysis (Link-16)\n- Integrating test and analyses among various Strike Force Interoperability platforms \n- Implementing test planning\/manager improvements\n\nThe Navy will conduct another Naval enterprise-wide data call soliciting automated test tool proposals that can significantly reduce the time to complete critical testing, improve and speed test analysis, and identify and correct critical design flaws in testing of Naval acquisition programs for further study in FY 2019."

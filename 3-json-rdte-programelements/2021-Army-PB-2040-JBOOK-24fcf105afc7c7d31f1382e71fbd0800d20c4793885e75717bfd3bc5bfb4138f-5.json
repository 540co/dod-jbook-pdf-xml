            "val": "Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), formerly known as Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), is the Army's next generation surface-to-surface missile that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. PrSM requirements include: max range of greater than 400 kilometers (km), specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds two missiles, survivability in a threat environment, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A2 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). PrSM will meet cluster and insensitive munition requirements and is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Future Spirals will include the ability to attack moving maritime and ground targets, provide increased lethality and extended range. The mission of the PrSM System is to attack\/ neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. PrSM will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24\/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly\/ staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. PrSM will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. Milestone A was approved on 31 March 2017 and the program is currently in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2021 base dollars in the amount of $122.733 million supports the transition of PrSM from TMRR to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD). The program successfully completed a flight demonstration in 1st Quarter (1Q) FY 2020 and awarded a follow-on TMRR agreement to a single contractor. TMRR efforts to include: finalize tactical design, complete sub-assembly and missile qualification testing, finalize missile interface, and continue software integration with existing launcher platforms before flight testing four (4) PrSM Engineering Development Test (EDT) missiles. Additionally, the program will establish pilot line manufacturing processes and validate capabilities to support PrSM production.  Demonstration of capabilities through a rigorous test program ensures the Army makes an informed production decision for building missiles beginning in FY 2022. After completion of Milestone B, the Government will award a single EMD phase contract for final Government safety and qualification testing."

PrSM provides an open system architecture that facilitates future growth. PrSM provides responsive engagement of high value point and area targets by Army and Joint Force Commanders under all weather conditions, at operational ranges defended by enemy air-defense systems. An AoA supporting the MS A decision was completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with an OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. In 4Q FY 2016, the Army awarded 9 month risk reduction, trade study and initial design development agreements to two contractors. The effort resulted in development of initial baseline designs presented during final technical reviews that resulted in a seamless transition into the TMRR phase. Subsequent to MS A approval on 31 March 2017, the Army awarded TMRR agreements to two contractors. TMRR is ongoing and includes risk reduction activities and further maturation of contractor design concepts. Both contractors participated in a PDR in 1Q FY 2019 to inform design.\n\nIn FY 2018, the Army directed acceleration of PrSM capability in response to immediate near-peer threats and the requirement to engage targets with a precision guided missile out to 499km. As a result, the program was restructured to conduct the following key activities previously not planned for in TMRR: finalize tactical designs, build additional missiles for system level EDT flight tests, begin subsystem qualification, and establish a production capability. This approach allows the Army to reduce program risk prior to EMD award, and accelerate an early capability. \n\nThe EMD phase will include assembly of PQT flight test articles in parallel with completion of ground and system qualification, tactical software integration on the HIMARS and M270A2 launch platforms and production planning efforts. Also during this time the program will refine critical missile survivability assessments to ensure the selected EMD design will successfully meet the Army's PrSM kinetic, electro-magnetic spectrum, cyber, environmental, nuclear requirements. The culmination of these efforts will inform a Government CDR planned for 1Q FY 2022 and support of fielding an early capability via Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) in FY23.  After the program meets the UMR requirements the remaining EMD phase activities will complete product development, system level qualification, production readiness assessment, and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E).\n\nBeginning in FY 2021 and thru the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), the Army has programmed Missile Procurement Army (MIPA) funding on line item number 8540C29600. These funds will support initial UMR fielding to close the capability gap between the current capability and near-peer missile capabilities before the program transitions to Full Rate Production (FRP)."

The radios will operate in networks supporting the Common Operating Picture, Situational Awareness, and interoperability of Mission Command systems throughout the battlefield.  AMF radios will ensure the Soldier's ability to communicate both horizontally and vertically via voice and data within all mission areas and Common Operating Environment.  AMF radios will operate waveforms that are deployed by Joint Forces today, and will introduce networking waveforms to the Aviation community that will enable interoperability between air and ground forces and transport operational and Mission Command information through the tactical network.  AMF radios will help close capability gaps by extending data networking to company and below echelons, enabling network services to the platform and connecting Army Aviation platforms to Army ground and Joint air network domains. \n\nPer MDA direction, the AMF Program will procure radios as Non-Developmental Items. FY 2019 RDTE funding allocated to SANR (Project EG6) supports planned program activities, such as, source selection testing and acquisition activities in support of contract award and continued development of documentation to support Milestone C.  As part of the CSA Network Review, the Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) is reviewing the current network portfolio, to include review of the SANR program path and Capability Production Document.

AMF is now managed by Program Executive Office Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, under Project Manager Tactical Radios, and funded by Army PE 0605380A. On May 2, 2014, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, issued an ADM that designated Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) and Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) as subprograms under the AMF Program. In FY 2015, Project EA9 represented the total Airborne Maritime Fixed Small Airborne (AMF-SA, or SALT) RDT&E budget. In FY 2016, funding was allocated between the SALT (Project EA9) and SANR (Project EG6) subprograms.  The SALT subprogram was closed out during FY 2016.

The SANR is a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency Type 1 certified networking radio providing seamless real-time information for operation in mobile and dynamic combat environments that will meet tactical communications requirements as validated by the Army Aviation community.  SANR will provide increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms via advanced networking capabilities supporting Mid-Tier and Lower Tier tactical networks, and maintain Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capability.  SANR will replace the current SINCGARS radios on Army Aviation platforms.  SANR is planned for implementation on the following platforms: Apache (AH-64E), Black Hawk (UH-60V, UH-60M, HH-60M, and MH-60M), Chinook (CH-47F and MH-47G), and Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (MQ-1C) aircraft.  SANR will enhance and further enable the ability of the maneuver commander to integrate and synchronize aviation forces with land based operational forces. SANR, employed on Army aviation platforms, will enable aviation combat elements (Combat Aviation Brigades, Theater Aviation Brigades, and Special Operations Aviation Regiment) to better utilize the inherent versatility of airborne communications as a complement to the unique capabilities of the other combat arms.  SANR will give commanders enhanced Situational Awareness and Mission Command in a package that provides a more responsive means of directing aircraft to match changing maneuver forces situations and missions.\n\nFY 2019 RDTE funding allocated to SANR supports planned program activities, such as, source selection testing and acquisition activities in support of contract award and continued development of documentation to support Milestone C.  As part of the CSA Network Review, the Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) is reviewing the current network portfolio, to include review of the SANR program path and Capability Production Document.  The SANR Program path forward is expected to evolve based on outcomes of the CSA Network Review and Network CFT efforts, as part of a modernized Army network.\n\nFY 2019 RDTE funds also support the procurement of Link-16 handheld radios for experimentation and concept refinement for air-ground integration, in coordination with the Network CFT."

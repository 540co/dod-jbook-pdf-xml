Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provide the sole means for verification of NC3 systems\u2019 performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test & Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center)."

In addition, performance of the NC3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element. These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management. Performance of the SLC3S-Airborne fleet is measured by the technical assessment results documented in the assessment reports. Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff and the DoD CIO to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.\n\nSpecific performance metrics include the following:\n\nProvide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD\/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nConduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD\/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.\n\nMEECN is on track to achieve the FY 2018, FY 2019, and FY 2020 targets of provisioning the Joint Staff requirements within the allocated resources 90% of the time."

The Universal Products will be capable of flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems.  Protected in a climate-controlled, standard S-280 or S-788 U.S. Army shelter and mounted on either a standard Army FMTV or HMMWV, the UGCS receives and disseminates battlefield video and situational awareness data through state-of-the-art operator consoles.  Consoles can be used to provide aircraft command and control, payload control and weapons launch.  \n\nThe UGDT provides a Line of Sight (LOS) capability for transmit and receipt of UAS command and control, and UAS payload product.  The UGDT is the common datalink system for U. S. Army UAS.\n\nThe Universal Mission Simulator (UMS) consists of the hardware and software required to fully train UAS operators to full Readiness Level (RL) 1.  The UMS will be capable of training and simulating flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems and features Directorate of Simulation (DOS) accredited Shadow software and Gray Eagle software.\n\nJustification: FY2018 Universal Product Base funding of $38.867 will be used for starting the development of modifications needed to address UGCS obsolescence, maintain interoperability, increase commonality (including a controller to support weapons), and continue development of training devices in support of Trainer System Engineering, Software\/System Sustainment, Currency, and Field Support."

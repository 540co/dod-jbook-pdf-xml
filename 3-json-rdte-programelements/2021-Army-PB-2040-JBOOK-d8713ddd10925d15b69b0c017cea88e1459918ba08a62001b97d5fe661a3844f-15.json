Cyber SU allows for the visualization and understanding of physical (geographical), logical (at a specific network internet protocol), and cyber persona layers (bad actors, from individuals to nation states) of cyberspace. This is based on data\/information from multiple sources and sensors that produce a CEMA overlay on the commander's Common Operational Picture (COP) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE). Supporting CEMA, Cyber SU synchronizes and integrates blue (friendly) cyberspace data, red (enemy), and grey (commercial\/private sector), and enables collaboration at the tactical echelon. (PEO C3T)\n\n655041EV5:\n- Tactical DCO Infrastructure (TDI) is a software-only program, which consists of pre-configured DCO tools residing on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI). The TDI capability will reside within the Command Post at echelon Corps through Brigade for both organic Cyber Network Defenders as well as remote access by Cyber Protection teams (CPT) to support defense of the Tactical Network. (PEO C3T)\n\n- Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) consists of platform and software programs which are key elements of the DCO Maneuver Baseline infrastructure, platform, and tools. The employment of defensive capabilities creates specific effects in cyberspace through actions that allow commanders to achieve the following objectives: deter, destroy, and defeat enemy offensive cyberspace operations; gain time; economy of force; control key terrain; protect tasked critical assets and infrastructure; and develop intelligence. DCO supports the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER), Army Cyberspace Operations and Integration Center (ACOIC), (5) Regional Cyber Centers (RCCs), Cyber Warfare Battalion (CWB), Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), Cyber Protection Brigade (CPB), and (41) Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) in COMPO 1\/2\/3. (PEO EIS)\n\n- ARCYBER Rapid Cyber Prototyping provides capabilities that can quickly respond to emerging cyber threats and keep up with threat technology. ARCYBER identifies potential development and prototyping efforts via Cyber Needs Forms (CNFs) based on operational feedback, changes in tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs), and trends of adversarial activity. These are separate and distinct from DCO programs identified and are used to rapidly address a network threat\/vulnerability. (ARCYBER)"

The Requirements Definition Package (RDP) was approved on 19 Mar 19 by the AROC Requirements Board. The Cyber SU program is under an IT Box construct with a five (5) year term (FY20-24) which aligns with the current RDP.\n\nThe Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), approved the Materiel Development Decision on 20 Jun 18, designating Cyber SU as an ACAT III AIS program. The program is currently scheduled for a Milestone B decision review 2Q20.\n\nThe program is employing a tailored acquisition model for Agile Software Development, under which Cyber SU will develop a series of testable, integrated subsets of capability to meet the overall full functional values of the RDP through the use of Capability Drops (CDs). Subsequent CDs are to be approved by the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence in collaboration with U.S. Army Forces Command. To that end, the program office intends to evaluate and leverage COTS\/NDI products to the greatest extent and leverage cyber solutions from science and technology efforts (e.g., Cyber Mission Impact Tool (CMIT), as well as ingest data from related programs (e.g, DCO, TDI, CPCE, EWPMT, UNO, DCGS-A). Prototyping and development will employ a combination of Government entities and commercial vendors via an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contract vehicle. Coordination and integration with complimentary programs and systems (sources of cyber data feeds) will be an integral part of the program to ensure the data is made available to be consumed by the Cyber SU solution. Cyber SU will be hosted on the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and will be fielded by the CPCE\/TSI program in accordance with their fielding schedule."

The employment of defensive capabilities creates specific effects in cyberspace through actions that allow commanders to achieve the following objectives: deter, destroy, and defeat enemy offensive cyberspace operations; gain time; economy of force; control key terrain; protect tasked critical assets and infrastructure; and develop intelligence. DCO supports the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER), Army Cyberspace Operations and Integration Center (ACOIC), (5) Regional Cyber Centers (RCCs), Cyber Warfare Battalion (CWB), Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), Cyber Protection Brigade (CPB), and (41) Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) in COMPO 1\/2\/3.\n\n- ARCYBER Rapid Cyber Prototyping provides capabilities that can quickly respond to emerging cyber threats and keep up with threat technology. ARCYBER identifies potential development and prototyping efforts via Cyber Needs Forms (CNFs) based on operational feedback, changes in tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs), and trends of adversarial activity. These are separate and distinct from DCO programs identified and are used to rapidly address a network threat\/vulnerability."

The TDI program's RDP was approved on 8 Nov 18 by the Army Requirement Board (ARB). Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved a tailored defense unique software intensive acquisition approach for TDI. To support this agile acquisition approach, the TDI program office will develop and deploy pre-configured software in a series of capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. The TDI program had a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) of TDI's initial capability approved by the MDA on Sep 19, which allowed the program to achieve IOC Oct 19. TDI is hosted on the Tactical\nServer Infrastructure (TSI) and will be fielded by the CPCE\/TSI program in accordance with their fielding schedule. Execution of the TDI program will be a combination of government entities and commercial vendors.\n\nThe ARB approved Cyber Analytics and DCO Tool Suite RDPs on 24 Apr 18; Mission Planning on 26 Jun 18; and User Activity Monitoring and Forensics and Malware on 16 Oct 18. The MDA designated these as ACAT IV programs. Under subsequent reviews, the MDA approved agile acquisition approach to develop and deliver preconfigured software in a series of releases and capability drops in order to deliver full functional values of the RDP that align with DCO priorities. DCO programs utilize standard and 874 agile pilot evolutionary acquisition processes (30-90 rapid acquisition approach). DCO continually delivers new technologies and capabilities as a prototype and fields updated capabilities.

MTFs provide access to the patient populations who will benefit the most from the medical products and capabilities being developed. The funds support the retention of technical subject matter expertise, independent of the number of assigned projects. The infrastructure funds also support Institutional Review Board functions, research technical support, statistical support, grant writing assistance, and other essential functions for maintaining research in MTFs. The funds do not support research, but provide the infrastructure support enabling MTF investigators to compete for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) research funds.\n\nThe Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS) Laboratory Infrastructure Support provides management support for research infrastructure at selected overseas laboratories and research sites that conduct bio surveillance and basic to late-stage clinical research and evaluation of investigational products, such as biologics, drugs, protectants, technologies, and knowledge products to treat\/prevent infectious diseases for the purpose of protecting the Warfighter; this is accomplished through collaborative efforts with the respective host nation governments. These sites are the US Army Medical Research Directorate-Kenya (USAMRD-K) in Nairobi, Kenya, the US Army Medical Research Directorate-Georgia (USAMRD-G) in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the US Army Medical Directorate-Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (USAMD-AFRIMS) in Bangkok, Thailand.

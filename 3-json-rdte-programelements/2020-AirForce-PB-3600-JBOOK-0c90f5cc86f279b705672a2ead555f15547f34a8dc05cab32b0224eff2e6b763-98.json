                "val": "The FY20 PB supports 1,908 authorizations, $251.410M for civilian pay requirements and $7.257M for non-pay requirements. The FY20 budgeted Average Work Year Cost (AWYC) is $131,766. The $29.978M FY20 (FY19 PB) to FY20 (FY20 PB) increase is due to 111 additional authorizations ($14.626M), a budgeted AWYC increase ($8.157M), and new non-pay increase ($7.195M). The additional 111 authorizations in this program element are a result of 30 new authorizations for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Fleet Management Office (FMO), 25 new authorizations for the Light Air Attack program, and 56 authorizations realigned from the Program Integration and Development Directorate due to workload transition within the Center.  The budgeted AWYC increased approximately $4.275K per authorization due to the FY19 PB not funding the FY20 authorizations to the estimated AWYC. Additional non-pay funding supports an inflation increase and operational support for the new JSF FMO."

The other seven AFLCMC acquisition workforce civilian pay program elements are 0605827F Global Vigilance and Combat Systems, 0605828F Global Reach, 0605829F Global Cyber, Network, and Business Systems, 0605830F Global Battle Management, 0605831F Capability Integration, 0605832F Advanced Program Technology, and 0605898F Management Headquarters.\n\nThe Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) equips U.S. and allied forces with operational weapon systems in support of military and national security operations. The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle. The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  This program element supports both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

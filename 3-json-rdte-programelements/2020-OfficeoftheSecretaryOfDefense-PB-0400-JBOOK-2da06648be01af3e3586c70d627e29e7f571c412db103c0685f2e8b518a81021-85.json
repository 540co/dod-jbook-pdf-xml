Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation. Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform)."

This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision into the process of object detection, identification, and tracking at computer process speed versus human speed. Incorporating computer vision and algorithms will reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data. Project Maven develops algorithms focused on tactical UAV FMV Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and an operational PED environment for platforms and ground stations. AW builds capabilities, integrate AI and ML to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for object detection, classification and user alerts."

            "val": "The mission of Nuclear Matters is to ensure the continued credibility, effectiveness, safety, and security of the U.S. deterrent in order to deter nuclear and non-nuclear attack; assure U.S. allies and partners; achieve U.S. objectives if deterrence fails; and hedge against an uncertain future. Nuclear Matters serves as the DoD focal point for the modernization and sustainment of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, as well as for a wide range of nuclear counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation issues. \n\nThe funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons modernization, sustainment; security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety; and survivability requirements. Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC) activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response. Additionally, Nuclear Matters serves as the focal point for DoD activities and initiatives related to the dual missions of sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and countering the threat from nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation.  \n\nNuclear Matters is leading a Tri-Lab effort (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories) to provide data-driven, mission engineering support to integrated portfolio management for 21st Century nuclear deterrent sustainment and modernization. The United States is modernizing all three legs of its nuclear triad and is also reconstituting its nuclear weapons production capability at roughly the same time, while simultaneously sustaining weapons and systems that have aged well beyond their original design lives. The Nuclear Weapons Council and the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group need to manage the transition from legacy Cold War delivery systems and weapons to replacement systems and warheads and make decisions that will affect U.S. national security through the end of the 21st Century. To field a modern, threat-informed nuclear deterrent that will keep pace with evolving adversary capabilities, it is necessary to quantify and compare the relative performance contributions of a variety of military characteristics and weapons options to make data-driven decisions concerning the future of the U.S. nuclear deterrent.\n\nThis Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

The NDERG, in FY 2019, expanded its responsibility to provide advice and assistance to the Deputy Secretary of Defense on matters pertaining to management, operations, and health of the DoD Nuclear Enterprise. In addition, the NDERG will provide a forum for strategic-level coordination and integration of issues arising from the Department's other functional oversight committees and councils related to the nuclear enterprise.\n\nThe NDERG meets on a biennial basis and provides a forum for senior Defense leaders to identify, track, coordinate, and address issues, risks, and opportunities across the nuclear enterprise to ensure that outcomes of the 2014 Nuclear Enterprise Reviews, and outcomes of 2018 Nuclear Posture Review related to the health, management, and operations of the DoD Nuclear Enterprise, are pursued to completion."

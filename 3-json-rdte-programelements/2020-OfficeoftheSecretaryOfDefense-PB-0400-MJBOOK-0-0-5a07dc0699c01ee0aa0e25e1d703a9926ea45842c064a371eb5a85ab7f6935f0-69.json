            "val": "This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the mission and systems engineering duties as described in Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, \"Establishment of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment,\" July 13, 2018.  The Director, Mission Engineering (D, ME) and Director, Systems Engineering under the Deputy Director, Mission Engineering & Integration (DD, ME&I) are the principal advisors to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense (DoD).  The DD, ME&I develops policies and guidance for: (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems, and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance manufacturing, reliability, availability and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainment; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DD, ME&I develops new methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) incorporating state of the practice into engineering for the DoD in both weapon system design, and design tools.  The DD, ME&I reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  Based on the DD, ME&I\u2019s continuous program engagement, the DD, ME&I advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense regarding systems engineering, development planning, reliability and maintainability (R&M) engineering planning, and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DD, ME&I provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program\u2019s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DD, ME&I also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements (e.g. the Sustainment Key Performance Parameter), to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.\n\nIn alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the Systems Engineering (SE) Program Element supports a more lethal force by analyzing near-, mid-, and long-term approaches to realizing mission capability, assessing that capability against anticipated adversaries in relevant AORs, and determine revised system, architectural, tech surprise opportunities to maintain tactical edge, insert technology, improve interoperability and formulate long-term strategies to retain or improve our capabilities against our adversaries. The SE Program Element oversees, initiates, or recommends opportunities to align technology investments to accelerate capability delivery, or modification of existing systems. SE Program Element supports modernizing key capabilities and cultivating workforce talent by developing SE methods, policies, processes, and tools that cross cuts technologies and integrates technical disciplines to advance DoD engineering practices and providing advocacy and oversight for the Department's systems engineering workforce to build a capable, current, and innovative engineering workforce. The SE Program Element also supports reforming the Department for greater performance and affordability by conducting independent technical risk assessments (ITRAs) on MDAPs to advise the USD(R&E) on progress towards achieving key performance parameters, technology maturation, interoperability, and cyber security posture.\n\nThe DD, ME&I issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering across the Department.  The DD, ME&I improves DoD\u2019s SE capabilities through advocacy, oversight, policy, and guidance for the acquisition workforce responsible for Engineering, and Production, Quality & Manufacturing (PQM); in Engineering Tools and Environments; and in Specialty Engineering.  \n\nThe DD, ME&I periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  \n\nBeginning in FY 2019, this PE will support activities to carry out responsibilities described in Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 855 titled Mission Integration Management (MIM).\n\nFunding from Project Code 143, Program Protection, will be re-aligned to a new Maintaining Technology Advantage Program Element (PE) 0605797D8Z, beginning in FY 2020 to support efforts which have transitioned to the Deputy Director, Strategic Technology Protection and Exploitation (STP&E)."

The Department of Defense (DoD) must address cybersecurity and supply chain risks to DoD networks, weapons systems, and information stored and processed on both DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified contractor information networks that support DoD programs.  Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drives the need for diligent program protection planning and execution.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of classified and unclassified controlled technical information, critical program information, critical components and critical mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition and S&T practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor information networks; improve mitigation and management of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify and protect Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of DoD Instruction 8582.01 Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems for Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks.\n\nDD, STP&E provides independent assessments of research, technology and defense acquisition program\u2019s system security engineering and program protection implementation.\n\nThe DD, STP&E reviews and approves the PPP  for each MDAP, and monitors and reviews the system security engineering planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  \n\nThis PE includes efforts by the office of the DD, STP&E in implementing the Department\u2019s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of the DD, STP&E systems engineering and technical reviews. \n\nIn FY 2020, funding from this project will transfer to the Maintaining Technology Advantage PE 0605797D8Z, in alignment with the DD, STP&E mission."

            "val": "Mission Description:  The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological contingencies, and protection of the environment.\n\nJustification:  Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10 CFR 20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or who are exposed to radioactive materials in their jobs.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) under the provisions of 10 CFR 20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense, Consequence Management, Training, Technical (RADIAC calibration, shielding evaluation, research, etc.) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction and radiological search missions to locate or intercept WMD).\n\nThis budget item develops, tests and evaluates new, highly reliable, more easily calibrated, easy to care and maintain, light weight and modern RADIAC instruments in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation safety, to make instruments simpler to use, and to reduce life cycle costs.  The ultimate goal is to replace old, bulky, costly to maintain and repair, unreliable and obsolete instrumentation with multifunction equipment that can be automatically calibrated at greatly reduced cost.\n\nThis budget item also provides for improvement to nuclear weapons intrinsic radiation (gamma and neutron) shielding calculations, mixed field (neutron and gamma) dosimetry, and in neutron measurement.  The objective is to develop less costly and more effective integral shielding for better personnel protection and safety.  Improvement in personnel dosimetry and neutron measurement is also a major emphasis."

These instruments are used on all vessels afloat and at every shore installation in order to ensure the safety of personnel and the environment.  RADIACs are also required after an act of terrorism or war that involves nuclear material in order to enable continuation of warfighting ability.\n\nJustification: Many RADIAC instruments and dosimetry systems are decades old and approaching the end of their useful lives.  In some cases the equipment and replacement parts are no longer manufactured, making the equipment logistically unsupportable.  In other cases increasing failure rates due to age make replacements an economic efficiency\nimprovement.  In all cases a technology refresh will make both economic sense in terms of lowering the total ownership costs, and will also provide increased operational capabilities.\n  \nNaval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP):  Instruments are developed to support the safe operation and maintenance of nuclear powered vessels and at nuclear maintenance facilities.\n\nNon-NNPP: Instruments are developed to support other than NNPP end users, such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, Industrial Radiography, Radiological Defense and Training.\n \nVisit, Board, Search & Seizure (VBSS): The Navy has been tasked to intercept and board vessels at sea to search for nuclear or radiological materials that could be used for terrorist attacks. These instruments would have different characteristics than those used for NNPP and non-NNPP purposes and prototypes must be developed and\/or tested and evaluated."

Title 10 CFR 20.1502 states \"Each licensee shall monitor exposures to radiation and radioactive material at levels sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the occupational dose limits.\"  A primary dosimeter must pass accreditation proficiency testing, allowing the reading obtained to become a part of an individual's permanent health record.  This permanent record is used to protect the individual radiation worker's health, and also the Navy from future liability.  The Navy's current primary device is the DT-702\/PD, a passive Thermo Luminescence Dosimeter (TLD).  Existing TLDs and newer technologies, such as Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), must be continually researched to determine on-going performance parameters, cost to field and cost to maintain, since the current system is approaching the end of its useful life and must be replaced by 2030.\n\nA passive device does not provide a display of the dose being received, which can be important in certain circumstances.  The dosimeter instead must be sent to a facility with a special reader to recover the dose, which is then entered in the individual's medical records.  An active device displays the dose digitally in real time, providing immediate feedback in high risk scenarios.  Newer passive-active systems can do both."

In some medical and industrial applications, there is a high risk of such local high exposures due to the handling of sources, working close to a high radiation field, or using\/cleaning high-energy beta emitters. Because of this, the need to accurately measure extremity dose is of significant importance to the Navy. The legacy system currently used for hands and feet dose measurements is RADSTAR. This is an active system (see the Primary Dosimetry Overall Description task for a discussion of passive and active dosimeters), but it is no longer supported by the vendor and must be replaced. \n\nTo that end the ED3 system was procured in FY18 and has been tested and a report rendered on its suitability as a replacement.  This is another active system, but shortfalls noted were that it currently measures only exposure to the hands, and it is too fragile for industrial-type use.  Another active system being considered is the iMUX, which has the advantage of being wireless (the other two require wires that extend from the extremities to a pager-sized device clipped to the belt or worn on the wrist), and is capable of measuring dose at both the hands and feet.\n\nMeasurement of dose at the eyes is currently extrapolated from the Navy's passive primary dosimeter, the DT-702\/PD.  Because eyes are subject to development of cataracts with prolonged or high dose exposure to radiation, a more precise and real time measuring device is being sought in the systems being evaluated."

Such a sensitive mission requires leading edge technology and capabilities to ensure success.  The AN\/PDX-1 RADIAC Set was fielded in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to meet this requirement.  It contains three instruments that serve different purposes: (1) a Handheld Radiation Monitor (HRM)that searches for radiological materials; (2) a Radioisotope Identifier (RID) that identifies the type of radiological material located; and (3) a Personal Radiation Detector (PRD) that displays the radiological dose the VBSS team members may be receiving so that they can be aware if they are being exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity during the mission.  Current technology dictates that the sensitivity of the detectors is directly proportional to the size of the detector element; i.e., the larger the detector, the more sensitive and capable it is.  However, in VBSS there must be a tradeoff between size\/weight and capability, since it is difficult and hazardous for boarding parties to carry a backpack-sized detector, along with their weapons and other gear, up a rope ladder to board a vessel on the high seas.  This will be a continuing effort to find smaller, lighter instruments with enhanced sensitivity, reach-back capability, and other enhancements to provide the Navy the best and most cost effective equipment possible for this mission."

This type of survey meter system is the single most prevalent RADIAC instrument in the Navy inventory, utilized for every Navy end use but predominantly in the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP) and Radiological Defense (RD) end uses. The Joint Product Leader in Radiological Nuclear Defense(JPdl-RND) is currently developing the RDS for use by all the Services.  This joint effort will lower the procurement cost for all and just as significantly, for the first time enable joint interoperability in the Radiological Defense arena.  The Navy's current version of this instrument is the IM-260\/PD Multi-Function RADIAC (MFR), which is 30 years old and nearing the end of its useful life.  Army and Marine Corps use the AN\/PDR-75 system and the Air Force the ADM-300, which are both also decades old and obsolete.\n\nThe NNPP end use is unique amongst the Services, since only the Navy operates nuclear reactors, and while the RDS solution should prove to be sufficient for all the Services for most of their respective applications, Navy must test and evaluate the proposed RDS to ensure the performance and specifications of a Joint solution will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the NNPP application."

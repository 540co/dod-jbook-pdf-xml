The systems engineering effort will define; the requirements for a deployable MOKV, the exit requirements for the technology component and subsystem risk reduction phase; and the entrance criteria for a future development phase.  The Government will develop MOKV system engineering guidelines from industry concepts, government analysis, modeling, and simulation. The MOKV concepts and identified technology component risk reduction will formulate the trade space across cost, risk, and kill vehicle performance to establish requirements that are feasible and affordable for the engineering, manufacturing and development of a future MOKV. MDA anticipates deploying this capability across the interceptor fleet in the next decade to address the evolving threat.\n\nThis capability relies on a BMDS architecture that balances performance across the sensor; Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications; and kill vehicle elements.  Analysis shows that having multiple kill vehicles on each interceptor can dramatically improve the performance of the system, significantly reduce the burden on interceptor inventory, and reduce cost to defend the Homeland.\n\nAs part of MOKV concept development, industry identified technology component risk reduction efforts that support their concepts.  In FY 2018, MDA will continue risk reduction for selected kill vehicle and carrier vehicle component and subsystem technologies that lower development risk, leading to follow-on integrated prototype demonstrations.  MOKV technology risk reduction efforts include engagement management, communications, seekers and advanced sensors, divert attitude and control systems, integrated avionics, and inertial measurement units.\n\nAs part of further enhancing MOKV component risk reduction, kill vehicle and carrier vehicle subsystems will be matured to fully operable prototypes and integrated together to conduct high-fidelity hardware-in-the-loop laboratory demonstrations of performance, functionality and interfaces. \n \nA number of components will be integrated into the kill vehicle prototype demonstrators to show operating functions and performance against simulated threats.  Avionics will demonstrate relevant through put and navigation accuracy.  Seeker telescope and sensor packaging will confirm frame rate speed, and achieve pixel density and sensitivity to acquire and track threat objects.  Communication and antenna packaging will indicate transmission power and receiver sensitivity sufficiency, in conjunction with the viewing angles that will be encountered in an operational environment.  Divert and attitude control system will demonstrate the thrust and divert capabilities that are necessary, in conjunction with seeker packaging and performance, to perform lethal engagements against a designated threat object. \n \nA prototype demonstrator for the carrier vehicle, on which the kill vehicles will reside, will integrate an adjunct seeker telescope and sensor components to show larger format focal plane array sensitivity for object detection.  Communication and real time engagement management operations will be tested to establish capabilities to optimally manage threat object identification and hand off target assignments to the kill vehicles."

Second, conduct risk reduction activities to identify and mature the technology necessary to increase the reliability and performance of our kill vehicles using the Advanced Technology Innovation Broad Agency Announcement and competitive procurements.  Make investments that mitigate the component development gaps for future Multi-Object Kill Vehicles, and enhance the competitive environment.  Make the necessary investments to maturing component technology; enhanced inertial navigation and kill vehicle-to-kill vehicle communications.  Third, leverage the technical expertise of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, University Applied Research Centers, and Universities and government laboratories to independently develop reference concept using proven modeling\/analysis techniques."

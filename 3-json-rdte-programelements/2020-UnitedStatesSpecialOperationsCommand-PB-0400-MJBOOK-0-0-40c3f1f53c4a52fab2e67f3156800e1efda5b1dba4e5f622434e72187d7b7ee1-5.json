            "val": "SF100 Aviation Systems Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF common avionics; Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA) radar, best known as Silent Knight radar or AN\/APQ-187; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser; AC-130H\/W\/U and MC-130E\/H\/P Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.\n\nSF200 CV-22 Development\/Test and Evaluation:\nThe CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF\/TA Silent Knight radar or AN\/APQ-187, provides long-range, night\/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable\/capable replacement to obsolescing and technology limited TF\/TA radar.  There is a plan to develop a Forward Defensive Weapon System (FDWS), which in combination with the ramp-mounted gun, provides a ~360 degree field of fire to suppress\/eliminate enemy targets.  The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the USMC MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar color helmet mounted display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation.\n\nS750 Mission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThe Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, rapid prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. \n\nS875 AC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging\/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Combat Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Combat Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to rapidly prototype and integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following\/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC\/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command\u2019s legacy C-130 fleet.\n\nD615 Rotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique rotary wing aviation and training requirements. This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) avionics and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, address cyber security, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operations at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  When possible, Middle-Tier Acquisition (2016 NDAA Section 804) may also be used to accommodate rapid prototyping in the above projects to develop, demonstrate and evaluate residual operational capabilities."

The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV-22 platform.\n\nCV-22 SOF Common Terrain Following Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA) (Silent Knight) Radar: Provides long-range, night\/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas for infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of SOF forces. This more sustainable and capable radar replaces the obsolescing APQ-186 terrain following\/avoidance radar currently integrated on CV-22 aircraft.\n\nBlock 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform. \nIncluded within Block 20, but not limited to, is the Forward Defensive Weapon System (FDWS). FDWS provides the CV-22 with the capability to suppress threats in the forward hemisphere while the aircraft is in the critical phase of landing and takeoff at the mission objective. The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the USMC MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar color helmet mounted display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation."

The acquisition strategy for the CV-22 SF Common TF\/TA (Silent Knight) radar program is to procure radar units and radar software modifications through the USSOCOM (Silent Knight) radar Program Management Office, integrate (Silent Knight) radar into CV-22 aircraft, and buy aircraft modification kits, using a mixture of both sole source and competitive contracts.\n\nThe Block 20 Forward Defensive Weapon System (FDWS) will be based on modifications to the DWS currently fielded on USMC MV-22 aircraft and previously tested on a CV-22. These modifications will integrate the DWS with the CV-22 pilots\u2019 helmet mounted displays and cockpit controls to correct deficiencies\/improve system effectiveness and will award a competitive EMD contract for development."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following\/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC\/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command\u2019s legacy C-130 fleet."

This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) avionics and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, address cyber security, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operations at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  When possible, Middle-Tier Acquisition (2016 NDAA Section 804) may be used to accommodate rapid prototyping in the above projects to develop, demonstrate and evaluate residual operational capabilities."

An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrew and operators necessary to support time-sensitive mission requirements. This upgrade is critical to keeping the A\/MH-6M aircraft operational beyond FY 2020 and until a suitable replacement aircraft is available. The non-recurring effort provides development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data collection to support issuance of government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications."

The airframe efforts (new rotor blades\/flight control kits and new shells) will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframes.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item\/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022 MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on MH-60M helicopters.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022 DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in DVE.  A competitive source selection process was conducted, resulting in down-selection of one vendor for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time \u201csee through\u201d imagery and visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  \n\n\u2022 FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years. \n\n\u2022 IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A\/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Department of Navy IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The government will integrate the systems onto the A\/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.  Will begin evaluation and qualification of an infrared exhaust suppressor for the A\/MH-6M aircraft.   \n\n\u2022 MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications consist mostly of government and contractor executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.\n\n\u2022 MPU provides for future cockpit architecture studies that will help define the replacement of current mission and video processors for all ARSOA platforms.  Additionally it will address near term required upgrades to existing components.  Potential upgrades will be through existing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), while the future cockpit architecture studies will be competitively awarded.\n\n\u2022 The ASE Upgrades program develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements\/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment and flares.   For new systems, other services\u2019 development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the OEM."

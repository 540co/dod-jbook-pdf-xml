            "val": "This program funds design, development and test of primary target acquisition and counterfire radars to automatically detect, locate and classify hostile indirect fire weapons (mortars, artillery, and rockets).  The program directly supports the prioritization, tracking and locating of targets, and dissemination of that information for simultaneous attack of multiple threats.  It provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counterfire target acquisition systems for all types and phases of military operations. Project L86, Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), version AN\/TPQ-50 provides 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers. The AN\/TPQ-50 and AN\/TPQ-53 radars are currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include operational support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).  \n\nThis program line also funds the Hypervelocity Projectile System (HVP) a next-generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectile capable of completing multiple missions across different gun systems. HVP\u2019s low drag aerodynamic design enables high-velocity, maneuverability and decreased time-to-target. These attributes coupled with accurate guidance electronics provide low-cost mission effectiveness against current threats and the ability to adapt to air and surface threats of the future. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow targeting of moving and relocatable surface targets beyond the range of conventional artillery as well as live fire intercepts of cruise and ballistic targets. Current estimates for a follow on development effort achieve an integrated system solution by FY22.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2018 Base funding in the amount of $36.000 million will support the initiation of contract requirements package development, system evaluation, requirements\/specification work, integration development and test plans for the Hypervelocity Projectile system. The Army will leverage Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) prototypes to transition this new start capability into a program of record.\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Base funding in the amount of  $9.605 million will support ongoing AN\/TPQ-53 test efforts and Army interoperability certifications (AICs), AN\/TPQ-50 and AN\/TPQ-53 development and testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats, and the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation."

The AN\/TPQ-50 system interoperates with battle command systems (BCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN\/TPQ-50 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN\/TPQ-50 is currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) funds of $2.136 million will support the work required to enhance the AN\/TPQ-50's capability to address electronic protection against CEMA and other known, new, emerging and evolving threats identified in the System Threat Assessment Report (STAR). This effort also continues to improve detection, tracking and location accuracy as well as reduce false location rate against new threats to the warfighter. Funding also supports the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction efforts and required documentation as well as associated testing costs and program support."

These attributes coupled with accurate guidance electronics provide low-cost mission effectiveness against current threats and the ability to adapt to air and surface threats of the future. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow targeting of moving and relocatable surface targets beyond the range of conventional artillery as well as live fire intercepts of cruise and ballistic targets. Current estimates for a follow on development effort achieve an integrated system solution by FY22. \n\nJustification: FY2018 Base funding in the amount of $36.000 million supports the initiation of contract requirements package development, system evaluation, requirements\/specification work, integration development and test plans. The Army will leverage Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) prototypes to transition this new start capability into a program of record. This is a New Start."

It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) and will ultimately replace the current AN\/TPQ-36 and AN\/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars.  The AN\/TPQ-53 system interoperates with battle command systems (BCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN\/TPQ-53 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN\/TPQ-53 is fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 funds of $7.469 million will support ongoing test efforts, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), development and testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats, and the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation."

In 2006, the Government awarded a contract following full and open competition for the design of the AN\/TPQ-53 radar and the purchase of four non-recurring engineering (NRE) radars.  Twelve additional quick reaction capability (QRC) radars were purchased under the same contract in response to an urgent directed procurement in July 2008.  The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the acquisition of up to 20 more QRC radars.  Twenty systems were procured through two separate contract actions in 2010 and 2011.  A competitive production contract for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems was awarded in 2012 and options for additional systems were awarded in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  Production and delivery of all QRC\/Initial Production (IP) systems are complete, and production of LRIP systems is ongoing.  A Full Rate Production (FRP) decision was obtained in December 2015.  The FRP contract to fill the remainder of the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) was awarded in March 2017.  Additionally, all initial production systems will be retrofitted to the FRP configuration.  The FRP system deliveries will continue through fiscal year (FY) 2021.  The system will eventually replace all of the AN\/TPQ-36 and AN\/TPQ-37 systems in the fleet.\n\nThe FY 2018 funds of $7.469 million will support ongoing test efforts, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), development and testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats, and the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation."

The F\/A-18 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the structural and subsystem conditions of the F\/A-18 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft designed life limits to allow it to achieve Chief of Naval Operations inventory requirements.  Without SLAP and the follow on Service Life Extension Program, aircraft are retired from the USN inventory when a design service life metric is reached.  RDTE funds will support aircraft teardown to validate SLAP analysis, identify unknown fatigue areas and assess the aircraft's material condition.  \n \n3182: The T-45 SLAP is assessing the subsystem condition of the T-45 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft subsystem design life limits to allow it to meet Chief of Naval Air Training Pilot and Naval Flight Officer training requirements through 2035.  \n\n3384: The MH-60 SLAP is assessing the primary aircraft structure and subsystem condition of the MH-60S fleet in order to determine what efforts are necessary to extend the aircraft design life limits to allow it to meet Chief of Naval Operations operational inventory requirements through FY 2035.  Without SLAP, aircraft are retired from the USN inventory when design service life limits are reached directly impacting fleet surface warfare, mine countermeasures, search and rescue, and vertical replenishment operational capabilities.  FY 2018 budget request funds for the completion of external loads analysis, continuation of fatigue analysis, service life risk assessments of aircraft subsystems analysis and development of initial dispositions for safety critical items.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The goal of the F\/A-18 SLAP program is to identify critical structures and components that can achieve the extended service life limit goals.  SLAP consists of structural investigations of the main landing gear, arresting hook and catapult back-up structures, vertical tails, wings and fuselage. A second effort is to evaluate the subsystem components (hydraulics, wiring, actuators, etc) to identify over and above inspections, overhaul intervals or replacement schedules to fly past design of 6,000 hours.  The current life limits for the F\/A-18 E\/F are 6,000 Flight Hours (FH), 2,250 catapults\/arrestments (Cat\/Traps) and 15,750 total landings. The F\/A-18 SLAP program of record states the SLAP goals as 12,000 FH, 3,500 Cat\/Traps and 22,500 total landings. The primary objective of F\/A-18 SLAP is to determine if the stated SLAP goals are feasible. An increase in total landings and flight hours would allow the F\/A-18 to meet CNO inventory requirements.  The requirements are integrated with the Joint Strike Fighter planned introduction.  This effort is required to be conducted for these airframes and subsystems to ascertain what actions and modifications must be taken to safely operate each system beyond its designed life until the targeted end of service life."

These efforts will provide the raw engineering data to develop aircraft modifications to extend total aircraft landings, Cat\/Traps, and FH.  The F\/A-18 SLAP Program consists of two major engineering efforts: the aircraft structural assessment and the aircraft subsystems assessment.  Both efforts are broken into multiple phases which develop tools and models, evaluate current aircraft usage, and develop concepts to extend aircraft life to meet CNO objectives.  The program will combine exploitation of complete structural fatigue testing and actual fleet usage with the expectation of extending the service life of the F\/A-18 aircraft.  Conducting F\/A-18 SLAP to study the aircraft lifetime will provide a better estimate of aircraft service life and a follow on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP)."

During SLAP Structures Phase B (FY11-FY18) specific structural locations which do not meet SLAP goals are identified and evaluated.  Subsystem SLAP is also initiated concurrently with Structures Phase (B).  A Flight Control Surface SLAP, SLEP retrofit concepts and repairs for deficient locations are developed during SLAP Structures and Sub-Systems Phase C (FY14-FY22).

This service life limit prevents the T-45 fleet from meeting Integrated Production Plan (IPP), previously Pilot Training Requirements, past 2025. Recent studies have determined that the fleet squadrons have not been flying the T-45 aircraft as aggressively as the initial fatigue studies predicted. These studies demonstrate that the 14,400 flight hour service life can likely be extended, with a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), to 21,600 flight hours, which will support meeting IPP until 2035. A T-45 Structural Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) was completed in February 2012. The results are being used to provide guidance on what structural areas to SLEP. In order for the T-45 to meet IPP until 2035, it is also necessary to assess the subsystems of the T-45 in their ability to remain viable. Beginning in FY13, the T-45 subsystem SLAP effort assessed the subsystem condition of the T-45 fleet in order to determine subsystem modifications and\/or redesign necessary to extend the aircraft designed service life to support IPP and Naval Flight Officer Training Requirements (NTR) until 2035. This subsystem assessment was based on the updated fleet aircraft usage spectrum and future predicted training missions of the T-45 aircraft. The assessment addressed all critical subsystems required and their ability to maintain IPP\/NTR until 2035, analysis and studies will be conducted to outline improvements, assess manufacturing capabilities, prototype redesign and test of subsystems for trainer aircraft. The original funding within the T-45 SLAP budget programmed for T-45 tail hook has been absorbed into the overarching SLAP effort due to the success of T-45 additional tail hook life extension efforts."

The highest flight time MH-60S helicopters are expected to exceed the currently assumed design life limit of 10,000 flight hours in 2025, at which time as many as 30 aircraft per year could be downed without a SLAP and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) established in FY 2018.  The MH-60S has experienced significant structural issues since Initial Operational Capability in August 2002, resulting in downed aircraft and additional inspections for the operational fleet.  Similar issues could very well precede the 10,000 flight hour life limit, particularly without the insight provided by a SLAP effort commenced as soon as possible.  The goal of the MH-60S SLAP program is to identify critical structures, components, and subsystems that can achieve the extended service life limit goals. The initial efforts of the MH-60S SLAP is to assess the primary aircraft structure and subsystem condition of the MH-60S fleet in order to determine what efforts are necessary to validate the currently assumed design life limit of 10,000 hours and potentially extend the aircraft life limit.  The MH-60 SLAP is comprised of three distinct assessments: Fatigue Life Assessment (FLA),which will establish the fatigue life of the aircraft and air vehicle systems;  Subsystem Life Assessment (SLA), which will determine subsystem components that are critical to safe flight and ground operations and identify safety risk and risk mitigation strategies for critical components; and the Dynamic Component Re-life Assessment (DRLA), which recalculates and establishes life limits for preselected MH-60 dynamic components.  FLA consists of structural investigations of the cockpit beams, main gearbox beams\/frames, upper deck, engine mount, lower tub, main landing gear, tail landing gear, cargo hook, transition splice and tie-down fittings\/structure, tailcone, tail gearbox, intermediate gearbox, stabilator, manufactured joints\/splices, and flight controls support structure. SLA will evaluate engine start and engine inlet anti-ice, rotor brake, hydraulic, flight controls, etc, to identify over-and-above inspections, overhaul intervals or replacement schedules to fly beyond the current design limit assumption. FY 2018 budget request funds the completion of external loads analysis, continuation of fatigue analysis, service life risk assessments of aircraft subsystems, and development of initial dispositions for safety critical items.  This initial analysis, assessment and disposition will be further refined throughout the SLAP effort, augmented with specific system teardown, inspection and test, culminating in a follow-on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which will design and implement the solutions resulting from the SLAP findings."

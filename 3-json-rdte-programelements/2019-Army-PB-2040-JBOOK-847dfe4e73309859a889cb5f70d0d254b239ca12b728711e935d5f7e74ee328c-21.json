                            "val": "This Project matures and demonstrates software and architectures for geospatial mapping applications and decision aids for the Warfighter. Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops and critical fixed and semi-fixed assets. Protection measures support force projection in areas such as air and sea ports of debarkation, dispersed small units, and units operating in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations and future vertical lift. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. \n\nForce protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating in disbursed small units over complex and urban terrain and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blast and weapon effects from advanced and emerging threats. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply and manned-unmanned teaming and demonstrates infrastructure health monitoring assessment technologies to support emerging projection challenges in complex, contested environments such as distributed sustainment over large distances. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for \"upfront engineering\" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization priorities for Next Generation Combat Vehicle, Air Missile Defense, Network\/C3I, and Future Vertical Lift. This work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832\/Project D8Z.\n\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology).

The continually expanding portfolio of enterprise services supports 100 percent of the active duty military and Government civilians; 258 thousand embedded contract personnel; 75 percent of the active Guard and Reserve; and 25 percent of the Guard and Reserve users. This meets the Department\u2019s requirement to support 2.5 million users on the Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) Internet Protocol (IP) Data network and 300 thousand users on the Secret IP Data network. The portfolio of services continues to expand through the transition of local services to the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise and providing enhanced functionality that allows DoD personnel to go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive, the implementation of an access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing throughout the DoD, and the integration of pre-planned product improvements to existing enterprise services keeping them relevant to the end-users\u2019 missions."

Critical warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services within the portfolio include an enterprise collaboration capability supporting over 900,000 DoD users, Enterprise Search that exposes data sources throughout the DoD, Service Oriented Architecture Foundation supporting a robust Enterprise Messaging service that provides producers the ability to publish one message that, in turn, can be distributed to hundreds of end-points supporting the subscribers to that information and a critical enterprise authoritative data source service that supports the user\u2019s need to identify and use authoritative data and services. The portfolio also includes the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb) providing decision and event management support to all levels of a widespread user-base that ranges from the Combatant Commanders to the Joint Staff to Coalition partners on the Secret Internet Protocol (IP) Data network; DoD Visitor that allows personnel to \u201cgo anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive;\u201d the DoD Enterprise Portal Service that provides users with a flexible web-based hosting solution to create and manage mission, community, organization, and user focused sites; and privilege management Authentication Gateway Services (AGS) that is integrated with the Identity and Access Management services supporting brokered Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication for DoD applications without a native PKI authentication capability. The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs. This flexibility provides unprecedented access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information, and temporarily stores critical data in a secure environment. The portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by US Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations. These enabling benefits include the ability to:\n\u2022\tEnhance collaborative decision-making processes\n\u2022\tImprove information sharing and integrated situational awareness\n\u2022\tShare and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands\n\u2022\tShare and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources\n\u2022\tSchedule and coordinate meetings with people across the DoD Components\n\u2022\t\u201cGo anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive\u201d\n\u2022\tCreate and manage mission, community, organization, and user-focused sites from global locations\n\u2022\tExchange knowledge to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and accurately assess the effects of that action\nThe portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric Enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and Coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations."

Based on the approved NCES acquisition strategy, the portfolio will adopt proven specifications, best practices, and interface definitions to adopt or buy new network-based services or applications that are delivered, hosted, and managed in accordance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and that ensure available, reliable, and survivable services to support the warfighter\u2019s mission.\nThe portfolio is using a streamlined acquisition approach to ensure that the required acquisitions contain only those requirements that are essential to meet the warfighter mission and that they can be acquired in a cost effective and time constrained manner that meets the defined mission need. This strategy will enable the rapid fielding of low to moderate risk capabilities to meet end-user operational needs through an agile requirements collection and engineering process that supports the acquisition, testing, and fielding of needed requirements in minimum time. The benefits provided by this acquisition approach include:\n\u2022\tSatisfy time-urgent needs of the warfighter or theater commander\n\u2022\tProvide early and continual involvement of the user\n\u2022\tEvaluate the portfolio to determine optimum funding approach to rapidly deploy urgently needed services within the funding profile\n\u2022\tEffective control processes that lower cost and maintains schedule\n\u2022\tProvide multiple, rapidly executed increments or releases of capability\n\u2022\tEarly dialogue between the requirements and acquisition communities to expedite technical, programmatic, and financial solutions\n\u2022\tEnable \u201cinsight\u201d not \u201coversight\u201d to identify and resolve problems early and ensure both the acquisition process and deployed service meets \n                     performance goals\n\u2022\tEnable agility in selecting modular, open-systems approach\nThis business strategy will strike a balance between ensuring accountability using acquisition best practices and deploying urgently needed services to the warfighter on a schedule that will support their mission requirements. The goal is to facilitate the DoD enterprise cloud vision where users and Programs of Record easily access enterprise services from maritime, airborne, and land-based locations worldwide through a federation of core data centers. The user community will guide how the portfolio of services must evolve to remain relevant to the Warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area mission requirements. By partnering with the DoD Components and Mission Areas, the Defense Information Systems Agency will rapidly deliver functionality and capability at the lowest possible cost and risk in the shortest possible timeframe."

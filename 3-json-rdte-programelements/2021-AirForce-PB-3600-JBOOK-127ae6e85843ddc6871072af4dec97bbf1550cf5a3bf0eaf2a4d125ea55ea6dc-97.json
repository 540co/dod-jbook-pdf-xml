For Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), the law requires IOT&E be completed under realistic operating conditions before proceeding beyond LRIP. IOT&E will be planned to answer all critical operational issues (COI) as thoroughly as possible. IOT&E is conducted to determine the operational effectiveness and suitability and resolve overall mission capability of systems undergoing research and development (R&D) efforts. It is an evaluation of a system's performance when the complete system is tested and evaluated against operational criteria by personnel with the same qualifications as those who will operate, maintain and support the system when deployed. In general, IOT&E is performed on new systems in development, major modifications, and other systems as directed. This PE funds the Air Force Operational Test Agency's participation in Integrated Test and Evaluation (IT&E), Multiservice Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) when it is the continuation of IOT&E activities past the full rate production decision. FOT&E answers specific questions about unresolved COIs and test issues or completes areas not finished during the IOT&E. This PE also funds related operational test and evaluation (OT&E) activities such as Early Influence, Operational Utility Evaluations (OUE), Early Operational Assessments (EOA), and Operational Assessments (OA) which are independent OT&Es supporting major milestones and decision points prior to Milestone C, full rate production, fielding, or declaration of IOC. IOT&E programs are identified in several system categories: Air; Space; Weapons; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Combat Support. This program element is driven by Congressional and DoD acquisition mandated requirements for operational testing. AFOTEC schedules and executes tests according to the forecasted test readiness of the MDAP program offices.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

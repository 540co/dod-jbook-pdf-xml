This is accomplished by partnering with existing IC POR to incorporate SOF mission requirements into current and developing technologies and assets.  This leveraging of funds increases national and commercial systems awareness, demonstrates the tactical utility of national systems and commercial data, tests technologies and evaluates operational concepts in biennial Joint Staff Special Projects, and allows for the transition of promising concepts and technologies to other SOF program offices for execution.\n\n\u2022  JTWS is a SoS leveraging commercial technologies and partnerships with other government agencies.  The POR will identify Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)\/Government Off The Shelf capabilities requiring minimal modifications and only use new development when necessary. JTWS will address the continuously evolving threat environments on the Ground, Air, Maritime, and Unmanned Aircraft System variants, leverage existing partnerships with the National Security Agency and other government partners to integrate and sustain systems based on prioritized need from the Components and as emerging threats require technology modernizations.  Additionally, the POR will work to find common solutions across the variants and increase interoperability in order to reduce duplication of efforts.  The contracting strategy is a mixture of full and open competition for prime integrators and leveraging existing Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for COTS procurement.\n\n\u2022   HF-TTL utilizes a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide highly sophisticated TTL and close target audio\/video devices capable of operating in various environments as needed to meet SOF operational requirements. Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, device level modifications, integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.  \n\n\u2022  TVS\/RSTA employs an evolutionary strategy to incorporate the latest state of technology within its product line to provide upgraded next-generation technology insertion of COTS systems and address the changing threat environment to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations. \n\n\u2022   SOFPREP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.\n\n\u2022   ISP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.\n\n\u2022   SSE uses a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide next-generation technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities supporting SOF exploitation mission requirements.

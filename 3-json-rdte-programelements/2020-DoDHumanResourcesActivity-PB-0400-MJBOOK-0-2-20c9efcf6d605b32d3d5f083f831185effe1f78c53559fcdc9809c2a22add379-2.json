Thus, DEOMI's mission is to develop and deliver world-class human relations education, training, research and innovative solutions to enhance total force readiness.  This is accomplished through testing, evaluation, and transition of new technologies to enhance human relations performance. Development and dissemination of research, training resources, and other human relations job-aids and information materials for commanders, service members, and civilians, enhancing their human relations acumen and leadership.\n\nThe emerging spectrum of human relations requirements DEOMI was tasked to address are expanding and RDT&E funds are critical to supporting the DoD strategy for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and to support the\nDepartment's strategy for Diversity and Inclusion. Fundamental research and development is also needed to support policy, training, and programs related to the prevention of hazing, bullying, and all forms of harassment. Adequate RDT&E will allow DEOMI to be a force multiplier for the DoD."

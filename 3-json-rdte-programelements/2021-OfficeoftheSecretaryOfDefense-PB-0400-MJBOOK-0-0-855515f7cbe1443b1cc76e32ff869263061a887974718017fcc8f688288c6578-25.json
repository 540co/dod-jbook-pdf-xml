The new PE will continue to leverage the year of execution processes that have allowed ECTD to rapidly and effectively develop and transition capabilities to respond to emergent issues, time-sensitive threats, and innovation opportunities.  Through consolidation, the DM&P PE increases the Department\u2019s ability to coordinate activities across the Services and Defense Agencies, reduces duplication of effort, enables rapid pivots to new threats, and provides the resources necessary to ensure a technological overmatch against future threats.  This realignment directly supports the Department\u2019s modernization plans by streamlining investments, reducing the time from discovery to deployment, and enabling development of disruptive technologies to help realize the National Defense Strategy.   \n\nEmerging Capabilities Technology Development funds rapid prototyping efforts and experimentation in collaboration with the Services, government labs, academia, allied partner nations, and industry to support the National Defense Strategy, Joint Staff, DoD modernization priorities, and Combatant Command (CCMD) needs.  Completed ECTD projects transition to joint programs through fielded operationally relevant prototypes; technology adoption into programs of record; integration into system level, multi-year joint demonstrations; and through advanced research and engineering efforts like the Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund for further development of tactics, techniques, procedures, and concepts of operations.  Previously selected ECTD projects have been accelerated to complete in FY 2020 or will transition to Program Element 0603338D8Z in FY 2021."

            "val": "In alignment with the National Defense Strategy, the Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element (PE) supports the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) with experimentation and mid-term, mission-focused capability development that crosses functional domains and enhances warfighter lethality, technical superiority, adaptability, and resilience.  ECTD funding supports joint prototype development, joint experimentation for concept of operations (CONOPs) development, and red teaming validations that enable disruptive innovation to sustain the United States' operational superiority.  Joint demonstrations and ECTD-sponsored venues of defense-wide experiments provide opportunities for emerging technologies to succeed, or fail fast.  Demonstration venues include: Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, a multi-domain venue focused on small and non-traditional businesses; Silent Hammer, an advanced electronic warfare venue; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  The red teaming funding line explores vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and enables USD(R&E), and the broader defense science and technology community, to make informed decisions before investing in new capabilities.  Red teaming enables adaptation to unforeseen vulnerabilities or opportunities early in capability development when design changes are cost effective and programs can be re-directed if developmental dead ends are discovered.  ECTD prototypes, demonstrations, experimentations, and red teaming validations enable developers to showcase new and maturing capabilities in realistic environments and against realistic threats with operational user involvement.\n\nECTD prototyping projects increase the speed of technology innovation by reducing technology risk for emerging capabilities.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman\u2019s Capability Gap Assessment, and Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities."

The project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats prior to full funding commitments.  The Red Teaming project supports three broad types of red teaming: 1) Early stage horizon scanning and assessments of weaknesses and opportunities of pre-development technologies from an adversary perspective; 2) Targeted, low-fidelity prototypes to assess utility and inform design choices prior to funding commitments; and 3) Red teams, war games, and field experiments with maturing technology to understand how to implement new technologies and adapt to adversary responses.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of other defense red teaming organizations within the Department, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia.  Deliverables will inform requirements, new concepts of operations (CONOPS), and help accelerate technology acquisition pathways for joint missions."

Efforts include: 1) Early investigations and red teaming to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities and opportunities from emerging and conceptual technologies.  Projects will help define and anticipate impacts from new technologies, including current DoD investments and external technologies, to understand operational utility and identify threats from tangentially related sectors that can have significant negative impacts on current DoD investments.  2) Maturation of Service and Defense Agency identified prototypes to enable red teaming, demonstrations, experiments, and CONOPS earlier in the development cycle.  These prototypes increase agility and rate of innovation for emerging capabilities, while reducing cost and risk.  3) Exploring unconventional approaches to counter current DoD and adversary technologies through red teams, war games, simulation exercises, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines.  Red teaming events range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants.  Deliverables include characterizations of future prototypes, requirement definitions, recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures that could be taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The USD(R&E) will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new CONOPS.\n\nIn FY 2019, red teaming efforts were conducted to support the National Defense Strategy\u2019s priority for increased lethality and the Department of Defense\u2019s modernization priorities for cyber and artificial intelligence\/machine learning.  An early stage investigation was conducted to explore inherent vulnerabilities in a conceptual, pre-development technology prior to full funding commitments.  A prototype was developed and assessed for utility by an associated red teaming event with operationally-experienced participants.  Maturing technologies were red teamed to, either understand how best to implement and adapt the technology into CONOPS, or determine how best to counter adversary responses to the technology.  Additional details are classified."

Potential projects include assessments and demonstrations of electronic warfare capabilities and weaknesses; operations with high-bandwidth over-the-horizon networked communications; emerging near-peer counters in the areas of fully networked, smart devices; quantum sensors; and other potential counters to future U.S. technology investments.  Project selection will be guided by the National Defense Strategy, and priorities and gaps identified by the Department, Combatant Commands, Services, other government organizations, FFRDCs, academia, and industry as new threats emerge or new opportunities are presented.

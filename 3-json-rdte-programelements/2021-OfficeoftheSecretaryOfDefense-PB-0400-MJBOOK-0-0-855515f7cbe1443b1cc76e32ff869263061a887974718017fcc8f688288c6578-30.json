The new PE will continue to leverage the year of execution processes that allow QRSP to rapidly develop relatively low cost, risk reducing prototypes for potentially high payoff opportunities.  Through consolidation, the PE increases the Department\u2019s ability to coordinate activities across the Services and Defense Agencies, removes duplication of effort, enables rapid pivots to new threats, and provides the resources necessary to ensure technological overmatch against future threats.  This realignment directly supports the Department\u2019s modernization plans by streamlining investments, reducing the time from discovery to deployment, and enabling development of disruptive technologies to help realize the National Defense Strategy.\n\nFunding in the QRSP PE enables leadership within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) to leverage rapidly maturing technologies from small and non-traditional businesses within the year of execution and incubate them to potentially game-changing capabilities.  Through streamlined processes, QRSP captures emergent opportunities and addresses time sensitive mission threats through low cost, higher-risk prototypes.\n\nIn FY 2020, the Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) within the QRSP PE was transferred to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development to support the priorities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)).  Additionally, in FY 2020 the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell Support (JRAC) was transferred to PE 0903399D8Z within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment for alignment and execution.  To support the transition of JRAC to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, previously appropriated funding for JRAC is displayed within the Rapid Reaction Fund."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element (PE) funds the development of risk-reducing prototypes and accelerates capability innovation to deliver performance to the joint warfighter at the speed of relevance.  QRSP prototypes increase warfighter lethality, affordably counter emerging technological threats, and help address the immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman\u2019s Capability Gap Assessment, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) modernization priorities, and the CCMD\u2019s Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).\n\nThe QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA).  Efforts within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, address challenges identified in the National Defense Strategy, and support the DoD\u2019s modernization priorities. Funding and activities within QRF transferred to other Program Elements in FY 2020.\n\nRRF develops prototypes to counter emerging threats; anticipates adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies; and, expedites delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives accelerate innovation by rapidly developing high-risk prototypes with the potential for immediate and impactful transition of warfighter capabilities.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as machine learning algorithms and software intelligence, to enable novel prototypes with agile technology insertion paths.  Funded projects also leverage existing capabilities from the traditional industrial base and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      \n\nSMA supports senior leadership within the CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  The Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO) sets priorities for SMA programs.  SMA products are typically generated within six to nine months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership."

The project successfully validated aerodynamic design with wind tunnel testing and integrated a guidance subsystem for targeted kinetic effects before culminating in a FY 2019 flight test.  Documentation and prototype technologies transitioned to the U.S. Army for additional development and follow-on acquisition activities.   \n\u2022 Dead Center demonstrated advanced, highly tailorable algorithms to meet critical warfighter mission needs in multiple domains, culminating in a user demonstration of the advanced algorithms designed to enhance warfighter effectiveness.  The project integrated these algorithms with repurposed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware to demonstrate a flexible, multi-platform functionality in a low size, weight, and power form factor to meet specific, highly tailored mission critical needs.  Project deliverables, including prototypes and system documentation, transitioned to a classified DoD partner.\n\u2022 Battle Axe was a nine-month effort that leveraged several existing, high technology readiness level (TRL) technologies and developed a new, electronic-attack (EA) capability.  The prototype provided a rapidly deployable, low size, weight, power, and cost counter intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) solution to the warfighter.  Further details of this project are classified.\n\u2022 Olympus focused on the development of fully customizable cyber tools for open network exploitation to enhance the CCMDs\u2019 capability to operate and exploit cyber information in near real-time.

These problems will be in direct support of CCMD senior leadership and may include areas such as: counter terrorism; transnational criminal organizations; counter weapons of mass destruction (state and non-state); counter global or regional social and cultural assessments; regional stability assessments; and, individual state or national level deterrence studies.  Specifically for FY 2020, SMA will conduct an assessment entitled \"Competition & Conflict Dynamics Incubator in the Eurasian Landmass.\"  SMA proposes to establish a testbed (or incubator) to study changing regional dynamics amidst increasing great power competition.  These include anticipated trajectories of state and non-state factors inherent to the region of concern as well as potential black swan scenarios that could greatly alter the balances of both hard and soft power in the Central Region in ways detrimental to key U.S. interests.\n\nTo accomplish this effort, SMA will leverage a highly effective and expansive virtual network of globally placed SMEs using relationships with numerous agencies and organizations, including Military Departments\/Services, DoD analysis centers, other U.S. Government departments and agencies, the private sector, academia, and partner nation governments.  Structured interviews, literature reviews, original research, modeling and simulation, and gaming are all ways that SMA gathers input for their products.  The input is then curated and goes through several rounds of coordination that includes a Senior Review Group (SRG) before completion."

Army watercraft equipment enables the conduct of riverine, Logistics-over-the-Shore (LOTS) and Joint Logistics-over-the-Shore (JLOTS), inter and intra-theater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and it's major components).  Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and\/or denied access scenarios.  The Army uses a spectrum of Army Watercraft systems, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intra-theater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to oceangoing and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port\/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems for (LOTS\/JLOTS).  The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, energy efficiency, environmental, regulatory compliance and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will address critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies in a manner to support future acquisitions and future fleet planning.  The funding enables our compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.\n\nFY18 funding will primarily support maturation of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) design for the Modular Warping Tug (MWT), support continued integration of Force Protection, and environmental projects."

It supports initiatives that are essential to the development and fielding of modernized TEP sources from Watts to Megawatts level that comply with environmental statues and provide noise and signature-suppressed, energy-efficient, lightweight, deployable and reliable equipment.  FY18 funding will support test and evaluation of technologies for Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP), Platoon Power Generation (PPG), Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (MEHPS), and Management and Distribution Control (MDC).  Also, funding will support a holistic Modeling and Simulation approach to the evaluation of Operational Energy (OE)-related impacts, systems, and improvements; with the vision of reducing Army energy dependency and demand, increasing systems and contingency bases energy efficiency, seeking alternative energy sources and supporting a culture of energy responsibility while sustaining or enhancing operational capabilities.  This includes support of the Joint Operational Energy Initiative (JOEI).  Out years will support investigation of general advancements in engine, power equipment, energy storage, renewable\/alternative energy, and power distribution equipment that are applicable to current equipment and emerging requirements.  In addition, an extensive analysis of commercial generator technology is planned to support requirements definition for the next family of tactical sets.  Programs include costs for developing concept hardware and executing system evaluations at the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events at Ft. Bliss."

The Technology Development programs support the development and enhancement of rapidly deployable Petroleum and Water equipment.  The mission includes developing fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; alternative source water acquisition, reutilization and disposal systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; water purification and waste water treatment and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the Army with the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield."

JBC-P enables Joint, Net-Centric C2\/Battle Command by seamlessly passing\/sharing relevant information vertically and horizontally, within all tactical levels of command and control. JBC-P is designed to be used on L-Band Satellite Networks and terrestrial radios.\n\nPdM JBC-P, under PM Mission Command (MC), is collaborating with the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center's (CERDEC) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) on evolving BFT network. Systems engineering studies\/planning activities are underway to develop the evolution path of the BFT network. In addition, there are two RDT&E contractual efforts underway for FY 2018 and FY 2019 that will aid in assessing the feasibility of reusing existing BFT-2 transceivers (hardware) and replacing them with advanced, government owned hardware\/software. The goal is to have a BFT-3, full and open solicitation to industry, ready for FY 2020.  \n\nTo better understand how potential changes to the BFT network would affect overall operations, S&TCD is working on developing a model of the current BFT-2 waveform to test in the BFT portion of their Network Test Lab. This Test Lab provides the Government the ability to test proposed fixes, conduct regression testing of future Software and Firmware releases, and replicate any problems the system may experience without impacting the operational network.\n\nFORSCOM users have identified a need for an expeditionary JBC-P capability to better connect the Lower Tactical Internet (LTI) to the BFT network when dismounted.  PdM JBC-P has partnered with CERDEC's Command, Power and Integration Directorate to develop the capability."

The IOT&E tested the JBC-P system software on existing FBCB2 hardware (non-dismountable vehicle systems) and future production-representative hardware. On completion of Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC), MDA authorized Full Rate Production (FRP) in 1QFY2014. First unit equipped (FUE) was successfully conducted 3QFY2015.\n\nDevelopmental efforts are being performed through intra-government collaboration.  System engineering efforts are being performed by CERDEC's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD); Command, Power and Integration (CP&I) & the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD). Hardware along with fielding, training and field support efforts are obtained through existing competitively awarded contracts."

DoD assumed modernization efforts beginning in FY 2017, as decided by the Interagency Deputies Committee and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Funds support the development, sustainment, technical refresh of hardware and software, Cloud migration, and program management costs to develop and field a modernized Federal Investigation System. This modernized capability's data architecture will leverage and extend the existing secure Information Technology capabilities inherent to DoD infrastructure to the federal wide background investigation processes and data archives. This approach will provide essential security of this information and in turn protect the identities, lives, and livelihoods of these people, and the family members and associates identified as part of these records. The aim is to avert or eliminate the continuous and dynamic threat of identity theft, financial espionage and other attacks on this personal information, while providing a secure basis for background investigations necessary to Federal and DoD operations.\nUsing proven data architecture and identifiable security, DCSA will leverage critical and inherent information technology (IT) security capabilities; identify means and methods to efficiently and securely access digital services; enhance systems necessary to operate the background investigation processes and associated vast reservoirs of data and interfaces; provide Government-wide tools to assist agencies with workforce management; and, develop and provide investigative products that comply with the new, Federal Investigations Standards and Workforce 2.0. Resources will be used to implement and sustain agency network upgrades and security software maintenance to ensure a stronger, more reliable, and better protected network architecture for conducting background investigations. Costs include program management activities, payroll for security specialists, engineers, data architects, and business process management activities to develop, test, and deploy the new capability. As capabilities are fielded NBIS and DCSA will provide system maintenance, security licenses and operational support to the system and users worldwide."

Finally, in FY2021 NBIS will pay any residual moving costs required for the transition from the DISA campus to a DCSA facility.

As part of an Agile development process, the National Background Investigation System (NBIS) will deploy additional releases in FY21 to improve automation of the background investigation process, improve analytics to address insider threat analysis, improve continuous evaluation capabilities, and develop capabilities to meet additional Federal Agency requirements (e.g., Trusted Workforce 2.0). The system will continue to defend against cyber-attacks and improve defensibility by meeting new and evolving threats. Specifically, NBIS will continue to support Investigation Management (IM) Development for automation, new models, rules engines, and algorithms for optimization of assignments (i.e., continuous development); continue evolving the automation of IT infrastructure and DevSecOps tools and processes; implement Security Enterprise Architecture and Data Services to develop the capability to re-use data and analytics across multiple security missions, all while, simplifying system security and user access; supporting business transformation and late-derived requirements, technology change management, and Tier support for the NBIS Customers; identifying, developing, and testing multiple prototype efforts; and continuing to evolve and execute the adjusted implementation strategy based on lessons learned from prototype efforts and results of independent assessments."

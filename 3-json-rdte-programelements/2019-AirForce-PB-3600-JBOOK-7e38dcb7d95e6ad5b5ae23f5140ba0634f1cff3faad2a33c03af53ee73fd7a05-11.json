            "val": "Technology Transfer was titled Defense Technology Transfer and Defense Technology Link (TechLink) in previous Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) budgets.  The program was devolved from OSD in FY12 to achieve efficiencies in program management.  TechLink, DoD's first National level Partnership Intermediary (PI), was established by OSD in 1999 to provide direct Technology Transfer support to all Air Force, Army, Navy, and independent DoD Research Laboratories.  TechLink is a performance based, metrics-driven organization.\n\nTechLink brokers technology transfer agreements between Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories and US industry for the manufacture and use of DoD inventions.  These agreements enable DoD to leverage the investment and capabilities of the private-sector in development of new defense-related products and services, lowering DoD costs and also helping ensure that DoD-developed or co-developed technologies are transitioned to DoD operational use.  This program impacts virtually all technology fields, including medicine, software, electronics, communications, advanced materials, and energy-related technologies.\n\nIn FY 2019, Project 646030, AFWERX, was created under this program element to provide centralized funding for AFWERX activities.  AFWERX will link innovators to the Air Force's research and development activities, program offices, development planning & experimentation teams, and end users.  These linkages will create capability options and prototype opportunities for the Air Force. AFWERX was previously funded in FY 2017 and FY 2018 with execution year funding from various Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) RDT&E program elements.\n\nThis Program is Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Both of these activities enable DoD to leverage the investment and capabilities of the private-sector in development of new defense-related products and services, lowering DoD costs and also helping ensure that DoD-developed or co-developed technologies are transitioned to DoD operational use."

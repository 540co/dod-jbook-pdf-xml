Programs will explore new architectural concepts that employ a mix of weapon technologies that achieve lethality through a combination of overwhelming performance and overwhelming numbers rather than through the use of singular and costly high value assets.  Studies conducted under this program element include examination and evaluation of emerging aerospace threats, technologies, concepts, use of autonomy to minimize risk, and applications for missiles, munitions, and vehicle systems."

Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests.

Technologies will be explored to allow increased levels of autonomy, improved operating ranges, improved mobility through complex 3-dimensional battlespaces, and integration of the requirements for both ground and air mobility in complex urban warfare settings.  Reduced manning requirements will be a part of the design space evaluation, with unmanned vehicles operating in a supporting role instead of a traditional supported role.  Novel approaches to launch and recovery that reduce the need for highly trained personnel dedicated to monitoring unmanned vehicles will be explored.  Problems that cross all domains, such as high energy density power supplies, navigation through uncertain and changing environments, and supervisory autonomy of vehicles will be addressed.  Novel networking approaches will also be explored to close the seams between ground and air unmanned vehicles and to improve confidence in identifying risks associated with both natural hazards and enemy actions prior to ground personnel entering an area.

The program developed the technology for launch and recovery of large unmanned aircraft capable of providing persistent 24\/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  TERN enabled novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts enabled a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  DARPA transitioned the TERN program to the Office of Naval Research for continued development in Q4 FY 2018."

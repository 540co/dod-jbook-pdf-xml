The Department estimated the total effort outlined would require approximately $200M. In CY 2016 OSD(AT&L) allocated $100 million of Congressional funds to the Services to complete assessments of Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) mission area 1 and 2 Weapon Systems. The Department is on track to complete those assessments by CY 2018; with QDR 3-12 in progress and expected to be completed by CY 2019. Additional details are classified.

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) is a continuation of effort from the Trusted Foundry PE 0605140D8Z.  FY18 funds in the amount of $84.200M are being transferred from PE 0605140D8Z for the Verification and Validation (V&V) Capabilities and Standards for Trust and the New Trust Approach Development activities planned across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  \n\nThis PE implements, maintains and updates the DoD\u2019s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a Government-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the government.  Its goal is to eliminate the Department of Defense (DoD)\u2019s reliance on sole source foundries for trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics.  It supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD\u2019s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities that will implement three integrated, complementary solutions that (1) provide for Intellectual Property (IP) protection of microelectronics components; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate trust and assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentive the commercial marketplace to recognize trust as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to assuring the trust of the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial SOTA microelectronics technology.\n\nApproximately 30 percent of the DoD\u2019s Major Defense Acquisition Programs rely on the Trusted Foundry, the only Trust-accredited SOTA foundry, to build critical and sensitive integrated circuits for the DoD, Intelligence Community and Defense contractors.\n\nThis activity is being led by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)).  Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane is responsible for day-to-day management and execution of the DoD long-term trusted and assured microelectronics strategy.  This activity will include performers from the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) Steering Committee and a new Science and Technology (S&T) Advisory Board, and include performers, such as the JFAC service providers, Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), and other DoD and Intelligence Community S&T organizations and laboratories in the area of hardware assurance (HwA) and software assurance (SwA).  It will integrate and support the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and the related HwA and SwA S&T actions.  This activity is also expected to maintain and update the DoD long-term microelectronics strategy based on feedback from the execution of this PE and enable and leverage commercial and academic relationships as necessary to fulfill this mission."

Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories and other HwA and SwA capabilities are chartered as a JFAC to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and\/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technology nodes (<45 nanometers (nm)), throughput\/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities, in coordination with the JFAC, which prioritizes this investment as required to meet the realized and projected out-year demand for JFAC services.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:\n\n\u2022\tPhysical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards \n\u2022\tFunctional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening\/verification of select, critical parts\n\u2022\tDesign verification, i.e., verification\/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.\n\nThese improvements will address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.\n\nThis project develops and matures assurance mitigations, evaluates the effectiveness of protections of IP in support of integrity, and develops and validates obfuscation and disaggregation technologies.  The project will address physical validation tool and capability development, design software validation tool development, counterfeit detection and imaging techniques, and system vulnerability assessments and testbeds.\n\nThis project also develops standards and practices in support of trustworthy designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., trustworthy designs and supply chains.\n\nThis project was previously funded in PE 0605140D8Z BA 5 and has been transferred to this BA 4 PE to correctly align funding in support of the mission."

DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base IP from exploitation.  It also is intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of microelectronics trust and assurance.\n\nThis program of research will develop innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Trust techniques, active hardware trust control, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.   It also develops, demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.\n\nTechnologies that assure trust and assurance in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers and increase the Government\u2019s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of developed technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies developed under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of third-party IP to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.\n\nFunding for this project has been transferred from BA 5 PE 0605140D8Z."

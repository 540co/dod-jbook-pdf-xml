The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite\/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites\/infrastructure.  The savings are realized by coupling the JRSS and JMS. The JRSS collapses replicated IT security functionality for all Department of Defense (DoD) components into relatively few regionally located stacks.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information."

Each of the 23 NIPR and 25 SIPR stacks is comprised of complementary defensive security solutions that remove redundant Information Assurance (IA) protections; leverages enterprise defensive capabilities with standardized security suites; protects the enclaves after the separation of server and user assets; and provides the tool sets necessary to monitor and control all security mechanisms throughout DoD's Joint Information Environment.  The JRSS Management System (JMS) is the management and operational control suite\/capability for the JRSS. While the JMS is treated as a related effort, it requires its own experience and evaluation strategy as the JMS is a selection of best of breed capabilities. The JMS is a system-of-systems designed to centralize and enhance the management of the JRSS components and achieve economies of scale by using DoD common suites\/infrastructure.  The JMS provides Centralized Network Management of the JRSS with a standard interoperable set of capabilities across DoD.  JMS provides visibility and control over network transport and associated security systems.  It enables monitoring and analysis of relevant fault and performance data to determine the impact on current operations and trend analysis.  This centralized capability allows standardization of policies, procedures and configurations of critical network transport assets. The JMS enables DoD Components to maintain Title 10 required management and visibility of their IT security while providing high level visibility to CYBERCOM. Cyber Operations can take proactive actions to ensure the uninterrupted availability and protection of system and network information.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFY 2018 Actual: 100% successful testing of new pre-production capabilities for Full Packet Capture analytics (e.g. ArcSight and Splunk log); JMS 1.5 data orchestrator aggregation; and JRSS 1.5 active stack capabilities through the Joint Interoperability Test Command.

The intent of this strategy is to:  develop a system based upon a current understanding of joint requirements; rapidly field systems based upon those requirements; analyze operational utilization of the systems; and roll the results of the analysis into periodic upgrades of the systems to maintain currency and maximize operational effectiveness.  The baseline configuration is based upon existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) systems, scaled to the Combatant Command level.  The follow-on configurations will include newly developed capabilities based on emergent, joint requirements and operational feedback based upon utilization of earlier delivered systems."

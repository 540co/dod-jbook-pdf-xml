                            "val": "Contracting Information Technology System (CON-IT) provides a single contract writing system for the Air Force contracting community to support all contracting needs including base operations, logistics, contingency and weapons system contracting world-wide. CON-IT will enable strategic sourcing and other acquisition efficiencies by standardizing data, business rules, and milestone tracking. Furthermore, CON-IT will allow for a standardized and integrated method of anticipating, reacting, and responding to the current pace and changes in process, regulation, and technology across the contract domain. CON-IT is the replacement for Standard Procurement System (SPS). When fully implemented, CON-IT will enable business process changes necessary to converge on a common contract writing\/management capability within the Air Force.\n\nCON-IT capabilities will be developed in accordance with the agile software development methodology. The CON-IT Integrated Program Office (IPO) will configure upon the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA's) government off-the-shelf (GOTS) product called Integrated Defense Enterprise Acquisition System (IDEAS) contract writing system, which provided a 75% solution that serves as a baseline for CON-IT. CON-IT will utilize a non-traditional acquisition approach by leveraging DISA IDEAS as well as partnering with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Enterprise Application Services (EAS) team via an inter-agency agreement to develop, test, validate, train end users, deploy, and maintain CON-IT. USDA's National Information Technology Center (NITC) will provide and maintain the hosting environment.\n\nGap requirements will be addressed through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced and made available to operational users after every sprint. The IPO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.\n\nThrough agile software development CON-IT will address the current inefficiencies in the contracting domain, given there are multiple contract writing systems that continue to challenge the ability to operate responsively, consistently, and cost-effectively to award, administer, and close out mission critical contracts in a timely fashion. CON-IT will allow the contracting community to fully support compliance with financial auditability and Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) goals that depend on the integrity of the data flow through the Procure to Pay (P2P) process.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CON-IT weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F and 0605833F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

CON-IT system capabilities continue to be developed and enhanced through completion of development sprint cycles in accordance with our agile software development strategy. Furthermore, the CON-IT Integrated Program Office (IPO) has established early user engagement through a series of SME Familiarization (FAM) Events, in which system capabilities produced from each sprint cycle are tested by operational COs and valuable user feedback is collected and incorporated into our requirements backlog. Early Operational Capability (EOC) was achieved in Oct 17 with the deployment of current CON-IT capabilities to 12AF (AFSOUTH) users in which the users were successfully able to execute contracting actions and produce procurement instruments in support of SOUTHCOM\/AFSOUTH mission requirements. In addition, the CON-IT IPO has integrated the AETC Contracting Schoolhouses into our training activities; provided initial training to the instructors; ensured the schoolhouses develop and incorporate CON-IT into their training curriculum for new CO accessions. The successfulness of these events greatly aids in our risk reduction and organizational change management (OCM) efforts. Future system development continues to be planned through an iterative process of sprint\/release planning and backlog grooming activities between all our stakeholder partners which ensures that the capabilities developed meet our end users' needs and increase mission success."

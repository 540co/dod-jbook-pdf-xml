            "val": "Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) is a family of capabilities enabling Air Superiority for the Joint Force in the most challenging operational environments.  The program matures technology and reduces risk through prototyping activities and demonstration efforts.  Key NGAD attributes include enhancements in survivability, lethality, and persistence across a range of military operations.  The NGAD program is directed by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 043-13 and CSAF approved Air Superiority Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team (ECCT) Flight Plan.  Program activities will also include the pursuit of open architecture solutions including Open Mission Standards (OMS) and Universal Control Interface (UCI) standards management and preplanned product improvements. Funding provides program management support, operational concept exploration, technology studies, multi-domain integration assessments, operational and system architecture development, maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, including weapons systems and integrated system concept development and demonstration.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NGAD capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PE's: 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.  \n\nNGAD civilian pay is executed in PE 020711F.\n\nBetter Alignment of Resources: Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD)  \nDeferral of the development of specific Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) classified technologies results in a realignment of $357M in FY 2020, and $6,646M across the FYDP, to fund the development of the most promising classified technologies, which improve lethality by providing expanded capabilities.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The PE matures technology and reduces risk through prototyping activities and demonstration efforts.  Key NGAD attributes include enhancements in survivability, lethality, and persistence across a range of military operations.  The NGAD program is directed by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 043-13 and CSAF approved Air Superiority Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team (ECCT) Flight Plan.  Program activities will also include the pursuit of open architecture solutions including Open Mission Standards (OMS) and Universal Control Interface (UCI) standards management and preplanned product improvements. Funding provides program management support, operational concept exploration, technology studies, multi-domain integration assessments, operational and system architecture development, maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, including weapons systems and integrated system concept development and demonstration."

Furthermore, studies are required to develop operational\/system architectures to include family of systems and system of systems. In addition, technical risk reduction activities will be performed to include experimentation, integration and building demonstrative prototypes.\n\nThe 2030+ AD working groups methodically assessed candidate concepts using USAF directives and guidance. Resulting concepts informed the NGAD Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), which is in the final stages of coordination. Ongoing studies are conducted to refine system concepts and operational\/system architectures incorporating family of systems and system of systems that may be required to inform and support strategic choices. In addition, technical risk reduction studies concerning technology integration, operational and system trade space utilizing preliminary data from AD concept development have resulted in multiple activities and engagements to inform strategic USAF experimentation and prototyping efforts. Finally, technical overviews were presented to the Air Force - Scientific Advisory Board (AF-SAB) and other senior leaders."

The NGAD program is directed by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 043-13 and CSAF approved Air Superiority Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team (ECCT) Flight Plan.  Program activities will also include the pursuit of open architecture solutions including Open Mission Standards (OMS) and Universal Control Interface (UCI) standards management and preplanned product improvements. Funding provides program management support, operational concept exploration, technology studies, multi-domain integration assessments, operational and system architecture development, maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, including weapons systems and integrated system concept development and demonstration."

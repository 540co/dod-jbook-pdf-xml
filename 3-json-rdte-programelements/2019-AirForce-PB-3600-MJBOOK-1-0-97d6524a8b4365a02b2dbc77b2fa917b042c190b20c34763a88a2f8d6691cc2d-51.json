Funding supports establishment and use of virtual test capabilities for system of systems effectiveness testing\/evaluation for AEA, instantiating updated Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) scenarios into digital representations suitable for supporting modeling and simulation, conducting studies and technology risk mitigation demonstrations for potential AEA SoS components and AEA SoS battle management, development planning, planning for and conducting an OSD directed Joint AEA Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) (working group support and organic civilian salaries), and the development and maintenance of the Air Force electronic warfare capability investment strategy.  These efforts are crucial in the development of critical electronic attack capabilities in support of Air Force and joint operations to include Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).\n\nThe joint AEA SoS has evolved since 2004 and now includes the Navy EA-18G and its Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) subsystem and the Air Force EC-130H Compass Call Baseline 3 (significant upgrades to the former Block 35) configuration as modified escort\/stand-off components, respectively. As stand-in\/penetrating components, the AEA SoS includes the Air Force Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its jammer variant, MALD-J; Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft; and possible unmanned stand-in jamming\/counter electronics platforms and other stand-in and distributed components capable of suppressing or degrading enemy integrated air defense system (IADS) and non-IADS targets.  Current military actions continue to drive the need for increased focus on developing advanced electronic attack capabilities for use against both IADS and non-IADS targets such as radar sensors, infrared (IR) sensors, communications networks, remote controlled improvised explosive devices, computers, command and control links, man portable air defenses, etc. in both major combat and irregular warfare scenarios.\n\n\"This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AEA weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\"\n\nThis program is included in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it pursues materiel solutions passing Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at validating requirements."

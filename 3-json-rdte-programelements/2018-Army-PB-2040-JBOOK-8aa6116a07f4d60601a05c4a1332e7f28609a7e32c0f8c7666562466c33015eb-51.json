JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems\/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. \n\nJTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. JTAGS funding was moved to a new PE as directed by OSD to track Space Programs.\n\nThe JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 will be completed in FY17. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. P3I Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers stereo SBIRS Geosynchronous scanner capability and Pseudo-Link 4 (P\/L 4) data. Spiral 2 delivers Cobra Brass and \"Walkers\" data (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible."

P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, improving warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS  Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort.  JTAGS Block II Phase 2 is further divided into three spirals to provide critical capabilities to the fielded units faster.  JTAGS Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers stereo SBIRS Geosynchronous scanner capability and Pseudo-Link 4 (P\/L 4) data. Spiral 2 delivers Cobra Brass and \"Walkers\" data (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing to the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JTAGS Block II Phase 2 is a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) option on the JTAGS Block II (P3I) contract (W9113M-12-C-0055).  The option will be exercised based on a contractor updated proposal and Government technical evaluation.

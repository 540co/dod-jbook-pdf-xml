Program efforts mitigate critical capability gaps identified in the March 2011 Air Force Next Generation Tactical Air (TACAIR) Capabilities Based Assessment and revalidated in 2016 by the AS2030 ECCT. This program will provide air superiority capability improvements in the areas of persistence, survivability, lethality, connectivity, interoperability, and affordability. Funding provides program management support; operational concept exploration; technology studies, assessments and development; operational and system architecture development; maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, which includes weapons systems; and integrated system concept development and demonstration. \n\nBA-04 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Program efforts mitigate critical capability gaps identified in the March 2011 Air Force Next Generation Tactical Air (TACAIR) Capabilities Based Assessment and revalidated in 2016 by the AS2030 ECCT. This program will provide air superiority capability improvements in the areas of persistence, survivability, lethality, connectivity, interoperability, and affordability. Funding provides program management support; operational concept exploration; technology studies, assessments and development; operational and system architecture development; maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, which includes weapons systems; and integrated system concept development and demonstration. \n\nBA-04 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Program efforts mitigate critical capability gaps identified in the March 2011 Air Force Next Generation Tactical Air (TACAIR) Capabilities Based Assessment and revalidated in 2016 by the AS2030 ECCT. This program will provide air superiority capability improvements in the areas of persistence, survivability, lethality, connectivity, interoperability, and affordability. Funding provides program management support; operational concept exploration; technology studies, assessments and development; operational and system architecture development; maturation and risk reduction of air superiority related technologies, which includes weapons systems; and integrated system concept development and demonstration. \n\nBA-04 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

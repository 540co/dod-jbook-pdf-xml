Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, as well as the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department\u2019s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.\n\nIn FY 2019 CAPE received increased funding from the DoD Joint Service Provider to support the migration, implementation, and sustainment of its DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts. In addition to the one-year increased RDT&E funding in FY 2019 described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding throughout the FY 2019-2023 FYDP to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental solutions. CAPE's  funds are included in the total Internet DMZ Migration amount transferred from JSP to OSD so that CAPE and three other affected OSD Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) can execute their own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ."

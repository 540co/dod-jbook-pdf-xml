            "val": "The Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) strategy is to evolve current and future Protected MILSATCOM systems, sustain the existing AEHF system capability and develop a more affordable and resilient MILSATCOM enterprise capable of meeting near term and emerging MILSATCOM requirements. A significant thrust for this initiative is to demonstrate technologies and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) that lead to a future Protected Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM (PATS) capability that provides tactical-level MILSATCOM users protected, anti-jam satellite communications while operating in a contested environment.  PATS will provide tactical users significantly higher data rates than AEHF and a security architecture that enables forward deployed users to have protected satellite communications in scenarios where AEHF terminals cannot be deployed.  Under this construct the SMI will:  1) Reduce parts\/obsolescence risk to AEHF space vehicles, 2) Continue the AEHF Capabilities Insertion Program (CIP) to enhance the current AEHF constellation performance, and improve system operational resiliency, and 3) Invest in technologies and demonstrations (e.g. Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration) that enable the future Protected Tactical Enterprise Service and SATCOM programs by continued development of the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) technologies, maturing the Protected Tactical Testbed, and demonstrating resilient and affordable wideband protected technologies and CONOPS.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\"\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Advanced EHF MILSATCOM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

AEHF incorporated lessons learned and improvements from Milstar and commercial SATCOM practices into the next generation EHF secure, anti-jam military communications satellite system.  \n\nThe Protected SATCOM Key Management Architecture (PKMA) acquisition is a software development effort to update DoD secure satellite communication encryption systems and become compatible with the National Security Agency's enterprise Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed by USD(AT&L) on 17 June 2013. The prime contractor for the PKMA development under the NSA is Leidos with subcontracts to L3 Communications and General Dynamics.  The acquisition strategy is managed by NSA."

A significant thrust for this initiative is to demonstrate technologies and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) that lead to a future Protected Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM (PATS) capability that provides tactical-level MILSATCOM users protected, anti-jam satellite communications while operating in a contested environment.  PATS will provide tactical users significantly higher data rates than AEHF and a security architecture that enables forward deployed users to have protected satellite communications in scenarios where AEHF terminals cannot be deployed.  Under this construct the SMI will:  1) Reduce parts\/obsolescence risk to AEHF space vehicles, 2) Continue the AEHF Capabilities Insertion Program (CIP) to enhance the constellation performance and improve mission operational resiliency and 3) Invest in technologies and demonstrations (e.g. Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration or PTSFD) that enable the future Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) and SATCOM programs by continued development of the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) technologies, maturing the Protected Tactical Testbed, and demonstrating resilient and affordable wideband protected technologies and CONOPS."

The effort includes the design, development, factory testing and fabrication of PTW-enabled TM LRU prototypes for integration, compatibility testing and Type-1 cryptographic certification evaluation by the NSA to support potential future acquisitions by the service Terminal Program Offices (TPOs).  The acquisition strategy includes the award of up to three TM LRU contracts; each a four-year, Cost-Plus Incentive Fee, Cost-Plus Fixed Fee with a Firm Fixed Price option contract, awarded through a full and open competitive, best-value source selection process.  The PTSFD will use a Government-built ground test bed to facilitate the demonstrations and to allow for compatibility and integration testing for the TM LRU."

Each MTC includes multiple high fidelity Simulator Cockpits, Instructor Operator Stations, a Threat Server and Brief\/Debrief and Mission Observation capability. Each is capable of linking to geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Full Combat Mission Training capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nIn FY 2019, PE 0207701F, Full Combat Mission Training, Project 655354, F-16 Blk 40\/50 MTC efforts were transferred to PE 0207133F, F-16, Project 672671, F-16 Blk 40\/50 MTC, in order to transfer programmatic responsibilities and funding to the F-16 weapon system team.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

DMO is an operational readiness initiative enabling the USAF to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war while facilitating unit-level training. FCMT funding provides research in areas benefiting the AF DMO\/LVC environment as a whole.  Provides research and development to facilitate integration of fielded and newly acquired, Air Force owned training devices into DMO\/LVC networks.  Enhances the quality of training for the systems added to the network.  Enables aircrews to network with LVC components to form the integrated DMO battlespace.  Links geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  Develops, demonstrates and inserts multi-level security capability.  This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training."

The initial systems in the DMO\/LVC environment; F-15C, AWACS, F-16 Block 40\/50 and F-15E, all required new training systems.  In addition, the Operations and Integration capability was created.  The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies.  Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO\/LVC capability will be modified using Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO-LVC environment.  To accomplish this, AFRL will conduct research\/studies to Develop\/implement Cross Domain Solutions, develop DMO capabilities, Validate warfighter seasoning and develop objective performance enhancements and conduct other network studies."

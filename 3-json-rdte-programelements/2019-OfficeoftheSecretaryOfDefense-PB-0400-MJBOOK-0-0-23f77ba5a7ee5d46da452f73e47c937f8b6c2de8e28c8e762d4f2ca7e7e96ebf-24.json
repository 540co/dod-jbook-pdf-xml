            "val": "The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  JWP supports partnership for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Component programs that equip forces for joint missions. The account underwrites analyses and studies,  limited-scope experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.   JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions. This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and affordable joint solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.   JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD, the Joint Staff and joint command counterparts, the AT&L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on joint warfighting environments in the future.   \n\nTypical projects funded with JWP include independent analysis and translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources support  analytic expertise on joint issues.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also supportthe development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts. \nThe  JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  In many cases, JWP funds initiatives for process improvements serving all Components, but aligned with no single Service or Agency.  These early assessments and studies of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  JWP often represents the first effort to define integrated and innovative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities through cross-cutting analysis and studies in partnership with  the OSD staffs serving AT&L, Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.  It evolves analytic development of Joint Military Requirements addressing evolving threats \/ missions On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS."

It supports joint capability development serving the needs of joint warfighters in partnership with senior acquisition staffs.  It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps and can establish a framework for subsequent field experiments, capability demonstrations or accelerated acquisition.  Joint warfare independent analysis often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.    On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS."

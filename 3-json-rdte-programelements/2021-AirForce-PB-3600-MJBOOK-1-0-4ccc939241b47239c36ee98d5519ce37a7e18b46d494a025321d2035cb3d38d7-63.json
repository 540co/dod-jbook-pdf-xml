            "val": "Replacement of the legacy tanker fleet will take place in several stages.  The initial tanker replacement increment of KC-46s will replace roughly a third of the current capability.  Future programs will ultimately recapitalize the entire tanker fleet over a period of more than 30 years.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The program is procuring four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability which will ultimately be operationally fielded.  During production, the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots.  The KC-46 program held a MS C DAB on 12 Aug 2016 and received approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  The program awarded LRIP Lots 1 and 2 on 18 Aug 2016, LRIP Lot 3 on 27 Jan 2017, LRIP Lot 4 on 10 Sep 2018, and LRIP Lot 5 on 27 Sep 2019. Lot 6 award is planned for May 2020 totaling 79 aircraft to date. The Air Force delivered the first KC-46 to McConnell Air Force Base on 25 Jan 2019. As of 10 Jan 2020, 30 aircraft have been delivered to the Air Force. KC-46 funding also supports Training Systems, Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, government developmental and operational test support, mission planning capability development, various studies and analyses, KC-46 requirements definition and demonstrations in support of Air Force Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) initiative, engineering changes, and future tanker replacement planning activities.\n\nThe KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for worldwide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battlespace awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe Aircrew Training System (ATS) and the Maintenance Training System (MTS) are being developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The ATS contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation.  The ATS contract will provide Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), to include Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), Boom Operator Trainers (BOTs), Fuselage Trainers (FuTs), and Part-Task Trainers (PTTs) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The ATS contract will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire a technical data package to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  \n\nThe MTS contract was awarded 6 Jul 2016 to The Boeing Company.  The MTS acquisition focuses on designing, developing, testing, producing, and fielding an optimized training system for KC-46 maintainers by integrating various forms of training media and Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) into a \"blended\" solution.  This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, \"high-fidelity\" Augmented Hardware Training Devices (AHTDs), PTTs, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), and emerging technologies to meet validated Air Mobility Command (AMC) maintenance training requirements.\n\nIn FY2021, PE 0605221F KC-46, Project 655271 KC-46 RDT&E, and Project 651120 Pegasus Capability Improvements efforts were transferred to PE 401221F, Project 655271 KC-46 RDT&E, and Project 651120 Pegasus Capability Improvements in order to consolidate all KC-46 activity under a single PE. PE 0401221F also has historical Tanker Replacement costs from FY 2005-2008.\n\nThis requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-46 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

The KC-46 will operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for worldwide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battlespace awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe dynamics and mission urgency of the post-production (post-DD-250) environment requires the program to maintain a flexible and responsive posture to support a broad range of mission support needs.  The KC-46 will continue to identify, design, develop, integrate, verify, certify, produce, install, field, and sustain a comprehensive range of non-recurring and recurring post-production, air vehicle enhancements and field support needs.  These needs may originate from programmed Mobility Air Force (MAF) requirements, Combatant Commander Joint or Urgent Operational Needs (JUON\/UON), non-programmed Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) directives, requirements identified and supported by Higher Headquarters (HHQ) Enterprise Capability Collaboration Teams (i.e., High Value Airborne Asset [HVAA], Air Superiority 2030, and Multi-Domain Command and Control [MDC2]), or correction of field deficiencies.\n\nThe KC-46 will continue to develop, field, and sustain warfighter capabilities to meet evolving threats and mission support requirements through Block or discrete modification or modernization programs depending on mission urgency, available funding, and programmatic and technical risks.  Post-production requirements can include, but will not be limited to: avionics and structural systems\/ architecture and subsystem updates, general mission equipment updates and procurement, general sustainment support, studies and analyses, future Tanker requirements simulation and training, and correction of field deficiencies.\n \nBPAC 651120 funding will also support Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, test support, mission planning capability development and various studies and analyses.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-46 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

KC-46 PPCM oversight will promote competition throughout the life cycle of the KC-46A fleet.  All KC-46 post-production requirements and associated acquisition strategies will be carefully managed, reviewed, and approved at the appropriate levels by the KC-46 Division and\/or Tanker Directorate senior functional leaders.  PPCM requirements will employ multiple contract-types, tailored to the requirement and documented in discrete Acquisition Strategy Panel briefings, to minimize cost, technical, and schedule execution risks and ensure on-time deliverables.  In addition, all ACAT-level programs, deriving from the PPCM process, will follow Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5000.01 and DoD Instruction 5000.02 guidelines and directives, as applicable, to ensure management controls--commensurate with the scope and cost of the supported requirement."

                            "val": "Replacement of the legacy tanker fleet will take place in several stages.  The initial tanker replacement increment of KC-46s will replace roughly a third of the current capability.  Future programs will ultimately recapitalize the entire tanker fleet over a period of more than 30 years.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The program is procuring four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability which will ultimately be operationally fielded.  During production, the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots.  The KC-46 program held a MS C DAB on 12 Aug 2016 and received approval to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  The program awarded LRIP Lots 1 and 2 on 18 Aug 2016, LRIP Lot 3 on 27 Jan 2017, LRIP Lot 4 on 10 Sep 2018, and LRIP Lot 5 on 27 Sep 2019. Lot 6 award is planned for May 2020, and will bring the total number of aircraft on contract to 79. The Air Force delivered the first KC-46 to McConnell Air Force Base on 25 Jan 2019. As of 10 Jan 2020, 30 aircraft have been delivered to the Air Force.   KC-46 funding also supports Training Systems, Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, government developmental and operational test support, mission planning capability development, various studies and analyses, engineering changes, and future tanker replacement planning activities.\n\nThe KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for worldwide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battlespace awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe Aircrew Training System (ATS) and the Maintenance Training System (MTS) are being developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The ATS contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation.  The ATS contract will provide Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), to include Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), Boom Operator Trainers (BOTs), Fuselage Trainers (FuTs), and Part-Task Trainers (PTTs) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The ATS contract will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire a technical data package to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  \n\nThe MTS contract was awarded 6 Jul 2016 to The Boeing Company.  The MTS acquisition focuses on designing, developing, testing, producing, and fielding an optimized training system for KC-46 maintainers by integrating various forms of training media and Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) into a \"blended\" solution.  This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, \"high-fidelity\" Augmented Hardware Training Devices (AHTDs), PTTs, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), and emerging technologies to meet validated Air Mobility Command (AMC) maintenance training requirements.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-46 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

The KC-46 contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, and resulted in a FY 2011 EMD Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract. The EMD phase will develop, build, and test four KC-46 aircraft, and will qualify the KC-46 as a tanker and certify pairings with receiver aircraft.\n\nThe MS B acquisition strategy planned for two LRIP lots followed by 11 Full Rate Production (FRP) lots for a total aircraft procurement of 175 production aircraft. Updates to the acquisition strategy occurred in support of Milestone C (MS C) that increased LRIP from two to five lots and the remaining eight to be FRP lots with the total aircraft buy remaining at 175 Production aircraft (+4 EMD aircraft for a grand total of 179 aircraft).\n\nLRIP consists of two Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and three FFP Not to Exceed (NTE) options (LRIP-1 Qty 7, LRIP-2 Qty 12, LRIP-3 Qty 15, LRIP-4 Qty 18, and LRIP-5 Qty 15). This will be followed by eight (Lots 6-13) FFP production options [via NTE values + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)]. LRIP Lots 1 and 2 were awarded on 18 Aug 2016, LRIP Lot 3 was awarded on 27 Jan 2017, LRIP Lot 4 was awarded on 10 Sep 2018, and LRIP Lot 5 was awarded on 27 Sep 2019. \n\nThe ATS acquisition strategy is to provide ATDs, and associated support structure, to each MOB and the FTU. The ATS EMD FPIF contract with production options was conducted via a full and open competition per FAR Part 15, and awarded to FlightSafety Services Corporation in FY 2013.  The ATS EMD phase will develop and procure ATDs; and will be supported with courseware, Training System Support Center, the technical data package, and support equipment to ensure system availability and concurrency with the aircraft. The first four ATS production options were exercised on 19 Aug 2015, 31 May 2017, 30 Apr 2018, and 31 Mar 2019. \n\nThe MTS acquisition strategy is to acquire MTDs, and associated support structure, for two AMC active duty Regional Maintenance Training Facilities.  The MTS EMD FFP contract with production options was conducted via a full and open competition per FAR Part 15, and awarded to The Boeing Company in FY 2016.  The MTS EMD phase will develop and procure MTDs; and will be supported with courseware, Training System Support Center, the technical data package, and support equipment to ensure system availability and concurrency with the aircraft.\n\nThe KC-46 Program is responsible for the development, testing, and production of a drogue-equipped, wing-mounted refueling system to meet Capability Production Document (CPD) thresholds and objectives for simultaneous refueling of two probe-equipped receivers. The system can be installed or removed from the KC-46 as mission needs dictate.\n\nThe long-term support concept for the KC-46 is organic two-level maintenance (2LM): organization level (O-level) and depot level (D-level). For the purposes of this program, all maintenance other than O-level shall be referred to as D-level. The product support strategy will initially employ Interim Contractor Support (ICS) before transitioning to a 100% organically-managed maintenance and supply support capability. Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solutions will be evaluated during EMD as viable approaches to facilitate the transition."

The total cost represents the current Program Office Estimate (POE) which accounts for the ceiling price of the contract plus the financial and schedule risk of potential design changes for the KC-46 aircraft.\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: The KC-46 is evaluated against traditional Research and Development (R&D) program expenditure benchmarks.  Unlike many traditional R&D programs, the KC-46 EMD contract is a FPIF contract with progress payments.  Twenty percent of incurred costs are withheld until the end of the contract, when they are liquidated.  Mandatory funding obligations and progress payment withholds will cause the program to lag traditional expenditure benchmarks, painting an inaccurate portrait of overall program health."

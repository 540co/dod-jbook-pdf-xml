            "val": "The Space Development Agency (SDA) is established to develop the next generation space architecture to enable U.S. military operations to be responsive to emerging multi-domain threats against our national security.  To achieve that goal, the SDA will help inform the Department's decision to develop and implement a proliferated architecture enabled by lower-cost, mass-produced spacecraft and routine space access, shift the Department to a development organization focused on experimentation, prototyping, and accelerated fielding, and change the Department to a concentrated, decoupled structure to generate speed.  The SDA will manage, direct, and execute the development of the space capabilities in accordance with DoD\u2019s Space Vision and field space capabilities at speed and scale, with the following goals: \n\n\u2022\tbold breakthroughs designed to out-pace our competitors,\n\u2022\ttechnology maturation and systems engineering,\n\u2022\tlean engineering, manufacturing, and support,\n\u2022\tindustrial base expansion; streamlined development and acquisition process, and\n\u2022\tincreased acquisition cooperation with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).\n\nThe SDA will rapidly deploy critical elements of the next-generation space capabilities, initially focusing on these essential capabilities: \n\n\u2022\tPersistent global surveillance for advanced missile targeting,\n\u2022\tIndications, warnings, targeting, and tracking for defense against advanced missile threats,\n\u2022\tAlternate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) for a GPS-denied environment,\n\u2022\tGlobal and near-real time space situational awareness,\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a deterrent capability\n\u2022\tResponsive, resilient, common ground-based space support infrastructure (e.g., ground stations and launch capability),\n\u2022\tCross-domain, networked, node-independent battle management command, control, and communications (BMC3), and \n\u2022\tHighly-scaled, low-latency, persistent, artificial intelligence-enable global surveillance. \n\nThe establishment of a data transport layer in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is essential to developing a new, responsive space architecture, and will be SDA\u2019s primary initial focus.  The SDA will develop an initial wedge of sub-constellations on this transport layer to provide additional capabilities, such as advanced missile warning.\n\nThis program element funds efforts to develop and demonstrate a prototype proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) communications and data transport layer and its sub-constellations in support of the DoD Space Vision."

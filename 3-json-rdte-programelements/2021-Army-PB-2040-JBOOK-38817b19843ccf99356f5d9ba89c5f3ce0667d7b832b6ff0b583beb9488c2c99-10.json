However, technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it. This Program Element (PE) includes Projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques. It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities. The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential. EQT demonstration\/validation is systemic and applicable across Department of Army sites and installation problems (e.g. unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination). This PE supports the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment. All work is endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment to determine when the technology can transition to the user for implementation."

The NDCEE is used to: demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process. The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation. This Project is managed by the Army on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment.  In May 2008, the Project name was re-designated from the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters. This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, \"Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management.\"\n\nThe United States (U.S.) Army's broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others. Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at Army installations. The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives in consideration of mission, readiness, innovation, lethality and modernization."

The management strategy for the NDCEE ensures that all projects have a potential multi-service benefit and have a high potential for transition success. At the strategic level, the NDCEE Executive Advisory Board (EAB) is chaired by the DoD NDCEE Lead Agent on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment and is representative of the services and DoD. The EAB and the Program Director are supported by the NDCEE Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to help ensure that NDCEE investments are maximized across DoD and the Services. At the tactical level, the three Focus Groups (environment, safety\/occupational health, and energy) cultivate and recommend priority projects to the TAG and Project Selection Committee for funding. Transition Partners ensure that NDCEE's investments are carried forward in the next phases of the Research Development Test and Evaluation process, as identified in each funded project's Technology Transition Agreement.\n\nNDCEE projects enable readiness for the Services under increasingly complex and demanding scenarios. The interdependency of national security with energy supply and costs, water supply and costs, environmental resiliency, and human health and safety are clear and NDCEE projects provide forward-looking solutions to these challenges. Failure to further fund and validate promising technologies that are at the mature or Commercial-off-the-Shelf stage, would result in lost modernization opportunities and validation before they go into a military environment. These initiatives need to be carried forward into an operational\/realistic testing environment so that they can support mission readiness and training when ultimately fielded to the Services."

The Project showcases technologies that increase life safety, reduce Soldier and worker human health risks, enhance readiness and enable mission capabilities of the current and future force with a focus on eliminating the high priority issues associated with hexavalent chromium, cadmium and airborne lead through material substitution. The Project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating modern materials and processes to fulfill or surpass the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data. Forward-looking materials and processes demonstrated under this project support the Cross Functional Teams and the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment. Modernized materials and processes have the additional benefit of reducing future regulatory compliance and cleanup requirements while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army, resulting in significantly reduced life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users."

            "val": "This program consolidates Air Force funding and management of common Electronic Warfare (EW) systems from Materiel Solutions Analysis through Engineering and Manufacturing Development and transition to operational capability.  EW is an integral warfighting effect supporting AF Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack and Global Mobility operations as well as Joint-Coalition operations.  EW systems influence, deceive, disrupt, degrade, deny, and destroy threats to air operations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. This program supports Electronic Support (ES), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic Attack (EA).  ES programs support the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information related to the detection, geo-location, characterization, and identification of threats to air operations.  EP Programs preserve the electromagnetic spectrum for use by friendly forces.  EA programs provide self-protection through active and passive measures that deceive threats to air operations using kinetic and non-kinetic means to defeat threats that rely on the electromagnetic spectrum (Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR)).  \n\nThe Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and Jammer (MALD-J) configurations are key enablers supporting Air Force Global Strike, Global Response, Space and C4ISR, and Air and Space Expeditionary Force Concepts of Operation. MALD is a low cost, powered, expendable decoy designed to represent the kinematics and radar signature characteristics of various combat aircraft. The MALD will be employed from various aircraft platforms to stimulate, saturate, and deceive integrated air defense systems (IADS) thus increasing the survivability of strike aircraft. FY 18 and FY 19 funding will be used to fund critical program development activities to include M Code.  This effort will develop and integrate advanced precision, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities (e.g. GPS, non-GPS, optical, passive, active, etc.) on MALD-J.\n\nBA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

These missiles may employ sophisticated next-generation Electro-Optics (EO), Infrared (IR), Radio Frequency (RF), dual-mode (i.e. IR and RF), or multi-mode seekers.  AIRCM will provide advanced expendable countermeasures and\/or techniques that will be functionally compatible with existing dispenser systems and employed across multiple USAF weapons systems.  This also explicitly includes any and all flare, chaff, decoy, and associated components development and testing that may be demanded or needed in current operations supporting the war on terrorism regardless of aircraft platform.  Similar activities that are supplementary to this effort may be accomplished ad hoc using platform specific funding or through other activities such as joint services or NATO test groups.\n\nBA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

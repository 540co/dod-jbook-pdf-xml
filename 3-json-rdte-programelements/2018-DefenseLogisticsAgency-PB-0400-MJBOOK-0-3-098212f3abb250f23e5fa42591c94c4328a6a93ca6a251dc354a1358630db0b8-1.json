            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters\u2019 needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  \n\nBeginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  \n\u2022\tThe Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  \n\u2022\tMaintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. \n\u2022\tThe Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.    \n\nOver the FY 18- FY 22 Planning Period, funds were realigned within the ManTech PE, from the DLA Log R&D PE (0603712S) and DLA Procurement Defense-Wide Fund.  These funds will address critical shortfalls in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes and Maintaining Viable Supply Sources.  The largest requirement was in the Maintaining Viable Supply Sources to develop a long-term, reliable source of linear microcircuits.  These devices are critical to maintaining the readiness of front line weapon system electronics.  High priority requirements in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA included additional funding for battery technology, castings and forging manufacturing technology."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings\/Forging Programs and Additive Manufacturing programs.  \n\nThe Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. BATTNET conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries.  BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nDLA is also conducting some short-term (FY17-FY18) manufacturing improvements in the Vacuum Electron Tube supply chain within this Budget Project. Electron tubes are still an essential product in Defense and National Security radar systems. included will be value-added studies and tests of alternative materials for tungsten wire and microwave quality glass to address obsolescence in these material supply chains.\n\nThe Subsistence Network (SUBNET) Program is a Manufacturing Technology Program and is the successor to the CORANET R&D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program's expanded areas of interest includes: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security. SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. Desired outcomes include measures such as reduced cost, increased efficiencies, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.\n\nThe Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.

These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler."

DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.\n\nThe DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   \n\nThe Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.\n\nThe Emerging Manufacturing Technology program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems."

Begin a schedule for implementations to be initiated in FY19.\n\nDLIR program will continue moving DLA from PDF Tech Data to Smart Data and Engineering Models and leveraging semantic technology to improve logistics data across the DLA Enterprise.\n\nEmerging Manufacturing Technologies addresses the opportunities to start new manufacturing technology developments that occur out of the budget cycle. It is a new start in FY18.  Having an Emerging Technologies line allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs. In other programs DLA R&D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off project start-up lead-times. Saving the startup lead-time allows the Agency to get advanced technology into the hands of the warfighter earlier that would otherwise be the case and begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case. It also allows ongoing programs to maintain continuity of funding and activity. SBIR phase III efforts (which can't be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging battery technologies, and technologies to address strategic materials shortage\/risk."

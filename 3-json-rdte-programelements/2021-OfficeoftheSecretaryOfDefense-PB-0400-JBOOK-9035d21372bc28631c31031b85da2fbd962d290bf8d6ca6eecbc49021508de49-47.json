It addresses the challenges of 1) having enduring access to a multiplicity of modern manufacturing processes that require commercial volumes to maintain long term viability and 2) protecting the intellectual property (IP) of the microelectronic parts that are manufactured.\n\nThis PE supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy\u2019s (NDS) line of effort to build a more lethal force through modernization of key capabilities, the NDS defense objective of establishing an unmatched twenty-first century National Security Innovation Base that effectively supports Department operations and sustains security and solvency, and the NDS strategic approach of reforming the Department\u2019s business practices by simultaneously increasing performance and affordability while still minimizing risk.\n\nThis PE supports the OUSD(R&E) Microelectronics Modernization Roadmap.  The primary areas of focus of this roadmap include the following:  access to advanced packaging and test; quantifiable assurance and secure design; foundry access; verification and validation; policies, standards, and Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) governing body; access to radiation hardened microelectronics; access to non-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics; disruptive research and development; education and workforce development; trusted foundry and obsolescence; and supply chain awareness and security.\n\nRecognizing that an assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG. \n\nThis activity is being led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering."

Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and\/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technology nodes (<32 nanometers (nm)), throughput\/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party intellectual property (IP) contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities as required to meet the realized and projected out-year demand for core Trusted & Assured Microelectronics laboratory services.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:\n\n\u2022 Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. \n\u2022 Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening\/verification of select, critical parts.\n\u2022 Design verification, i.e., verification\/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.\n\nThese improvements address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments and quantify assurance.\n\nThis project develops and matures assurance mitigations, quantitatively evaluates the effectiveness of protections of IP in support of confidentiality and integrity, and develops and validates obfuscation and disaggregation technologies.  The project will address physical validation tool and capability development, design software validation tool development, counterfeit detection and imaging techniques, system vulnerability assessments, testbeds, and distributed data source availability to demonstrate and operationalize full lifecycle data driven quantifiable assurance.\n\nThis project also develops standards and practices in support of assured designs, supply chains and formal relationships with industry."

DoD\u2019s ability to access commercial technology for its custom, secure, and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD\u2019s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base intellectual property (IP) from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of core Trusted & Assured Microelectronics laboratories with regard to verification and validation of SOTA microelectronics assurance.\n\nThis program of research will develop, demonstrate, and implement quantitative and innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD\u2019s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted and assured strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop, demonstrate, and implement advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing, provenance and traceability, and independent verification and validation of commercial and specialized DoD designs.  It will also develop, demonstrate, and implement concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.\n\nAssurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risk associated with sole-source suppliers and increase the Government\u2019s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of developed technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases in which the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies developed under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in secure environments.  The project would also support using a repository of vetted third-party IP and electronic data automation (EDA) tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.\n\nThis project initially received additional funding in FY 2019 to support Microelectronics Innovation for National Security and Economic Competitiveness (MINSEC) efforts in the following focus areas:  capture and secure microelectronics R&D; new microelectronics development; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronics.  In FY 2019, funding for those MINSEC activities was reallocated from projects P-646 to P-647."

It will strengthen security while improving access, exposing no sensitive intellectual property (IP) to the foundry and requiring post-manufacture validation of foundry products. The enhancement will develop quantifiably assured design concepts in manufactured systems, enabling a formal risk-based approach to protection techniques. Manufactured microelectronics will be tested to ensure that IP protections meet or exceed current National Security Agency standards for IP protection, and to develop DoD\u2019s ability to detect certain malicious supply chain attacks on DoD microelectronics. \n\nSuccessful implementation will transition these technologies to use in DoD programs, obtain access to multiple commercial microelectronics facilities, establish secure design capabilities, and solidify a data-driven approach to supply chain protection.  It also includes keeping pace with the rapid advancements in microelectronics technology and the globalization of this industry sector. It will provide the basics for updating and strengthening DoD assurance policy and includes collaborating with industry to develop data driven quantifiable standards."

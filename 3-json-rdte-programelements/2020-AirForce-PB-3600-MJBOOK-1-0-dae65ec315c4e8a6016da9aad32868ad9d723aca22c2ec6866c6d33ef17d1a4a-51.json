PCL delivers vital one-of-a-kind research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) expertise directly to the warfighter, capability developer, and allied\/coalition forces.\n\nFrom its inception in 1985, PCL constantly advances the state-of-the-art for developmental smart munitions, seekers\/sensors, and their platforms.  PCL also focuses its capability against today's networked weapons, emerging weapon concepts, and helps develop innovative targeting technologies to be employed against a wide variety of vehicle targets, theater air defense units, and an extensive array of associated equipment.  \n\nCombat systems and support equipment exhibit physical characteristics (i.e. signatures) and present certain vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by various targeting technologies leading to the elimination or incapacitation of the threat through the application of force (e.g. smart munitions or directed energy) or application of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) methods.  PCL collects physical, functional, and signature attributes of real foreign threat systems and related equipment; these data feed high-fidelity models used to predict detection, classification, vulnerability, and effectiveness performance for ISR sensor and weapon system design.  PCL collects high resolution signature data using a variety of ground, air, and space-based sensors against both new and existing (obtained, sustained, and maintained to be signature representative) foreign targets; with and without the presence of camouflage, concealment, and deception materials; and operated using enemy tactics\/CONOPS.  The resulting highly reliable, realistic data directly support munitions\/targeting development programs and helps mitigate overall acquisition risk. PCL serves as a major focal point for joint signature exploitation, collection, and dissemination within the DoD. PCL is a prime contributor in the time critical process to rapidly exploit, assess, and determine US and allied weapon\/targeting performance against high value targets. Customers include: the major Defense and Service Intelligence Centers, all Services, the Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) who develop the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs), Combatant Commands, AF Major Commands, US Air Force Weapons School curriculum support, and others. Current projects include, but are not limited to: target signature exploitation, target geometric modeling (for identifying vulnerabilities), improving air capabilities against protected structures (specifically hard and deeply buried targets), and the testing of multiple seekers, sensors, and targeting technologies in representative environments against COCOM\/MAJCOM\/IC high value targets.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Chicken Little capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

Weather System Follow-on (WSF) is a component of SBEM efforts to develop capabilities to satisfy weather Gap 3 Ocean Surface Vector Winds (OSVW), Gap 8 Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI), and Gap 11 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Energetic Charged Particles (LEO ECP). Gap 3 OSVW and Gap 8 TCI require a space-based microwave sensor to provide polarimetric ocean surface wind direction and speed required for naval sea operations, as well as fighter sortie generations and marine amphibious operations. Gap 11 LEO ECP requires in situ ECP sensor for space situational awareness. The earliest possible launch options are being integrated in the design for critical gaps.\n\nDoD established WSF as a Pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) with the Space Force as the lead component. Based on the SBEM AoA results, the WSF initial thrusts will be to enable:\n\n1) DoD use of data collected by civil, international and other DoD space systems;\n2) Timely weather collection over broad oceans in support of maneuvering forces;\n3) Space weather capabilities to characterize operational orbits, space situational awareness, and the ionosphere.\n\nSecondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the SBEM AoA and validated by the JROC.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WSF weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

WSF-M SV-2 ILC is currently projected for FY 2028.  The WSF SV-2 will be functionally equivalent to SV-1.  Naval Research Lab Blossom Point Tracking Facility (BPTF) will be used as a viable unclassified EGS-compatible SOC for WSF-M. BPTF consists of a satellite mission operations center, multiple ground antennas including via SFSCN, and an existing infrastructure capable of providing space system command, control, and communications (C3). \n            \nThe WSF ECP sensor development will leverage current AFRL sensor and hazard assessment technology to accelerate availability of ECP sensor for integration on WSF-M and other planned SF satellite acquisitions.

In compliance with Executive Order #13589 OAD's major focus is achieving greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation through operations research methodologies such as: statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations. Division analysts are credited with innovations in analysis of amphibious operations and Irregular Warfare (IW) that have expanded state-of-the-art operations research methods across DOD. OAD quantifies resource allocation decisions pertaining to weapon systems, strategic personnel, training management, and equipment acquisition.OAD provides day-to-day oversight of Marine Corps M&S policy, standards,enterprise architecture, S&T requirements, and workforce development\n\nEfforts are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan, Marine Corps Operating Concepts (MOC) which provides the foundation and context for subordinate operating and functional concepts; guides analysis; wargaming scenarios and experimentation; wargaming capability development designed to examine, scope  and evaluate conceptual technological and operational principles and methods; informs capability development and budget programming decisions; CD&I Force Development Strategic Plan which provides Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC)\/Combat Development and Integration (CD&I) personnel framework designed to promote  collaborative, cohesive, \"learning organization\" that can effectively prepare the Nation's expeditionary force in readiness for a complex and uncertain future envisioned by the Department of Defense, the Department of the Navy, and the Commandant,and FRAGO 2017 to support the USMC to adapt, innovate, and change to meet future threats. \n\nFuture studies support Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF's) and Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU's) with research analysis and modeling and simulation focused on aviation, amphibious, warfighting, and ground operations enhancing the ability of the Marine Corps to increase operational, logistical and equipment efficiencies and capabilities and provide a unique, well trained, equipped and educated force.  \n\nThis program element has been revised into two specialized analytical divisions: (1) External Analysis Division (EAD) - responsible for providing joint external analysis is the Marine Corps' sole representative in the joint modeling arenas.  Provides deployed on site professional operations analysis support to Special Purpose MAGTFs in CENTCOM and AFRICOM.  (2) Combat Development Analysis Division responsible for executing a select portfolio of studies for senior leadership, Capabilities Based Assessment (CAB) and Marine Corps Enterprise Integration Plan (MCEIP)."

MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n\nMarine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers.

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research & Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items."

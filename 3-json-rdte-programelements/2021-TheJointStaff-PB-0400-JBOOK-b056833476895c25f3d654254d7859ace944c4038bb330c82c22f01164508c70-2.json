As part of the Joint Staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to IAMD issues. JIAMDO is the IAMD proponent for requirements and capabilities within the DoD\u2019s resource allocation system. JIAMDO leads IAMD mission and utility analysis, integrates IAMD within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations of joint IAMD architectures. \n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the United States. JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs. At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM development of IAMD prioritized capabilities list and the global integrated IAMD assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and homeland defense solutions."

Program efforts support transition of promising Science and Technology candidate medical technologies (drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and mechanisms for detection and control of disease carrying insects) to larger scale testing in humans for safety and effectiveness. Programs are aligned to meet future force requirements identified within concept documents and organizational structures. This PE also provides funding for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated human clinical trials to gain additional information about safety and effectiveness on the path to licensure for use in humans. These efforts are managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command."

These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug\/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug\/vaccine works and continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices. This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and accelerated recovery time once diagnosed to enhance battlefield readiness. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members. Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production). Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A\/Project 849."

Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs affecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. The cumulative cost of treating HIV-positive DoD personnel is estimated to be $16.6 billion for 3000 personnel over a 50-year lifetime. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA regulations.

The MEDEVAC MEP program modernizes and retrofits MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by a limited number of mission specific MEDEVAC helicopters, model HH-60M. The Medevac Mission Equipment on the Army MEDEVAC helicopters is critical to maintaining high US troop survival rates during current and future conflicts by evacuating wounded troops quickly while providing good care enroute.  To better meet operational needs, in 2009 the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (VCSA) approved the force design update increasing the number of air frames for MEDEVAC companies. In 2010, the Army Medical Department (US Army) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  Ongoing research and design efforts are required to prepare and optimize the MEDEVAC fleet with mission equipment. All products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A\/Project VS8."

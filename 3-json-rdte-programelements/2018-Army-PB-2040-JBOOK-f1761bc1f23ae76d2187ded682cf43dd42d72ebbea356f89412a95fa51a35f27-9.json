            "val": "This program element aligns system development and demonstration of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (HTV) with Future Force requirements to support combat and combat support missions. Missions include the following: line haul, local haul, and unit resupply. HTV trucks transport water, ammunition, and general cargo over all terrain and throughout the battle-space. Funding will also be used for developing the Army's next generation of tactical trucks, as part of the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Modernization Strategy. Funding in this Program Element (PE) supports the Family of Heavy Trucks to include active safety technologies, periodic evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection as described in the Long Term Protection Strategy (LTPS), and heavy tactical trailer development.\n\nFY 2018 Project 659 Base funds in the amount of $0.900 million will be used to complete Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter (EHET) documentation and pre-Materiel Development Decision (pre-MDD) efforts, as well as, beginning pre-Milestone B efforts.\n\nFY2018 Project E50 Base funds in the amount of $3.850 million will be used to conduct Semi Trailer Low Bed (STLB) limited performance and reliability testing, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), and Systems Engineering Program Management (SEPM) support.\n\nFY 2018 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $5.757 million will be used to develop Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) armor; design, prototype and test axle, suspension and weapon station upgrades for the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck A4 (HEMTTA4) and Palletized Load System A1 (PLSA1); convert the HEMTTA4\/PLSA1 Underbody Armor Kit Technical Data Package (TDP) from Prototype-level to Production-level; and SEPM support."

The STLB is interoperable with a variety of trucks residing across the U.S. Army equipment inventory. The STLB will be introduced into a theater of operations to transport construction equipment (CE) employed by U.S. Army Engineers to execute horizontal and vertical construction projects in support of U.S. Military or other national goals and objectives. The STLB is employed to transport CE, miscellaneous equipment, disabled equipment, Class IV (construction materials), and logistical provisions. The STLB supports units in the execution of the following tasks: expand the lodgment, construction\/upgrade\/rehabilitation and maintenance of main supply routes (MSR), alternate supply routes (ASR), logistical facilities, bituminous roads, helipads, airfields, landing strips, motor pools, parking areas, etc. These types of facilities are required for sustainment operations during decisive action operations. The STLB will also be used during routine exercises\/deployments, disaster relief, and other nation building operations. The STLB will be capable of supporting mobility, counter mobility, survivability, counter improvised and sustainment needs and all applicable North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) interoperability criteria. The current 25-ton semi-trailers were manufactured in the 1968 to 1975 timeframe with an average age of 42 to 49 years. The Economic Useful Life (EUL) of the current trailer is 30-years. The existing semi-trailers have far exceeded their EUL and are becoming increasingly difficult to support due to spare parts obsolescence, resulting in decreased readiness.\n\nFY18 Base funds in the amount of $3.850 million will be used to fund STLB limited performance and reliability testing, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), and Systems Engineering\/Program Management (SEPM) support."

                            "val": "This program element supports periodic, evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection for Heavy Tactical Vehicles (HTV) and Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTV) as described in the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) Strategy and individual variants' Capability Production Documents.  The upgrades will leverage the Army Technology Objective's (ATO) survivability and Army Research Laboratory's (ARL) research and development activities to develop and evaluate kits which increase the protection level of all HTVs to the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) protection level as well as anticipating changing threat environments, protection gaps, or improving the operating performance, efficiency, and reliability through armor weight reduction. This Program Element (PE) also supports increasing crew protection by leveraging advancements in autonomous ground vehicle technology via development and evaluation of autonomous applique kits that can be applied to the current and future HTV fleet.\n\nThe Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) supports construction projects by loading, transporting and dumping payloads of sand and gravel aggregates, crushed rock, hot asphalt mixes, earth, clay, rubble, large boulders and other materials up to gross vehicle weight rating to job sites under world-wide climatic conditions.  The HDT also serves as a quarry truck for the quick transport of bulk raw earth material to and from the crushing, screening and washing plant and the asphalt mixing plant.  The HDT also serves as a transportation asset for organizational equipment.  The HDT is Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) compliant with MRAP 1.1 underbody protection.\n\nHeavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck A4 (HEMTTA4) and Palletized Load System A1 (PLSA1) Suspension and Weapon Station Upgrade - There have been several survivability enhancements that have occurred since the HEMTT and PLS truck production program began. These enhancements did not incorporate measures to correct for automotive performance degradation that has occurred due to the additional mass of the survivability enhancements. Currently the HEMTTA4 and PLSA1 with top, side, underbody, fuel tank and RPG protection as well as the addition of a weapon station have overloaded the truck axles by 10-15% or more. To regain the original design performance and safety factors, new suspension components are required. \n\nHEMTTA4\/PLSA1 Underbody Armor Kit Technical Data Package (TDP) Conversion from Prototype-level to Production-level - HEMTTA4\/PLS A1 Underbody Kits provide an MRAP-level of underbody blast protection for the HEMTT Fleet and was developed in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS).  The kit contains additional underbody armor, blast attenuating seats, and energy absorbent flooring; adding 2,550 lbs. to the vehicle. This underbody armor kit augments the existing top and side B-Kit armor. HEMTT and PLS share a common cab design, therefore, the Underbody Armor Kit can be applied to both trucks. The conversion effort is required to procure kits in the future.\n\nThe M915A5 tractor truck manufactured by Daimler Trucks North America LLC is a prime mover of flatbed and tanker semi-trailers used primarily to transport containers, bulk cargo and petroleum products over primary and secondary roads and trails under worldwide climatic conditions. It has a diesel engine, automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, and a fully sliding 36 inch fifth wheel. It has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 66,000 lbs and is compatible with the following trailers: M872 (34-ton flatbed trailer), M871 (22-1\/2 ton flatbed trailer), M127 (12-ton stake trailer), M967\/969 (5000-gallon trailer), M1062 (7500-gallon trailer), M1062A1 (9200-gallon trailer), MILVAN, and commercial trailers. The M915A5 has two configurations, a base armor-ready A-Cab and an up-armored B-Kit. M915A5 underbody Protection Kits are required to protect the line haul fleet from current and future threats and add protection to the B-kit configuration.\n\nFY 2018 Project VR5 Base funds in the amount of $5.757 million will be used to develop Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) armor.  It will also be used to fund the design, prototype, and testing of axle\/suspension\/weapon station upgrades for the HEMTTA4\/PLSA1. To include the conversion of the HEMTTA4\/PLSA1 Underbody Armor Kit TDP from Prototype-level to Production-level and Systems Engineering\/Program Management (SEPM) support."

All technical requirements are tested and confirmed prior to start of production.  In addition, each program has the ability to perform added tests during production as required to assure technical requirements are being met. The product office also uses Project Recon to perform risk management. The tool is designed to capture, manage, and link Risks, Issues, and Opportunities in a centralized database to create an integrated model that covers the entire program lifecycle."

            "val": "JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army is the lead service.  The JLTV goal is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles designed to provide protected, sustained, and networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO).  JLTV objectives include increased performance, protection, and payload over the current legacy HMMWV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized. \n\nFunding supports modernization of the current Tactical Wheeled Vehicle fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.\n\nMajor FY20 budget activities include evaluation and assessment to improve reliability, reduce operational and sustainment (O&S) costs, or provide incremental upgrades to the base platform. These include: Li-Ion based technologies and mainstream DoD efforts to optimize the JLTV energy storage system architecture and drastically reduce (O&S) costs; acoustic and thermal signature mitigation technologies; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) system packaging optimization efforts; integration of future weapon systems (i.e. Howitzer M119A3); integration of Ground Base Air Defense (GBAD), assured Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT), Handheld Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) Block 2, Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS); tire solutions that provide more robust sidewalls while also providing optimal tire deflection; and Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulation (TADSS)."

The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead.\n\nThe JLTV Program entered the Production and Deployment Phase with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorization on 25 August 2015.  With Milestone C approval, the LRIP fixed price contract was awarded to Oshkosh Defense LLC on 25 August 2015.  This contract consists of a three year LRIP period with options for five additional years of FRP deliveries.  JPO JLTV requested separately priced firm fixed price (FFP) option(s) for purchase of the Technical Data Package (TDP) with appropriate data rights to allow for possible future competition for production vehicles and spares. \n\nDuring the LRIP phase, JPO JLTV will continue to produce production vehicles for extensive Test and Evaluation activities to support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision.  A ramp up of JLTV quantities will continue to support fielding to U.S. Army and USMC units once the FRP decision is achieved and allow the program to transition into FRP.\n\nIn support of a FRP decision, by the end of March 2019, the Program Manager (PM) is to provide test vehicles to Army Futures Command (AFC) and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) for evaluation of situational awareness optimal solution sets to include larger door windows with and without camera mix.  Improvements for noise reductions both internal and external, to include mufflers, alternator isolation and new design on gears for gear box, trans-axle and wheel ends are desired to be included with soldier feedback assessment with situational awareness.  Additionally, the PM is to provide a cost estimate for troop seats to include automotive style seat belts with integrated roll-over protection.  United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is tasked to review requirements for JLTV trailer to specified type units.  Decision brief on JLTV performance improvements is to be provided to senior leaders no later than May 2019.\n\nThe JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with U.S. Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships. The JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the systems Life Cycle."

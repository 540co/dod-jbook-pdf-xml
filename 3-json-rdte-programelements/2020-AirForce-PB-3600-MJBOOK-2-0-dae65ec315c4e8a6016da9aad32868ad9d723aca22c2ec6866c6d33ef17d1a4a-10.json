Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces. The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. These functions are accomplished through the NC3 system of systems.\n\nThe NC3 system of systems provides connectivity from the President or Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System (NMCS) to nuclear execution forces worldwide. To enhance NC3 mission success, the AF formalized AF NC3 elements as a specified AF Weapon System (WS), AN\/USQ-225.  Activities funded in this Program integrate legacy systems, ongoing NC3 programs, and future capabilities for the overall AF NC3 WS.  \n\nThe AF Nuclear Weapon Center NC3 Integration Directorate (AFNWC\/NC) will ensure current, new, and future NC3 capabilities are fully integrated as part of the Air Force's overall effort to sustain, modernize, and recapitalize the nuclear enterprise.  AFNWC\/NC will be responsible for integrating NC3 materiel management across Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) to include authority and responsibility for weapon system architecture, weapon system configuration management, weapon system state-of-health reporting, risk management, supply chain management, overall integration, system test, verification, and certification.  AFNWC\/NC is responsible for defining, building, and sustaining current and future AF NC3 WS system of systems configuration baselines, and marshaling necessary Supporting Centers in AFMC and other units\/agencies in the Air Force and the Department of Defense (DoD) to support and\/or accomplish these tasks.  AFNWC\/NC will collaborate with AFMC Supporting Centers to champion the full spectrum of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) efforts, in support of Air Force Global Strike Command as the Lead Command championing NDO requirements for all Combatant Commands. \n\nThis program funds activities for integrating AF NC3 WS materiel, authority, and responsibility for the AF NC3 WS architecture, modeling, simulation, configuration management, risk management, weapon system state-of-health reporting, supply chain supportability and risk management, and overall AF NC3 WS integration, development, system test, verification, fielding, and certification.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

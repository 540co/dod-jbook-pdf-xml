The DIB's report made recommendations aimed at transforming the way the Department acquires, develops, and deploys software and manages digital talent. The DIB encouraged the creation of a \"new appropriation category for software capability delivery that allows (relevant types of) software to be funded as a single budget item, with no separation between RDT&E, production and sustainment.\" The recommendation stemmed from the DIB's observation that current law, regulations, and policies (including those governing program funding and appropriations) treat software acquisition and development as a series of discrete, sequential steps; and that this approach is at odds with modern software, which is continuously updated to provide new functionality.  This program has been designated as a Software and Digital Technology Pilot Program by the Secretary of Defense or the explanatory statement regarding this Act.  The funding in this line is requested to be used for expenses necessary for agile procurement, production, modification and operation and maintenance of the pilot program requirements.\n\n\n(Proj 3323) Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2): is a next generation Command and Control (C2) software program that will deliver Battle Management Aids (BMA) and Maritime Planning Tools (MPT) to dynamically plan, direct, monitor, and assess maritime operations in support of Joint, Multi-Service, and Coalition Force planning.  MTC2 will leverage a System of Services (SoServ) to deliver capabilities improving decision speed and dynamic synchronization of forces.  BMAs \/ MPTs are small, capability-focused deliveries that can be rapidly developed, tested, and fielded.  MTC2 will engage with the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV)-led and Fleet supported Requirements Governance Board (RGB) to define and prioritize the BMAs and MPTs that MTC2 will deliver and align to the Program Executive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C4I) enterprise architecture Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise Service (CANES), Agile Core Services (ACS)) for fielding to all echelons of command (Afloat and Ashore) within the Navy.  The program's objective is to provide a suite of maritime applications (BMAs \/ MPTs) that enable planning, execution, monitoring, and assessment in support of operational and tactical level of war requirements.  MTC2 will field BMAs \/ MPTs designed to provide automated and structured support for tactical and operational planning, decision-making, and execution.  MTC2 will incorporate distributed data transfer capability for enhanced operational data exchange between command and control systems, combat systems, logistics, and intelligence systems for timely threat identification, location, and status alongside blue force data.  MTC2 is the Navy's only solution to fulfill a portion of the Joint Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) Allocation requirements.  GFM-DI is the Department-wide enterprise solution that enables visibility\/accessibility\/sharing of data applicable to the entire Department of Defense (DoD) force structure. MTC2 supports alignment and provides interoperability of Navy C2 with the DoD joint C2 way-forward.  The program will fully align with joint C2 data and service exposure and consumption goals, architectures, and Net-Centric Enterprise Service efforts. The sustainment activities include support for evolutionary acquisition, program management, training and training events, help desk, procuring software licenses, and sustaining MTC2 Prototype instances until migration to MTC2 Program of Record."

Data feeds integrated into MTC2 will be displayed seamlessly on a single display for fleet users which will require ongoing Human Factors Engineering (HFE) in addition to development, integration, and test. MTC2 will continue to host fleet users in working sessions and incorporate HFE and development updates for BMA \/ MPT improvements. MTC2 will target demonstrations of capabilities at Trident Warrior (TW) 20. MTC2 will continue integration and testing of Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) capabilities for transition into the MTC2 software baseline for fielding.  Capability Drop 2 was defined in the MTC2 RGB Prioritized Focus Areas (signed 16 March 2018) to provide Navy Dynamic Organization to Joint Global Force Management (GFM) community.  This capability drop has been accelerated to meet the Joint Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) Allocation  mandate to Full Operational Capability (FOC) by FY 2020."

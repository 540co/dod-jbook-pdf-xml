To meet these goals, this budget activity addresses cyber security and resiliency gaps in: the skills of the acquisition workforce by increasing skills, knowledge, and experience of the organic workforce; the system security engineering activities by integrating cyber security into the system engineering policy, products, and processes; actionable intelligence by improving the requirements for collecting cyber threat information to weapon systems as well as the skills for intelligence analysts to identify critical information to be passed to the acquisition community; a common security environment by leveraging information technology capabilities to accommodate a protected median for sharing information about weapon system cyber susceptibilities and vulnerabilities; standards for designing new weapon systems by defining a government reference architecture which provides future weapon system designers the opportunity use open system architectures; cyber security\/resiliency of fielded weapon systems by designing mitigations strategies and identifying requirements for known vulnerabilities; having a mission focused analysis for identifying critical subsystem and support system needing additional cyber security and resiliency by delivering a systematic approach for looking across weapon systems used to achieve each and every Air Force mission.\n\nIn CY, project 642816, Agile\/Adaptable Standards, is a new start.\nIn CY, project 642834, Mission Assurance for fielded Systems, is a new start.\nIn CY, project 642836, Mission Thread Analysis, is a new start.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Each evaluation will identify cyber risks to users, weapon systems, and missions (from most to least likely) in Air Force operations which will be fed back to the appropriate acquisition Program Executive Offices, Program Offices, and MAJCOMs as well as to policy, processes, products, and people accordingly. Highlighted in a complete cyber mission thread analysis will be critical systems, subsystems, and\/or support systems that require increased cyber resiliency to ensure Air Force weapon systems can fight \"In-Thru-From\" a cyber contested environment."

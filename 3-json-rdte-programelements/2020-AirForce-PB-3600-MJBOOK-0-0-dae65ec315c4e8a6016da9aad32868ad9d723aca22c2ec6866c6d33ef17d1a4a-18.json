It also develops and demonstrates radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means. This program develops the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It provides aerospace platforms with the capability to precisely detect, track, and target both airborne (conventional and low radar cross-section) and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets in adverse clutter and jamming environments.  Project activities include developing multi-function radio-frequency systems including radar and electronic warfare technology and the position and timing information to enable distributed sensing.  Desired warfighting capabilities include the ability to detect concealed targets in difficult background conditions."

This project also conducts advanced investigations to determine solution credibility, in terms of underlying technology and in terms of consistency with future Air Force missions within highly contested environments.  This project includes robust techniques to support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and targeting missions within adverse weather conditions and against adversaries employing deceptive techniques.  This project includes development of software-intensive solutions suitable for cloud-based integration and for development\/operations-like operational environments.  This project develops technology for effective management of online and offline information sources incorporating both constrained and cooperative sensing.  In FY 2020, this project was realigned to better reflect technical areas being emphasized such as autonomy, multi-domain and multi-sensor information processing, leverage of machine learning developments and enterprise-level modeling, simulation and analysis."

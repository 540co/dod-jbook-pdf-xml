Builds software infrastructure in accordance with a modular open systems approach (MOSA); more specifically, this open software architecture will strictly adhere to the Future Airborne Computing Environment (FACE) and UAS Control Segment (UCS) standards.  This software will also support emerging Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) and Scalable Control Interface (SCI) requirements.\n\nCurrent Universal Products consist of the UGCS, the Universal Ground Data Terminal (UGDT) and the Universal Mission Simulator (UMS).  The Universal Products will be capable of flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems.  UGCS is protected in a climate-controlled, standard S-280 or S-788 U.S. Army shelter and mounted on either a standard Army FMTV or HMMWV, the UGCS commands multi-UAS missions by controlling flight as well as receiving and disseminating battlefield video and situational awareness data through state-of-the-art operator consoles (UAS Cockpit).  Consoles can be used to provide aircraft command and control, payload control and weapons launch.  Future GCS modifications will allow scaled down sizes of GCS to support expeditionary operations.\n\nThe UGDT provides a Line of Sight (LOS) capability for transmit and receipt of UAS command and control and UAS payload products.  The UGDT is the common datalink system for U. S. Army UAS.\n\nThe Universal Mission Simulator (UMS) consists of the hardware and software required to fully train UAS operators to full Readiness Level (RL) 1, IAW Army aviation standards.  The UMS will be capable of training and simulating flight and payload control of [Directorate of Simulation (DOS)] Shadow and Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft systems.\n\nThe OSRVT Increment II consists of a Remote Operations Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER), Miltope tablet, Antennas, UHF Modem, Type I encryption, Ku-Directional Antennas (KuDA) with an On-The-Move (OTM) capable variant, and an extended range Mobile Directional Antennas System (MDAS). Software supports decoding Telemetry Data from multiple Manned\/Unmanned Aircraft Systems, provides Electro-Optical (EO)\/Infrared (IR) payload control, and supports off-target calculations. OSRVT supports current operations and emerging requirements.\n\nJustification: FY2020 Universal Product Base funding of $32.016M will be used for continuing the development of modifications needed to address UGCS modernization utilizing MOSA, maintain interoperability, increase commonality for the Family of UAS, Gray Eagle (MQ-1C), and Shadow (RQ-7) programs of record as well as SCI including Systems Engineering, Logistics, and Program Management."

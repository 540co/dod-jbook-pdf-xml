            "val": "This Program Element (PE) advances engineering state of the practice, and complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including systems engineering (SE) research, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems.\n\nThis PE increases lethality and supports Department business reform (National Defense Strategy Lines of Effort 1 and 3 respectively).  Improvements to the Department's systems engineering capabilities ensure we quickly and affordably field a lethal Joint Force by addressing dependencies in system and mission capabilities, rapidly evolving technologies, lifecycle considerations, and resource limitations in the face of dynamic threats and missions.  \n\nIn FY 2021, DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO) funding Modeling and Simulation (M&S) activities will transition to Systems Engineering (Program Element 0605142D8Z).\n\nThe Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to conduct systems research and improve the Department\u2019s ability to develop and deploy complex weapon systems.  The SERC consists of a network of 22 research universities from across the U.S. working collaboratively to bring the best academic talent in the nation to bear on DoD\u2019s systems engineering research problems.  During FY 2021, SERC funding will be reduced to realign activities to the Department\u2019s modernization priorities.  The SERC will complete R&E funded projects started in prior fiscal years and R&E will establish a business model to sustain the SERC\u2019s network of universities for utilization by other DoD components.  In addition, following the realignment of FY 2021 resources, approximately $2.000 million of Systems Engineering (0605142D8Z) resources will be used to sustain SERC operations for continued support of Service funded projects. \n\nThe Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) project reduces the risk in development of future weapon systems and ensures warfighter success through better-informed acquisition decisions.  ERS integrates high-fidelity, physics-based modeling with advanced analytic tools to enable rapid design and analysis of current and future weapon systems.  Through the use of high-performance computing, optimized computational tools, and improved processes and methods, ERS enables faster evaluation of system performance, systems-of-systems analysis, and system evaluation within operationally relevant environments to complement and reduce costly physical testing.  In order to focus ERS efforts on the Department\u2019s modernization priorities, ERS project funding will transition in FY 2021 to Systems Engineering (Program Element 0605142D8Z).  With further ERS advances from a development project to an enduring support capability, this shift will better align with the purpose of research funded by projects associated with Systems Engineering.  This change directly orients the previously developed capabilities to address modernization efforts driven by the National Defense Strategy."

The first 40 days is to complete the investigative phase and the remaining 20 days is to complete the adjudicative phase of the clearance review. In addition to national security clearance determinations, DISS supports Suitability and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) credentialing eligibility compliance across the Department of Defense (DoD). The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRTPA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce. \n\nThe DISS is comprised of two key application components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS). Currently, CATS is deployed in multiple versions (V1-V3) at the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF); whereas the CATS component of DISS will upgrade CATS (V1-V3) technology stack and consolidate capabilities into a single baseline in FY2017. CATS (V1-V3) are operational fulfilling the requirements to receive background investigations and adjudicate national security, suitability and HSPD12 credentialing eligibility determinations via electronic and human adjudication processes. Historically, CATS electronically rendered favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret-level cases. New Tier 3 e-Adjudication business rules for access to Secret information were approved in September 2016. JVS will be used by the security management community to manage subject's access to information based on eligibility, communicate with the CAF, manage subject incidents, and additional subject details such as reporting, travel, and relationships. The DISS will incrementally deploy additional capabilities to address functionality gaps between DISS and the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). DISS will enable consistent standards throughout the collateral DoD Personnel Security, Suitability and HSPD12 mission areas. CATS (V1-V3) instances and JPAS, once fully replaced by DISS, will be decommissioned. JPAS is projected to be decommissioned in FY2019 but this may be adjusted based upon DISS deployments."

The July 11, 2014 \u201cDISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum\u201d revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The  JVS Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed in FY15 Q2 and this initiated the Engineering Development phase in which the program will refine system requirements, configure the software, build functionality, conduct developmental testing, and plan for operational testing.  These activities will continue until a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) is made.\n\nThe DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities. DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program\u2019s acquisition approach."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  \n\nWithin the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."

It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD\u2019s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting. As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer. Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nToday, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets. These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies. These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information. Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant. Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information. The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices. They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw\nconclusions. Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.\n\nThere is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements. The Comptroller\u2019s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.\n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress."

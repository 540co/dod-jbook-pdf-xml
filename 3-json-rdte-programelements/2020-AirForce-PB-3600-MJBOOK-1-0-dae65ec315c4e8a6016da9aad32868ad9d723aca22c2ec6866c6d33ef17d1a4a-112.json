Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, acquisition process improvement analysis, and developing and managing a technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. These efforts provide stability in Air Force Acquisition by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.\n\nThe FY2020 funding request was reduced by $12.387 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, acquisition process improvement analysis, and developing and managing a technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. These efforts provide stability in Air Force Acquisition by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data."

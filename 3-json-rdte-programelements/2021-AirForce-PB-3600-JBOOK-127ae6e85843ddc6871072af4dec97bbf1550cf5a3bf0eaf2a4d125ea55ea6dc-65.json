                            "val": "The HH-60W program will replace the aging HH-60G. The HH-60G currently supports the Air Force's core function of Personnel Recovery.  The primary mission of the HH-60G is to conduct day \/ night \/ marginal weather Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) in order to recover downed aircrew or other isolated personnel in hostile or non-permissive environments.\n\nThe HH-60W will be capable of employment day or night, in adverse weather, and across the full spectrum of threats to include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear.  Onboard defensive capabilities will permit the HH-60W system to operate with less risk than legacy systems in an increased threat environment.  An in-flight air refueling capability will provide an airborne alert capability and extend its combat mission range.  The HH-60W system is capable of conducting combat search and rescue airborne mission commander duties.  The aircraft will be self-supporting to the maximum extent practical.  The HH-60W system may also conduct other collateral missions inherent in their capabilities to conduct Personnel Recovery, such as non-conventional assisted recovery, non-conventional evacuation operations, defense support to civil authorities, civil search and rescue, international aid, emergency aeromedical evacuation, disaster\/humanitarian relief, counterdrug activities, support for National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight operations, and insertion\/extraction of combat forces.  \n\nThe HH-60W development program will procure a total of ten aircraft as follows: four Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) aircraft, five System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) aircraft, and one modernization flight test aircraft. The FY20 PB added the modernization flight test aircraft.  In addition, the HH-60W program office will procure necessary ground and flight assets required for both Development Test (DT) and Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E).  The HH-60W EMD program includes development of the complete HH-60W training system to include HH-60W Weapon System Trainer (WST), Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), Airframe Systems Trainer (AST), Avionics Desktop Trainer (AVDTT), other training devices, with associated spares and support equipment, as well as Type 1 training and courseware required to perform flight, aircrew and maintenance training.  Other development efforts include a systems integration laboratory, an avionics integration support facility, procurement of data rights and licenses, spares, SDTA aircraft, Government test, and product support.  The HH-60W program will also pursue modernization efforts to develop and integrate enhancements in mission\/defensive systems and additional system upgrades to address critical capability gaps.  The program office will utilize the additional flight test aircraft in support of modernization efforts, including Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) testing, to address emerging threats and evolving mission needs.\n\nThe Delta Training Device (DTD) effort will procure additional training assets, including but not limited to, maintenance Crew Chief Part Task Trainers (CCPTT) and aircrew Hoist Procedural Trainers (HPT) with associated spares and support equipment, as well as Type 1 training.\n\nCapability upgrade and modernization development efforts for the HH-60W include, but are not limited to, the following priorities: Situational Awareness Data Link\/Automatic Direction Finder Removal, Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasures, Electro Optical\/Infrared Tactical Overlay, Global Positioning System Anti-Jam\/Anti-Spoof, Degraded Visual Environment system, Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring System Control, Video Data Link, Radio Frequency Jammer, Electronic Flight Bags, and Automated Dependent Surveillance Broadcast - In Device.  Capability upgrade and modernization also supports inclusion for mandates, hardware changes for diminishing manufacturing sources and Deficiency Report Resolutions.  In addition, studies, development, prototyping, testing and integration of emerging technology and support equipment opportunities to increase the effectiveness of the platform are considered in capability upgrade and modernization initiatives.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver HH-60W weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

In addition, the HH-60W program office will procure necessary ground and flight assets required for both DT and IOT&E.  The FY20 PB added a modernization flight test aircraft.\n  \nThe main HH-60W program includes development of the complete HH-60W system to include delivery of ten aircraft, associated training systems, to include Weapon System Trainer (WST), Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), Avionics Desktop Trainer (AVDTT), Airframe Systems Trainer (AST), other Part Task Trainers, with associated spares and support elements\/equipment, as well as Type 1 training and courseware required to perform flight, aircrew and maintenance training.  An additional prime contract was awarded to develop and acquire additional training devices. Other efforts include, but are not limited to, development of a systems integration laboratory and an avionics integration support facility, as well as procurement of data rights and licenses, spares, SDTA and product support for the EMD effort. The HH-60W modernization effort will accelerate fielding of capability upgrades, where possible, while still in production, minimizing the need for future post-production modifications.\n\nThe current contract types for this effort are predominantly Fixed Price.  As originally planned following source selection, a formal HH-60W Training System Requirements Analysis (TSRA) was completed in Sep 2015.  This analysis identified additional training requirements not accounted for in the original contract. These additional training devices, associated spares, support equipment, Type 1 Training and initial contractor support was competitively awarded in Aug 18."

            "val": "TACPs are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations.  These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Center (ASOC) TACPs, Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and dismounted Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. TACPs coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols \n \nThe purpose of the Tactical Air Control Party - Modernization (TACP-M) program is to provide TACPs voice, data and video communications, targeting and battlefield awareness capabilities. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communication\n\nThe TACP-M program support includes addressing frequent TACP combat deployments that sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments.  The TACP-M program works closely with the Battlefield Airmen Office (BAO) program to procure dismounted equipment. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities. \n\nThe TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following four major areas: (1) ASOC\/TOC systems (used in fixed operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles), (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. \n\nCASS software provides advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. TACP CASS software enables digital data communications with joint Command and Control (C2) nodes, other TACPs, attack aircraft, and Army C2 and Fire Support systems. It includes interfaces with TOC, ASOC, and JTAC radios, and targeting devices. It also provides battlespace awareness capabilities needed to plan, request, coordinate, and control CAS in support of ground maneuver forces.  The CASS software interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F\/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems \/ nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). \n\nThe software is in two versions: Dismounted and ASOC\/TOC\/Mounted (ATM).  Both software support a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN\/PRC-117F, AN\/PRC-117G, AN\/ PRC-148, AN\/PRC-152A, AN\/PRC-154, AN\/PRC-158, AN\/PRC-161, AN\/PRC-163, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN\/PRC-150C, AN\/PRC-160 and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future).  Future upgrades are necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms.  CASS upgrades provide a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new external devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements\n\nFunding increases include support for Dismount and ATM software to address interfaces with new android dismount software, changes to Army fires support systems, changes to Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), updates for fielded versions, new joint Digitally-Aided CAS (DACAS) standards, and technical support to operators employing the software.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "TACPs are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations.  These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Center (ASOC) TACPs, Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and dismounted Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. TACPs coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.  \n\nThe purpose of the Tactical Air Control Party - Modernization (TACP-M) program is to provide TACPs voice, data and video communications, targeting and battlefield awareness capabilities. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications.\n\nThe TACP-M program support includes addressing frequent TACP combat deployments that sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments.  The TACP-M program works closely with the Battlefield Airmen Office (BAO) program to procure dismounted equipment. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities. \n\nThe TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following four major areas: (1) ASOC\/TOC systems (used in fixed operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles), (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software\n\nCASS software provides advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. TACP CASS software enables digital data communications with joint Command and Control (C2) nodes, other TACPs, attack aircraft, and Army C2 and Fire Support systems. It includes interfaces with TOC, ASOC, and JTAC radios, and targeting devices. It also provides battlespace awareness capabilities needed to plan, request, coordinate, and control CAS in support of ground maneuver forces.  The CASS software interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F\/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems \/ nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). \n The software is in two versions: Dismounted and ASOC\/TOC\/Mounted (ATM).  Both software support a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN\/PRC-117F, AN\/PRC-117G, AN\/ PRC-148, AN\/PRC-152A, AN\/PRC-154, AN\/PRC-158, AN\/PRC-161, AN\/PRC-163, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN\/PRC-150C, AN\/PRC-160 and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future).  Future upgrades are necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms.  CASS upgrades provide a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new external devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements. \n\nFunding increases include support for Dismount and ATM software to address interfaces with new android dismount software, changes to Army fires support systems, changes to Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), updates for fielded versions, new joint Digitally-Aided CAS (DACAS) standards, and technical support to operators employing the software."

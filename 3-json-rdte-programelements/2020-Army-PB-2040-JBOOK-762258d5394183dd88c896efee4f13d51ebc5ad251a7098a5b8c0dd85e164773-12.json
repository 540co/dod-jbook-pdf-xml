These Projects support multi-fuel, rapidly deployable field food service equipment initiatives. Efforts also support the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of programs to improve equipment, enhance safety in food service, and decrease fuel and water requirements. The Projects develop critical enablers that support the Joint Future Capabilities and Joint Expeditionary mindset, by maintaining readiness through integrating new equipment, enhancing the field soldier's well-being, and providing soldiers usable equipment. The Projects also reduce sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands on lift, the combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.\n\n\nThis PE\/Project supports Field Feeding programs for all the services."

Efforts also support the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of programs to improve equipment, enhance safety in food service, and decrease fuel and water requirements. The Projects develop critical enablers that support the Army's Strategic Planning Guidance by developing and integrating critical expeditionary capabilities that maintain readiness, providing effective solutions that reduce the resource and operational energy footprint, providing modernized equipment, and enhancing the field Soldier's well being. This project reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands on lift, the combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.\n\n\nThis PE\/Project supports Field Feeding programs for the Army."

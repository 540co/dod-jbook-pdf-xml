DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive computational capabilities to demonstrate and mature emerging technologies that address the supercomputing requirements of the DoD RDTE community in the areas of hardware, software, and programming environments. All HPCMP sites are interconnected to each other, the DoD High Performance Computing (HPC) RDTE community, and other major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which investigates, demonstrates, and matures (a) state-of-the-art digital networking technologies to ensure a robust distributed environment and (b) the most advanced digital security capabilities to protect the intellectual property of the DoD and its contract entities as they employ HPCMP capabilities. The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.\n\nWork in this Program Element (PE) supports the Army Science and Technology Environment and Terrain Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

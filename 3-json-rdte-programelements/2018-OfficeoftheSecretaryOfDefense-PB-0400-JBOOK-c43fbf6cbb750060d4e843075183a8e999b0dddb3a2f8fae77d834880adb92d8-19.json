The JCTD program engages the interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the Department of Defense's (DoD) access to innovation.  It serves as the vehicle for CCMDs and Services to address strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment as identified by the Chairman\u2019s Gap Assessment, Services science and technology roadmaps and other senior level guidance.  \n\nJCTD projects are executed in the following focus areas: electromagnetic spectrum maneuver; space capability resilience; autonomous systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, asymmetric force application and information operations and analytics.  The objective is to maintain U.S. technological superiority across the range of military operations.  The JCTD program achieves this objective by reducing the cost of operations, and allowing for the rapid insertion of new capabilities within two to four years."

            "val": "JCTD funding is used to address near and mid-term CCMD and Joint Forces capability gaps.  It provides a mechanism for DoD-wide prototyping and demonstration of game-changing technologies in operationally relevant environments.  In FY 2016, the JCTD Program successfully completed the military utility assessment and transition of several JCTD prototypes that fielded affordable and sustainable solutions to meet immediate operational needs.  \n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n\n\u2022\tCreate a bridge from science and technology to operational use and formal acquisition.\n\n\u2022\tAccelerate fielding of decisive technical capabilities while mitigating operational risk to the warfighter.\n\n\u2022\tLeverage open architectures to enhance interoperability and promote affordability.\n\n\u2022\tThe JCTD program delivers capabilities far quicker than the traditional DoD planning, programming, budgeting, and execution (PPBE) process.  Recent examples include: \n\n     1.  The Advanced Weapons Enhanced by Submarine Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) against Mobile Targets (AWESUM) JCTD.  The AWESUM JCTD developed a three inch diameter unmanned aerial system (UAS).  The UAS is deployed from submarine countermeasure launchers.  UAS control and sensor feeds are fully integrated into the submarine combat control system enabling rapid development of fire control solutions for torpedo and third party targeting, and battle damage assessment following engagements.  AWESUM transitioned to U.S. Navy submarines in 2016.\n\n     2.  In support of the Army Robotic Systems Joint Program Office, the Autonomous Mobility Applique Systems (AMAS) JCTD successfully developed, demonstrated and transitioned autonomous capabilities to the U.S. Army Route Clearance and Integration System Program of Record (PoR) that will be incorporated into existing Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) program of record.  AMAS has completely changed the Army\u2019s future ground robotics plans and requirements and will have a lasting impact on future ground autonomous programs through the application of lessons learned and capability from the AMAS JCTD.\n\n     3.  The High Speed Container Delivery System (HSCDS) JCTD developed a parachute system to offload up to eight container delivery system bundles at an elevation of 250 feet and 250 knots from C-130J and C-17 aircraft.  This has significantly improved the accuracy of existing delivery systems while providing increased safety for the aircraft and friendly ground forces.  HSCDS transitioned to the Army\u2019s Product Manager for Force Sustainment Systems, has been extensively used in Afghanistan and used to deliver humanitarian assistance to Yazidi people on Mount Sinjar, Iraq.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:\n  \n\u2022 JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within two to four years. \n\u2022 The JCTD program will continue to achieve high transition rates.  In FY 2016, 88 percent of completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.  Seven of sixteen completed JCTDs transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record.  Seven transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  Two were returned to the technology base for further analysis and\/or future use."

The intent of PIER is to assure continued logistics resiliency and freedom for our U.S. Forces to maneuver and conduct agile strategic sealift and logistics.

(1) CCMD Direct Support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project development, demonstration, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling the CCMDs to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase due to Service or Agency commitments.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.

In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  \n-  The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.

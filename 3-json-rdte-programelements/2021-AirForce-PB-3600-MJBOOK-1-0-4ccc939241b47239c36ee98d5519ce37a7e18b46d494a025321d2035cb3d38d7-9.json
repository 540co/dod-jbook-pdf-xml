This Program addresses capability needs in airbase defense, precision strike and aircraft protect capabilities. The Directed Energy Prototyping Program bridges the gap between lab based technology demonstration under a controlled environment, and demonstration of a system in realistic environments with the intent of establishing successful acquisition, and operation or operational capability implementation.\n\nThis prototyping effort enables the ability to integrate the prototype systems with other operational systems required for the mission, conduct test and evaluation activities, and modify emerging directed energy technology systems based on prototyping activities to enable rapid fielding to the warfighter. The Directed Energy Prototyping Program allows acquisition program managers (capability developers) and warfighters (capability recipients and end users) to prototype, integrate, evaluate, and demonstrate candidate weapon technologies and assess them in an operational environment in partnership with Program Executive officers, schoolhouses, simulation facilities, major commands, combatant commands, and developmental planning organizations. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Directed Energy Prototyping weapon systems. It may also include necessary civilian pay expenses required to perform analysis and developmental activities required in support of the transition of weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

            "val": "Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. The Department of Defense (DOD) established FVL to focus vertical lift capabilities and technology development as well as retain long-term industrial base capabilities. The Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan in 2012 to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, the Army identified FVL as one of the Army's six modernization priorities, and established the FVL Cross Functional Team. The FVL objectives are increased vertical lift maneuverability, range, speed, payload, survivability, and reliability while reducing the logistical footprint.  This capability will provide critical aviation support to the joint warfighter and maneuver force. FVL will integrate advanced technologies and design configurations with appropriate trades to ensure affordability."

The Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Capability Set One competitive prototyping effort was initiated in FY 2019 with a Congressional Add on Project B47 Future Vertical Lift.   In FY 2020, FARA funds are requested under Project F12 Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.\n\nFLRAA FY 2020 budget increased by $75.6 million for Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction efforts and $5 million for university partnership efforts. FARA FY 2020 budget decreased by $34.0 million to align with current Competitive Prototyping efforts. FLRAA budget increase of $5 million for university partnership efforts is aligned incorrectly to Project F12 Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.  This funding will be correctly re-aligned to Project B47 Future Vertical Lift for execution.  \n\nFLRAA FY 2021 budget increased by $112.369 million for continued execution of Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction efforts, development of the Contract Requirements Package, and initiation of the Source Selection Evaluation Board and the FARA FY 2021 budget decreased by $0.499 million."

The FLRAA weapon system will retain the Army's ability to project combat power with significantly increased range, speed, mobility, and payload over current Army and USSOCOM aircraft. FLRAA achieved a Materiel Development Decision approval in October 2016 and the Office of Secretary of Defense granted a sufficiency determination of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in July 2019. Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funded completion of the AoA, continued to support initiation of program documentation, and funded establishment of an FVL Architecture Risk Reduction effort in support of Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) for both FLRAA and the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. FY 2020 funding will support continuation of the FVL Architecture Risk Reduction effort; support life cycle affordability efforts; initiate planning and proposal evaluations of the Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction efforts; and support the completion of key program documents to include the Program Strategy, Weapon System Specification, Systems Engineering Plan, Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) and Contract Requirements Package (CRP). FY 2021 funding supports the continued execution of the Competitive Demonstration Risk Reduction and MOSA efforts, development of the CRP, and the initiation of Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB)."

In order to support the Army's modernization strategy and concept for multi-domain operations, the FLRAA program will deliver a first unit equipped in FY 2030.  This accelerated approach builds on the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR-TD) efforts (ongoing since 2013); the Army's AoA (completed in July 2019); and multiple ongoing risk mitigation efforts.\n\nThe Army's risk mitigation activities ahead of the Program of Record (PoR) include: (1) additional conceptual design and flight envelop expansion tasks on the four existing JMR-TD Technology Investment Agreements; (2) a modular open systems approach (MOSA), FVL Architecture Collaboration Working Group (with participation from industry and academia) to establish a common architecture requirements framework for FLRAA and FARA system development; and (3) a Competitive Demonstration and Risk Reduction (CD&RR) effort using an Aviation Missile and Technology Consortium (AMTC) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements to provide substantiating technical documentation on weapon system designs, requirements decompositions, trade-studies, and requirements feasibility for the FLRAA PoR.\n\nThese risk reduction activities maintain industry engagement & momentum from the JMR-TD S&T program, inform capabilities and system requirements, and provide initial trade assessments for the final operational requirements. They also inform the final acquisition strategy; mature the Government's architecture requirements development; and transition appropriate S&T data and technologies to the PoR.  The Army plans to initiate the PoR in FY 2022 with a hybrid acquisition approach. This approach includes the opportunity to employ new DODI 5000.80 authorities along with a tailored DODI 5000.02 acquisition strategy. \n\nFinally, the Army is also addressing life cycle affordability, sustainability, and maintainability early in the program. The FLRAA program is employing multiple strategies including:  should cost reduction opportunities; use of a digital thread from design through sustainment; and stochastic sustainment modeling. Additionally, FLRAA is one of the Army's pilot programs for life cycle intellectual property and data strategy development."

The FARA platform will fill the gap in capability for light weight attack\/reconnaissance while significantly increasing speed, range, survivability, and lethality, providing Combatant Commanders with greatly increased tactical, operational and strategic capabilities. \n\nThe FVL Capability Set 1 Initial Capabilities Requirements Document was approved in July 2018 under the name Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). The Acquisition Approach and Determination & Findings for Other Transaction Authority for Prototyping agreements were approved on 1 February 2019 by the Acting Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) to execute a Competitive Prototyping effort."

The aircraft developed under this program will utilize a modular open system approach, which will enable more efficient and cost effective mission equipment integration throughout the lifecycle of the weapon system. \n\nThe Army is executing a FARA Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort from FY 2019-2023 using Other Transaction Authority for Prototyping (OTAP) awards to five industry performers and will be executed utilizing a two-phased approach. The scope of this effort includes prototype design and fabrication process refinement, subsystem and representative system level testing, flight control and mission processor software development and testing, development of systems integration labs, development or modification of test fixtures and facilities, preparation of test plans and reports, the generation of airworthiness documentation, and qualification testing of all processes and subsystems within the prototype aircraft. \n\nPhase one is the initial design phase which was awarded in April 2019 and phase two will begin in March 2020 when two of the five vendors are selected for final detailed design and the development, integration and test of a flyable prototype air vehicle. Phase two will culminate with a government flight test evaluation of the FARA Competitive Prototype no later than the end of FY 2023. \n\nThe Competitive Prototype effort will inform full FARA Weapon System requirements development process, and will develop the data needed to reduce the risks for full weapon system design, integration, testing, and qualification to be completed during the FARA engineering, manufacturing and development phase."

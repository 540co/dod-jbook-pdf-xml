This research will develop the capability to generate a near real-time site model with appropriate engineering details to allow unmanned shaping of the environment through physical interaction (e.g. push, pull, lift, or dig). This effort will also develop the requisite mission planner and task execution controller that accepts input from the user and provides suggestions and feedback based on updates to the site model, reporting from hardware agents, and resource allocation logic. The end state goal is the development of beyond visual line of sight teleoperation and semiautonomous capabilities allowing Engineer robotic support to match pace in near term and future combat environments. This effort will support the development, testing, and evaluation of prototypical robotic Combat Engineer equipment. This Project develops modeling and simulation tools that represent realistic states for Engineer robotic operations and develops and assesses semi-autonomous and autonomous construction equipment technologies needed for remote control Engineer operations.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Portfolio.\n\nWork in this Project is conducted by the United States (US) Army Engineer Research and Development Center and coordinated with US Army Futures Command.\n\nWork in this Project is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and complements PE 063119A (Ground Advanced Technology)."

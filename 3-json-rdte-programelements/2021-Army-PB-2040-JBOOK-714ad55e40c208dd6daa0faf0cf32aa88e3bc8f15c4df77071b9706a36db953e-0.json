            "val": "The Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 budget estimate request funds the development of Aircraft Avionics systems required to horizontally and vertically integrate the battlefield and the integration of those systems into Army aircraft. Tasks in this Program Element support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.\n\nThe Doppler Global Positioning System Navigation Set (DGNS) Upgrade program completes system engineering trade studies to reduce space, weight, and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as an inertial sensor interface card and Instrument Flight Rules map display. The DGNS upgrade includes Non-Recurring Engineering for the Computer Display Unit (CDU) which replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display, provides a moving navigation map capability, and optimizes pilot interface to promote safer flight operations. The CDU upgrade will support Assured-Position Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) operations in conjunction with additional system upgrades and upgrades to existing DGNS hardware in order to accommodate A-PNT in identified operational environments, and incorporates Military-Code (M-Code). This includes anti-jam antenna capabilities and supports the requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations.\n\nThe Enhanced Aviation Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertial (EGI) Navigation System (EAGLE) A-PNT integration program assesses current capabilities in identified operational PNT environment levels, tests identified upgrades to existing EGI hardware in order to accommodate A-PNT in identified operational environments, and incorporates M-Code. It supports the requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations and requires assessment and follow-on upgrade to the EGI navigation system. The EAGLE upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance, associated PNT capability gaps, integrate anti-jam antenna capabilities, and evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.\n\nThe Multi-platform Anti-jam GPS Navigation Antenna (MAGNA) is a GPS anti-jam adaptive antenna system that will be capable of receiving legacy and modernized NAVSTAR GPS satellite signals. The MAGNA reduces the effect of GPS jamming by rejecting the interfering signals before they disrupt the GPS receiver enabling the Warfighter continued access to GPS-provided PNT in a GPS degraded environment.\n\nThe Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) program portfolio includes the DVE Army Directed Requirement (DR) and the Environment Exploitation System (EES).\n\nThe DVE DR is to provide DVE systems to 15 HH-60M Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and 25 Special Operations aircraft. The DVE DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities. The DVE DR system provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions. The program completed development and test efforts in FY 2019.\n\nThe EES program focuses on active and passive sensor technology, synthetic vision, sensor and software data fusion, imagery processing, user interface, and multicore processing technologies to enable current and future capabilities and innovative technical solutions for the Army aviation fleet.\n\nThe Improved Data Modem (IDM) is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation and is fielded on every modernized, rotary-wing Army aircraft, including the CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk. The IDM provides the Army rotary wing fleet with critical communication capabilities, enables connectivity to multiple radios used by rotary-wing aircraft and the Blue Force Tracking transceiver, and provides the means for rapid data transfer. The Aviation Mission Common Server (AMCS) effort is a capability upgrade and replacement for the current Army IDM-401. The AMCS program will implement IDM and Common Operating  Environment capabilities utilizing a flexible open systems architecture and distributed processing resources to perform an array of non-flight critical computing, data processing, radio and communications management, and graphics generation functions for the enduring and future Army Aviation fleet and de-couple non-flight critical mission system technology integration from flight critical components.  The AMCS program will satisfy Army Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) requirements for hardware, software, and firmware and be able to satisfy cybersecurity requirements. The AMCS program will replace the current IDM-401 with a common server capability to support current IDM-401 functionality, provide enhanced data and graphics processing, and provide a FACE architecture through which Aviation platforms will be able to rapidly integrate technology upgrades required to keep pace with evolving threats. The AMCS program will enable the rapid insertion and update of capabilities into Army Aviation operations without requiring lengthy, costly and out of sync software updates to flight mission computers; resulting in affordable, synchronized integration and fielding of Aviation capabilities required for the Multi-Domain Battlefield.  The AMCS program will be the center of the future Common Digital Backbone for the enduring and future Army Aviation fleets, and is the key enabler for Army Aviation Multi-Domain Operations.\n\nThe Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS) is a system used to conduct pre-mission and aircraft performance planning. It recieves data from multiple sources and provides that data digitally to the aircraft to support aviation missions. AMPS is used for automated mission planning, risk assessment, and transfer of mission data to aviation platforms within an Aviation unit. This includes route generation, performance planning, communications planning, terrain analysis, data transfer, and mission rehearsal. These efforts include development and testing of a new underlying architecture to support the move of Army Aviation Mission Planning from the current structure to one that supports synchronization both vertically and horizontally between Aviation and Ground forces. It will allow aircrews to continually plan and update route, threat, and performance data throughout all phases of an Aviation mission. Development of a mobile aircraft performance planning\/weight and balance calculator is currently underway and will be the first migration of AMPS capabilities to a mobile hardware agnostic environment."

Tasks in this Project support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.\n\nThe Improved Data Modem (IDM) is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation and is fielded on every modernized, rotary-wing Army aircraft, including the CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk. The IDM provides the Army rotary wing fleet with critical communication capabilities, enables connectivity to multiple radios used by rotary-wing aircraft and the Blue Force Tracking transceiver, and provides the means for rapid data transfer. The Aviation Mission Common Server (AMCS) effort is a capability upgrade and replacement for the current Army IDM-401. The AMCS program will implement IDM and Common Operating  Environment capabilities utilizing a flexible open systems architecture and distributed processing resources to perform an array of non-flight critical computing, data processing, radio and communications management, and graphics generation functions for the enduring and future Army Aviation fleet and de-couple non-flight critical mission system technology integration from flight critical components.  The AMCS program will satisfy Army Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) requirements for hardware, software, and firmware and be able to satisfy cybersecurity requirements. The AMCS program will replace the current IDM-401 with a common server capability to support current IDM-401 functionality, provide enhanced data and graphics processing, and provide a FACE architecture through which Aviation platforms will be able to rapidly integrate technology upgrades required to keep pace with evolving threats. The AMCS program will enable the rapid insertion and update of capabilities into Army Aviation operations without requiring lengthy, costly and out of sync software updates to flight mission computers; resulting in affordable, synchronized integration and fielding of Aviation capabilities required for the Multi-Domain Battlefield.  The AMCS program will be the center of the future Common Digital Backbone for the enduring and future Army Aviation fleets, and is the key enabler for Army Aviation Multi-Domain Operations.\n\nThe Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS) is a system used to conduct pre-mission and aircraft performance planning. It receives data from multiple sources and provides that data digitally to the aircraft to support aviation missions. AMPS is used for automated mission planning, risk assessment, and transfer of mission data to aviation platforms within an Aviation unit. This includes route generation, performance planning, communications planning, terrain analysis, data transfer, and mission rehearsal. These efforts include development and testing of a new underlying architecture to support the move of Army Aviation Mission Planning from the current structure to one that supports synchronization both vertically and horizontally between Aviation and Ground forces. It will allow aircrews to continually plan and update route, threat, and performance data throughout all phases of an Aviation mission. Development of a mobile aircraft performance planning\/weight and balance calculator is currently underway and will be the first migration of AMPS capabilities to a mobile hardware agnostic environment."

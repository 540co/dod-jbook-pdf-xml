            "val": "The Space Development Agency (SDA) is established to develop the next generation space architecture to enable U.S. military operations to be responsive to emerging multi-domain threats against our national security. To achieve that goal, the SDA will help inform the Department's decision to develop and implement a proliferated architecture enabled by lower cost, commercially-derived spacecraft and routine space access, shift the Department to a development organization focused on experimentation, prototyping, and accelerated fielding, and change the Department to a concentrated, decoupled structure to generate speed. The SDA will manage, direct, and execute the development of the space capabilities in accordance with DoD\u2019s Space Vision and field space capabilities at speed and scale, with the following goals:\n\u2022 bold breakthroughs designed to obsolesce our competitors,\n\u2022 technology maturation and systems engineering,\n\u2022 lean engineering, manufacturing, and support,\n\u2022 industrial base expansion; streamlined development and acquisition process, and\n\u2022 increased acquisition cooperation with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).\n\nThe SDA will rapidly deploy critical elements of the next-generation space capabilities, initially focusing on these essential capabilities:\n\u2022 Persistent global surveillance for advanced missile targeting,\n\u2022 Indications, warnings, targeting, and tracking for defense against advanced missile threats,\n\u2022 Alternate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) for a GPS-denied environment,\n\u2022 Global and near-real time space situational awareness,\n\u2022 Development of a deterrent capability,\n\u2022 Responsive, resilient, common ground-based space support infrastructure (e.g., ground stations and launch capability),\n\u2022 Cross-domain, networked, node-independent battle management command, control, and communications (BMC3), including nuclear command, control, and\ncommunications (NC3), and, \n\u2022 Highly-scaled, low-latency, persistent, artificial intelligence-enable global surveillance.\n\nThe establishment of a communications and data transport layer in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is essential to developing a new, responsive space architecture, and will be SDA\u2019s primary initial focus. The SDA will heavily leverage DARPA\u2019s Blackjack program (PE 0603287E) and its plan to demonstrate a 20-satellite constellation to build this transport layer. The SDA will develop an initial wedge of sub-constellations on this transport layer to provide additional capabilities, such as advanced missile warning.\n\nThis program element funds efforts to develop and demonstrate a prototype proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) communications and data transport layer and its sub-constellations in support of the DoD Space Vision."

The DITMAC and the systems that support it (DITMAC System of Systems (DSoS)) were scoped to enable processing of reports to DITMAC only. The commencement of operations of some DoD Component Insider Threat Programs in FY16 uncovered a lack of available technical capabilities.  A determination was made to offer the DSoS as the DoDs enterprise platform for insider threat related technical capabilities. The platform expansion requires a complete system re-architecture design to make the technical capabilities more readily accessible by related missions, increasing communication\/information sharing, decreasing cyber vulnerabilities, and cost savings each year in software licensing and technical support."

Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC and BTB-ECBC in compliance with Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY03 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002).\n\nWDTC and BTB-ECBC are the reliance centers for all DoD CB defense testing and provide the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) test facility.  Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the OSD Chemical and Biological Defense Program IAW Program Budget Decision 250 (1996).\n\nWDTC and BTB-ECBC use state-of-the-art chemical and life-sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, equipment, and non-materiel CB defense solutions while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides test ranges, to include fully instrumented outdoor ranges, for TTPD activities and testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data are generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.\n\nThe Secretary of the Army has been directed to conduct additional research addressing existing gaps in scientific knowledge encompassing the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Program.  The transition of the Bio-Testing Branch (BTB) to ECBC will enable the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program to meet end to end enterprise tracking, reporting, and auditability requirements within an approved Governance, Risks, and Compliance framework.  The laboratory commanders and directors are best able to identify potential risk through the use of local risk assessments and are responsible to promote cultures of safety and responsibility.  Direct liaison with and oversight by the Executive Agent Responsible Officer will ensure laboratory directors or the MRTFB commander are empowered and supported in their operational environment.  The ultimate responsibility for the safe and secure receipt, storage, handling, shipment and transfer of BSAT resides with the laboratory director or the MRTFB commander in accordance with Army, Navy, Air Force, and Federal policies and regulations.  The implementation of a structured BSAT Biosafety Program includes clear standards and procedures, policy and regulations, peer review, quality control, accountability and oversight, adequate resources and infrastructure, and continuous process improvement.  Through these means employees and members of the public are protected against the hazards associated with BSAT."

Key systems include: gas filters, mechanical\/electrical, fume hoods, duct work and structural systems.  Provides for the initial equipment outfitting of new facilities.  Ensures that the necessary surety operations can be conducted effectively and safely in support of Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) RDT&E programs.  As a force multiplier, this project will provide more robust capabilities to the CBDP and ensure continuity of operations and environmental compliance."

Funds execution management is provided by Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). \n\nThe project also provides for the development, coordination and integration of Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defense capability requirements, including assistance and support to the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Services to improve CBRN defense related doctrine, education, training, and awareness by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO); preparation of Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) documents in accordance with Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction CJCSI 3170.01I dated 23 January 2015; Joint CBRN Defense Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) planning; input to the CBD Annual Report to Congress; and program guidance development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO).\n\nThe Biological Select Agent and Toxin (BSAT) Biosafety Program Office (BBPO) will advise the Executive Agent Responsible Official (EA RO) for the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program on biosafety and all matters that pertain to risk associated with BSAT operations, provide oversight of DoD BSAT laboratory biosafety operations, serve as a unified DoD interface with external regulatory agencies, ensure safety and standardization of procedures used in DoD BSAT laboratories, and identify industry-wide best practices to enhance biosafety across the full spectrum of DoD BSAT operations.  As the EA RO for BSAT the program is tasked with technical review, inspection, and harmonization of biosafety protocols and procedures across DoD laboratories that handle BSAT.  As such, the program manages the Biosafety and Scientific Review Panel, inspection of DoD laboratories, harmonization of DoD BSAT-related regulations and procedures, coordinating interaction and information with the CDC, establishing a Defense Business System to track and manage BSAT across DoD, providing laboratory biosafety oversight, and advancing BSAT-related scientific research to address knowledge gaps.  A portion of the funding line transitions to BSAT Research Support starting in FY20 to support the Scientific Gaps in Biorisk Research Program (SGBRP) to address gaps in scientific knowledge pertaining to biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) biosafety and biosecurity.  Closing these gaps will reduce the inherent risks associated with BSAT research in CBDP laboratories and supports research and development work on priority agents.\n\nThe project includes programming support for the Joint Service CB Information System (JSCBIS) which serves as a budgetary and informational database for the DoD CBDP.  Also included within the project is financial management services to include fund distribution, execution reporting, and fiscal financial statements.\n\nThis project also supports the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) Test and Evaluation (T&E) Executive, who is responsible for the planning, balancing, and oversight of test infrastructure and test technology requirements to support Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of DoD CBRND systems, as outlined in the RDA Plan.  The CBRND T&E Executive oversees the Enterprise processes to develop and sustain standardized T&E methodologies and validated instrumentation and infrastructure to ensure the adequacy of test for CBRND systems in alignment with acquisition milestones and associated decision points.  The Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program supports T&E Early Involvement; test threat planning; T&E studies; and T&E standards planning and development to support CBRND testing for all Services to include medical T&E efforts.  \n\nThe CBRND T&E Executive directly supports OSD T&E oversight of acquisition programs and provides the mechanism for early T&E involvement in the acquisition process.  The CBRND T&E Executive provides the T&E infrastructure investment strategy and coordinates investment planning and T&E capabilities validation among the Joint Service Community to ensure that program needs are met.  The CBRND T&E Executive oversees the T&E processes to ensure end to end feedback loops to support to the Warfighter."

Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  \n  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\n  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\n  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

                                                "val": "The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation, and modeling and simulation capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost-glide weapons. Progress was made toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine\u2019s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to \u201cfly the mission\u201d and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope. Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number (M4.5-7.5) aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The HAPCAT project continued to develop and demonstrate air delivery system technologies to provide uniform flow with variable pressure and temperature through a nozzle up to Mach 7.5 conditions.  The project activities included initiation of Phase 2 beginning fabrication of the air delivery system and conceptual design of a full scale facility. \n  Efforts continued on the morphing ceramic components for hypersonic ground test facilities project which seeks to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  Testing to validate direct-connect hardware designs were completed at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). This technology promises to provide a significant advantage over current rigid, stationary facility hardware by providing a \u201cfirst-ever\u201d realistic variable Mach flight distortion simulation test capability, while reducing costs and increasing productivity.\n  The large-scale scramjet engine test techniques project accomplishments included continued progress in determining the capability of existing ground test facilities and methodologies to evaluate and develop large-scale hypersonic propulsion systems.  Testing of the semi-freejet test configuration utilizing an advanced hydrocarbon fueled missile scale scramjet completed. Analysis comparing tests between the larger and smaller facilities allowed the optimized utilization of existing facilities and defined the size and type of investments needed for future large-scale scramjet vehicle development and reduction of flight test and acquisition risks.\n  Construction of the Large Energy National Shock Tunnel II extension was completed and evaluated to verify extended run times. Such testing will enable the full development of complex flow features affecting vehicle performance, the determination of control surface responsiveness and effectiveness, and the evaluation of the performance of aerodynamic features. The improvements will help fill a critical test capability gap and support future hypersonic vehicle programs. Initial facility performance assessments of the extended tunnel demonstrated a 3 fold increase in test run time. \n  The HSST project continued development of a mid-pressure arc heater prototype.  The prototype replaced an existing Huels arc heater with a segmented heater, creating a test envelope approximately three times larger than the current envelope for aerothermal testing.  The prototype will provide extended test run time of up to 30 minutes and a higher thermal load representative of that experienced by a hypersonic vehicle TPS. These efforts advanced progress toward the goal of improved T&E of maneuvering reentry and boost\/glide vehicles. In a related effort, the arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development made significant progress toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  \n  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance. Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle. Experimental results acquired through the boundary layer transition effort will be used to validate state of the art prediction tools and measurements of boundary layer transition mechanisms. The project conducted testing in multiple tunnels providing a basis for comparative analysis in different test configurations and comprehensive code validation test cases regarding 3D boundary layer stability and transition.  \n  Progress continued toward the development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed\/direction, oxygen\/water content) along a hypersonic vehicle\u2019s flight path.  This technology is a significant advancement over current methods, which employ balloons carrying sensors to sample the atmosphere.  The LIDAR will improve the accuracy of high altitude atmospheric conditions. This atmospheric data is needed to assess the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development. Testing and demonstration of LIDAR atmospheric sensing was completed and the portable system was transitioned to support test programs at coastal flight test ranges to demonstrate system performance in a maritime environment. Development of an airborne version of the LIDAR began with the initial design and testing of hardware components. \n  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  Preliminary design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft. \n  An Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) based range support study was completed to determine the technical performance and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for a High Altitude, Long Endurance Uncrewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) configured to support flight T&E of hypersonic vehicles.  Telemetry, optical remote sensing, and LIDAR atmospheric measurements instrumentation capabilities were analyzed to estimate the technical performance of each on an airborne platform. The design, fabrication, and installation of a telemetry capability integrated on to a HALE UAS airborne platform for a technical demonstration was initiated.\n  Measurements of thermal emissions from the surface of typical boost-glide vehicles in an impulse test facility were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different surface compositions and treatments and filter frequencies for thermal imaging. \n  Advances were achieved in the development of M&S tools. Verification and improvement of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes continued, making use of the unique data sets obtained from the HSST scramjet engines tests and boundary layer experiments.  A validated boundary layer transition prediction tool was released for application to complex, 3D boost-glide vehicle geometries. The code enables prediction and analysis of the characteristics and extent of boundary layer transition on the test article surface resulting from variations in nose bluntness, unit Reynolds number, and angle of attack. \n  The transient thermal analysis software effort completed integration of an aerothermal code and a structural heating code.  The code underwent beta testing by multiple organizations and was released to the hypersonic community to support planning and analysis of flight tests."

The air streams are regulated through the air delivery system to produce a specified flight enthalpy (energy) level appropriate for the clean air flight condition being simulated in the test. \n  Upgrades to the Large Energy National Shock Tunnel to increase productivity and accuracy during operation will be initiated. \n  The upgrades to the mid-pressure arc heater will be completed to include the operation of a validated segmented arc heater system. Completion of boundary layer transition efforts will establish a new baseline protocol and recommendations for hypersonic aero performance predictions.\n  Efforts will continue to assess the technical performance and CONOPS for a HALE UAS configured to support flight T&E of hypersonic vehicles. A telemetry system onboard a UAS capable of collecting data from a hypersonic flight vehicle over broad open ocean areas will be demonstrated."

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.\n  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD\u2019s strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.\n  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

The networked data recorder addresses CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  \n  A non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne applications was demonstrated showing 10 gigabit Ethernet data speeds required to support CTEIP data transmission requirements. Once ruggedized, this technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard test data transmitter. SET matured technology to enable more efficient handling of multiple priority test data and communications between the network router and telemetry transceiver.  Development continued on a multi-band transceiver operating in the L\/S\/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms.  This technology determines the performance of the telemetry link and selects the optimal modulation scheme based on current link conditions, accounting for issues such as multipath.  Technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network was further matured.  This technology enables more efficient use of the RF spectrum by reducing the amount of data transmitted by only transmitting data parameters when changes occur. Technology enabling the compression of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) data was further matured. \n  The SET project developed technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of large footprint, long range missiles and hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna suitable for mounting on a Global Hawk platform was developed and its antenna gain performance characterized in a high fidelity laboratory environment.  A modular digital beam-forming solution to control a phased array antenna and track multiple targets simultaneously was developed.  These technologies will significantly reduce the system complexity for an airborne phased array antenna, providing savings in terms of size, weight, and power consumption.  \n  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a software-based technology solution to accurately characterize RF spectrum utilization on DoD test ranges. This technology will develop the interfaces to existing range RF spectrum scheduling and resource management tools and also implement a standard set of spectrum usage metrics to quantify RF spectrum usage based on times of day and test programs. This tool will transition initially to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB to support RF spectrum management activities, aid in the identification of future spectrum requirements, and quantify the impact of inadequate access to spectrum, in terms of program cost and schedule."

Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.\n  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.\n  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.\n  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.  \n  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system\u2019s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders."

A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects. The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats."

DET transitioned a compact hard tube vircator (CHTV) to the Air Force.

They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology developments within the UAST portfolio have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess an autonomous system\u2019s ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.\n  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating, system-of-autonomous-systems that will work in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems."

The UAST collaborates with the Autonomy Community of Interest (COI) Test and Evaluation, Verification and Validation (TEVV) Working Group to help ensure that UAST is investing in technologies relevant to the future of autonomous systems.\n  The UAST project explored technologies required for T&E of emerging UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces. UAST continued research on autonomous system test planning to develop technologies which develop the most pertinent test plans for maritime, air, and ground-based autonomous systems and enable testers to identify the degree of regression testing required for autonomous systems upon changes to the hardware and software.  The UAST project emphasized autonomy test technologies that can be integrated for use in a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) environment within the MRTFB.  UAST invested in robustness testing technology to detect and predict vulnerabilities and failures within UAS software.

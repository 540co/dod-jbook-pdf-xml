USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.\n\nThe USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA\/NA-22 supplies USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and Systems Engineering, Integration and Test\n(SEI&T) activities on Space Vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).\n\nDoD funds their contribution to the USNDS program in Program Element (PE) 1203913F with Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF), and Operations and Maintenance (O&M).\n\nUSNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified\nGEO host), and Space Test Platform (STP) 3. Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment, the RADEC Data Processor (RDP), and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the five deployable mobile ground segment survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and the survivable\/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental, evolutionary acquisition approach.\n\nThe upgrade to the GNT is the survivable\/endurable UGNT which is funded with RDT&E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable\/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar\/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The GNT supports ITW\/AA and NFM missions. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System Survivable (SBIRS) \/ Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW\/AA and NFM. The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the Mobile Ground System (MGS) mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced NUDET detection capabilities which meet survivable\/ endurable attack assessment requirements directed by the President, Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.\n\nThis budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas. Sensor integration for GPS III and GPS IIIF are funded in their respective PEs.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NUDET Detection System (SPACE) weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds is in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

USNDS 7 ICADS reports endoatmospheric, transition and near-space nuclear detonations as detected by the USNDS sensors aboard the GPS satellites, DSP satellites and SABRS equipped satellites. ICADS Build 7 process NDS, State-of-Health (SOH), and navigation data from GPS IIIF. USNDS 7 UGNT provide NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable\/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar\/AEHF circuits. USNDS 7 also consists of the Integrated Data Denial (IDD). IDD is a Communications Security (COMSEC) device associated with the USNDS. IDD provides decryption of satellite position data and NDS sensor data used to detect, locate, and report nuclear detonations in earth's atmosphere or near-space in near real time. This IDD effort contains cryptographic modifications mandated by National Security Agency (NSA). In addition, parts obsolescence requires the start of a new IDD design and manufacturing effort."

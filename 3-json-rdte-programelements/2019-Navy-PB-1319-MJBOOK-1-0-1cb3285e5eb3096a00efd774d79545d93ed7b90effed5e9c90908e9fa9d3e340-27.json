            "val": "Proj 0363- Most Navy munitions react violently when exposed to unplanned stimuli such as fire, shock and bullet or fragment impact, thus presenting a great hazard to ships, aircraft, and personnel.  The Insensitive Munitions Advanced Development (IMAD) program will provide, validate, and transition technology to all new weapon developments and priority weapon systems and enable production of munitions insensitive to these stimuli with no reduction in combat performance.  Insensitive Munitions (IM) is the Navy's focused effort on propellants, propulsion units, explosives, warheads, fuses, and pyrotechnics to reduce the severity of cook-off and bullet\/fragment impact reactions, minimizing the probability for sympathetic detonation, both in normal storage and in use, increasing ship and platform survivability and satisfying performance and readiness requirements.\n\nProj 3436- The AN\/BST-1 Submarine Emergency Communication Transmitter informs Navy leadership when a ballistic missile submarine is in extremis. When activated, a buoy is released from the submarine, floats to the surface and transmits an emergency signal.  The energetic components in the system release the buoy from the submarine, separate protective covers and actuate an antenna for communication.  The AN\/BST-1 Buoy energetic component re-design will replace two antenna related explosive components that utilize explosive formulations that are no longer produced due to environmental impact.  The re-design will support future procurements for OHIO and COLUMBIA class deployments.  The energetic component re-design includes design, prototyping, design verification testing, environmental qualification, hazard classification, insensitive munitions and developmental testing. The two re-designed energetic components will be qualified for USN use at the conclusion of the program."

When activated, a buoy is released from the submarine, floats to the surface and transmits an emergency signal.  The energetic components in the system release the buoy from the submarine, separate protective covers and actuate an antenna for communication.  The AN\/BST-1 Buoy energetic component re-design will replace two antenna related explosive components that utilize explosive formulations that are no longer produced due to environmental impact.  The re-design will support future procurements for OHIO and COLUMBIA class deployments.  The energetic component re-design includes design, prototyping, design verification testing, environmental qualification, hazard classification, insensitive munitions and developmental testing. The two re-designed energetic components will be qualified for Navy use at the conclusion of the program."

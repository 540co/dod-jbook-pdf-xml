FUAS encompasses an array of capabilities from platoon soldiers to Division Commanders.\n\nFuture Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) is a new start program. To fully enable these desired cross-domain capabilities, FTUAS will leverage universal and scalable control interfaces and plug-and-play, advanced payloads to optimize manned-unmanned teaming for air and ground maneuver units across all environments. These systems will employ multi-domain capabilities increasing the Army's ability to generate overmatch, provide the ground commander with multiple options, and enable joint force freedom of maneuver. Key attributes of the FTUAS include: (1) Reach: Expeditionary maneuver and mobility through increased speed, range, endurance, and payload capacity; (2) Protection: The capability and capacity to operate across a wider depth and breadth of domains, including high threat and denied environments, with assured communications, navigation, and reduced visual, electronic, and audio signatures able to overcome enemy countermeasures in high threat, anti-access and area denial (A2AD) environments; and (3) Lethality: A broad range of sensors and cross-domain fires that increase the speed of detecting, acquiring, identifying, and prioritizing targets to suppress, neutralize, and destroy enemy forces.\n\nFTUAS will consist of an aircraft subsystem that will include the airframe, propulsion, avionics, communications, navigation, and software systems; aircraft-specific ground support equipment including take-off and landing systems, power generation, transportation, or unique command and control equipment; aircraft software; and required engineering, logistics, and programmatic support.\n\nThe Material Development Decision (MDD) for FTUAS is planned for FY21 followed by a 12 month Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). At the end of the AoA phase TRAC Leavenworth will present findings and conclusions based on the collected and analyzed data. FTUAS will be prepared to proceed to the appropriate acquisition milestone based on Army's decision."

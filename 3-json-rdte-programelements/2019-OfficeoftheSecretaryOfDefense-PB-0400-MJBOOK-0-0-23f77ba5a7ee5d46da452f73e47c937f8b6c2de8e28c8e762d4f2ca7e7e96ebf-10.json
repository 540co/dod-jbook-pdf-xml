CTTS is expanding its partnerships with other Defense rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users. \nCTTS major area of emphasis during FY18 and FY19 will be projects to Counter-ISIL.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat\/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.\nSpecific CTTS areas of emphasis in FY18 and FY19 include Counter-tunnel, Countering-sUAVs, improving digital operations at the tactical level, increasing lethality of small weapons and ammunition, and addressing threats to commercial aviation.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. \nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products."

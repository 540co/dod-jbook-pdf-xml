JSTARS Recap will provide airborne, stand-off range, surveillance and target acquisition radar and Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) capabilities. JSTARS Recap will provide theater, ground and air commanders with ground surveillance to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption, and destruction of enemy forces. \n\nFY18 to FY23 RDT&E BA required to execute the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase of this acquisition. The focus of EMD will be to procure three Commercial Derivative Aircraft (CDA) and integrate the various subsystems (i.e. BMC2, Communications, Radar and ground support systems) to verify that system performance meets required capabilities. The primary evaluation of the weapon system development will occur during the EMD phase. Additionally, there will be major Technical Reviews accomplished during this  phase: Combined System Requirements Review\/System Functional Review (SRFR); Preliminary Design Review (PDR); Critical Design Review (CDR); Test Readiness Reviews (TRR); Production Readiness Review (PRR), Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) and Physical Configuration Audit (PCA).\n\nFunding may also support studies, analyses, and risk reduction activities addressing all subsystems to support both current program planning\/execution and future Air Force program planning.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JSTARS Recap weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is projected to receive Milestone B approval and is conducting EMD tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to Full Rate Production (FRP)."

The Program achieved Milestone (MS) A approval on 10 December 2015, received Request for Proposal (RFP) release decision review Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 7 September 2016, and commenced source selection on 2 March 2017. The MS B decision review is currently scheduled for 2QFY18, with a contract award anticipated 3-4QFY18. JSTARS Recap is comprised of a business-class CDA with integrated BMC2, radar and communication subsystems, as well as ground support systems (trainers, simulators, mission planning, etc). The Program will leverage available systems and mature technologies using Open Systems Architecture (OSA) to minimize risks during the EMD phase while lowering life cycle costs.  The Program developed a Government Reference Architecture (GRA) to define functional capabilities of the JSTARS Recap Weapon System (WS). The GRA enabled subsystem technical analysis and risk reduction to validate technical maturity. The GRA also supports the Program's strategy to OTB, aimed to reduce cost throughout the system's life cycle, foster competition during the Operations and Support (O&S) acquisition phase, and allow flexibility to readily incorporate new technologies and capabilities.\n\nPrior to MS A, the Program executed three (3) contracts to conduct system-level System Requirements Reviews (SRR) (collectively, the \"Pre-EMD Contracts\u201d). The Pre-EMD Contracts focused on requirements analysis, assessing the WS design, design maturity, and risk reduction. Upon receiving MS A approval, the Program exercised the TMRR options for system-level design reviews and subsystems prototype demonstrations. In parallel with the Pre-EMD Contracts, the Program also executed contracts with the two (2) viable radar Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) focused on advancing radar design, assessing manufacturing readiness, and mitigating both technical and schedule risk during the EMD Phase. The Program commenced source selection on 2 March 2017. This was separate, full and open competition for the EMD phase of the Program. Contract Award is expected between 2-4QFY18 and will include the EMD effort as well as options for Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and FRP Lots #1-3.\n\nThe Program will develop a total of seventeen (17) JSTARS Recap WS. The first three (3) WS produced during EMD will be instrumented to support Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E). After DT&E, two (2) of these instrumented WS will be reconfigured to production representative WS in support of Initial Operational Capability (IOC); the one (1) remaining WS will maintain instrumentation for testing purposes. Two (2) LRIP WS will be developed to meet the four (4) WS required for IOC. FRP will consist of three (3) production lots to procure an additional twelve (12) WS to support Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2QFY28."

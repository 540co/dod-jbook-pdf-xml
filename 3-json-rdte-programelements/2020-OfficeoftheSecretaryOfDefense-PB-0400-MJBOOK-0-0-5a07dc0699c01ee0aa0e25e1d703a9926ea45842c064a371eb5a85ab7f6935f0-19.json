            "val": "The United States has enjoyed a historical technological advantage in sensors, weapons, and countermeasures.  To offset this advantage, adversaries are developing competing and asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices.  These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, small unmanned air systems, and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems such as advanced sensors and communications systems, advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) components and systems, integrated air defense systems (IADS), and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles. \n\nThe rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and demands a faster response than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) research, development, and acquisition processes can provide.  The myriad of new advanced electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats have made operations in the EMS significantly more difficult and complex.  The challenges posed by new kinetic and nonkinetic EMS threats and the dire consequences of technology surprise highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can address new threats far more quickly and in more cost-effective ways.\n\nThe Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program is specifically designed to address these challenges through efforts designed to substantially accelerate new nonkinetic solutions for the EMS battlespace.  To do this, the JEAT program explores technologies and approaches that either fall outside the Services\u2019 research and development (R&D) programs of record or are being developed at rates that cannot deliver needed capabilities in the required timeframes. \n\nTo identify nearer-term and lower-cost solutions, JEAT specifically explores and assesses approaches that use off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways.  This approach has resulted in substantial savings for the Services and the Department in both R&D and in Programs of Record.  It has also enabled needed military capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible by traditional DoD approaches. \n\nJEAT program efforts are focused in four areas in two project codes, Project 619 and Project 245.\n\nThere currently are three classes of efforts within Project 619, EW and Non-Kinetic Effects Experimentation and Oversight:\n\n(1) Experimentation\/Demonstration efforts utilize innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to fully understand current and future threats and more rapidly and thoroughly explore, mature, and demonstrate potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities. This effort will be realigned and funded out of the 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element beginning in FY 2020. \n\n(2) Advanced Technology Development\/Verification efforts investigate mature technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways and provide powerful new warfighting capabilities.  These efforts include advanced technology development of new sensors and countermeasures in laboratory environments and the development and demonstration of new warfighting capabilities such as computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies and approaches to enhance EMS situational awareness and accelerate nonkinetic operations planning and decision-making. This effort will be realigned to Project 245 beginning in FY 2020.\n\n(3) EW Collaboration and Planning ensures appropriate coordination and technological oversight of Department and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&D programs and processes and provides governance insights for senior decision-makers. This effort will be realigned to Project 245 beginning in FY 2020.\n\nCurrently the sole effort in Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation explores computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies, tools, and approaches to enhance EMS situational awareness and accelerate nonkinetic operations planning and decision-making."

Three efforts, Experimentation\/Demonstration (Expt\/Demo), Advanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V), and Electronic Warfare Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P), focus on enabling nearer-term lower-cost technology transitions to the warfighter with reduced risk. \n\nExpt\/Demo efforts use innovative large-scale field experimentation venues to explore, demonstrate, mature, and assess innovative technologies and approaches to counter advanced electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for U.S. forces.  ATD\/V efforts mature, integrate, and demonstrate technologies and approaches not being explored by the Services, including the use of off-the-shelf commercial and military technologies.  They include laboratory efforts to demonstrate nearer-term, lower cost technological solutions to emergent threats.  EW C&P efforts are conducted within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)).  These efforts assess, ensure coordination, and provide insights to senior leadership on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber research and development (R&D). \n\nExpt\/Demo venues simultaneously explore myriads of technologies and approaches side-by-side with warfighter participation to more rapidly identify and mature promising technological solutions.  They employ very complex and dense EMS environments, fielded and in-development threats, and emerging technologies and capabilities in combinations and ways not otherwise achievable due to cost and other limitations.  These venues thus provide greater realism and far more information than any other developmental approach. \n\nThe next Expt\/Demo venue, Silent Hammer (SH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive series of events to explore, assess, mature, and accelerate technologies and approaches for multi-platform, multi-aperture, multi-domain (M3) passive\/active sensing and targeting in complex and congested EMS environments.  Modeled after JEAT\u2019s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE), and VIGILANT HAMMER venues, SH will use both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants opportunities to explore new M3 capabilities and approaches to engage emerging EMS threats.  Follow-on venues will address similar compelling capabilities, approaches, and threats. This effort will be realigned and funded out of the 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element beginning in FY 2020.\n\nATD\/V explores, matures, integrates, and demonstrates emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs.  Many of these efforts are conducted in JEAT\u2019s state-of-the-art Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory to enable exploration of exceptionally complex approaches and interactions including, for example, multi-aperture collaborative-coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment using exquisitely coordinated electronic sensing and attack capabilities. \n\nEW C&P supports activities related to selecting, organizing, overseeing, and coordinating all EW and EW-Cyber-related R&D efforts across DoD.  EW C&P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Services, and the Intelligence Community (IC) on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD.  To accomplish this, EW C&P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW- and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensors, seekers, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures, and EMS battle management.  EW C&P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)) on Programs of Record, Joint Urgent Operational Need responses, and similar efforts, including technology maturity and availability, critical program information standards, foreign disclosure, and technical signals requirements.  EW C&P also conducts and leads deep dives and analyses of technological opportunities and advanced threats to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&D research, development and acquisition efforts."

Emerging concepts and technologies from the R&E Reliance Process and the EW Science and Technology Community of Interest road maps were assessed for their potential impact and value.  Analysis and coordination of national and international efforts addressing emerging Information Operations and EW-Cyber Convergence topics were addressed as well as efforts to advance technologies that provide countermeasures to imaging infrared seekers and expand U.S.-Australia collaboration in EW-Cyber.

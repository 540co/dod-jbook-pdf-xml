            "val": "The JAIC was established to preserve and expand our military advantage in support of the Department\u2019s 2018 National Defense Strategy. As a primarily executing body it will accelerate the delivery of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled capabilities, scale the Department-wide impact of AI, and synchronize DoD AI activities to expand Joint Force advantages.  The JAIC mission is to accelerate the delivery of AI to achieve impact scaled across the DoD at relevant speed to transform the DoD and ensure the nation maintains a competitive advantage.  JAIC capitalizes on Project Maven\u2019s efforts as the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD to further critical AI architecture and prototyping to rapidly expand AI to other mission areas. As JAIC efforts prove relevant, they will expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use, and increase Joint Force capability.  Most military data storage, utilization, and analytic tools and systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. JAIC capabilities are commercial technology initiatives that insert commercial AI into existing programs of record. \n\nJAIC will execute an initial sequence of cross-functional use cases to demonstrate value and create momentum, called National Mission Initiatives (NMI). NMIs will rapidly develop and deploy AI across the Joint Force for selected high-priority, pressing operational or business reform challenges. Additionally, JAIC will work closely with individual components to help identify, shape, and accelerate component-specific AI deployments, called Component Mission Initiatives (CMI). Both NMI and CMI efforts will include selecting commercial and academic partners for prototypes, and develop standardized processes with respect to data, testing and evaluation, and cybersecurity. JAIC will use lessons learned from these initial projects to establish new processes and standards that will be repeatable across additional projects and immediately relevant to the Joint Force. This will be done in collaboration with partners across technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), services, and international partners.\n\nTo support the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the JAIC will catalyze and develop AI capabilities to enhance readiness and lethality and ensure DoD maintains an advantage over adversaries.  JAIC will spearhead this unique opportunity to expand the competitive space across all domains with AI. JAIC efforts will directly contribute to increased military readiness towards a more lethal Joint Force, it will strengthen alliances and attract new partners by focusing on global problems, and it will enable Departmental reform to increase performance and affordability.  JAIC will cultivate workforce talent by recruiting, developing, and retaining high-quality personnel to enable the development and delivery of AI.  This will bring critical skills into the department by drawing outside expertise, and leveraging small companies, start-ups, and universities.  Implementing AI at a speed of relevance hinges on the ability to integrate AI better than our adversaries, and the JAIC will enable the Department to adapt AI into how it fights. JAIC will focus on speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent capability delivery sprints. To fully realize this potential, the JAIC will pioneer AI approaches across the full scale of the global enterprise in a manner that is jointly interoperable with allies, partners, military Services, and agencies. Specifically, JAIC will identify and implement new organizational approaches, establish key AI building blocks and standards, develop and attract AI talent, and introduce new operational models that will enable DoD to systematically take advantage of AI at enterprise scale. The JAIC will fulfill the National Security Strategy and NDS to ensure conventional overmatch through dual-use commercial technology and partnered DoD-developed AI. The JAIC will collaborate with non-governmental organizations, corporations, strategic influencers, and partners and allies. JAIC will seize the initiative to lead the world in the development and adoption of transformative defense AI solutions that are safe, ethical, and secure. JAIC will spearhead this effort, engaging with the best minds in government, the private sector, academia, and international community."

The new NMI will provide artificial intelligence to the Cyber Mission Force to enable enterprise-scale sensemaking for cyberspace operations. Advanced adversarial Cyber actors infiltrate and operate undetected within the DoD Information Network (DODIN). Operating numerous disparate tools and processing the avalanche of data exceeds human cognitive ability for warfighters to detect and understand adversary activity. This hinders military operations, diminishes the security posture of the DODIN, and potentially compromises national strategic assets.  Cyberspace operators and security professionals rely on static signature and rule based techniques combined with manual data correlation processes to detect known threats in the DODIN. They leverage disparate commercial and open source software to enumerate friendly Cyber terrain resulting in a myopic view of the Cyber environment. Due to the dynamic, contested, and congested nature of the DODIN, these capabilities fail to adequately integrate information to provide a Cyberspace Common Operating Picture. Currently, the Cyber Mission Force requires significant man-hours to manage, with varying degrees of success: detect advanced cyber threats in real time, identify adversarial use of compromised accounts, identify novel threat activity, and categorize user behavior trends and anomalies to detect adversary use of compromised accounts. Additionally, overall NMI efforts will augment current network mapping tools to accelerate and enrich Cyber terrain enumeration and improve situational awareness. Finally, this NMI will increase automation in malware and event detection\/response to improve human sensing and optimize decision making to apply human judgement where it is most needed and apply machines to do repetitive analysis.\n\nRapid prototyping models will be developed to detect adversary use of compromised accounts; to understand the DODIN networks and system malware\/event detections; and to enhance network mapping. These actions will decrease the time and human effort it currently takes to conduct such cyber efforts, while increasing the accuracy and effectiveness of such efforts at the speed of machine computing. It will return the cognitive bandwidth of cyber defense operators and allow them to better maintain awareness of, and exercise judgement in the cyber realm. This NMI will increase DODIN security, safeguard sensitive information, and give crucial time back to decision makers who can focus on strategic analysis and response, rather than making sense of adversaries\u2019 actions and deterring them."

This includes the ability to process more, or higher levels of relevant knowledge and apply human cognitive capital to higher order judgments on a faster pace than previously capable.\n\u2022 Money \u2013 Enable the warfighter to reduce duplication of effort and to prepare and execute events at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow. This includes finding efficiencies in system lifecycle management, supply chain, replacement and repair, and more accurate requisitions, saving critical limited fiscal resources to be applied appropriately.\n\u2022 Realism \u2013 Enable the warfighter to create an environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow.\n\u2022 Fidelity \u2013 Ensure unity of effort throughout the Department and external stakeholders for national imperative focus areas, while catalyzing and accelerating AI capabilities beyond what was previously projected to be accomplished during that time period.\n\u2022 Transition \u2013 Select projects that have the greatest likelihood of adoption and transition to operational capabilities."

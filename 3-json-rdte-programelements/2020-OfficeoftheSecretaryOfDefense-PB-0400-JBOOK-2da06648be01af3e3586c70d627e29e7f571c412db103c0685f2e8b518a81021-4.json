            "val": "The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research project 534 is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The LL project supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components, and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds ten technology areas.  Note: In FY 2019, the Cyber efforts moved to an individual project code 815.\n\nOf the technology areas, there are five core-technology areas:  Advanced Devices; Optical Systems and Technology; Information, Computation and Exploitation; Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology; and Cyber Security, Science and Engineering.  There are four emerging-technology initiatives:  Advanced Materials and Processes; Quantum System Sciences; Biomedical Sciences and Technology; and Autonomous Systems.  There is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. \n\nThese ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence, project 535.  The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today\u2019s global S&T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW\/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow\u2019s future. The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Cyber Security, Science and Engineering under project code 815 starting in FY 2019.  The Cyber Security, Science and Engineering research project 815 supports innovative research that addresses critical national security problems in cyber. The project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, and algorithms in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD."

Development of a small laser radar in FY 2018 will allow real-time 3D images on a small unmanned air vehicle. Microwave radars with multiple receivers have many advantages including multiple look angles, stealthy receivers, and higher resolution. Research with simultaneous microwave beams and optical beacons will explore techniques to overcome synchronization and coherent combining difficulties. The ability for wavelength agility will become as important in the optical domain as it is for microwave electronic warfare. So, development of multi-wavelength imaging spectrometers, long-wavelength infrared laser radars, and wavelength-agile short pulse lasers will provide continued capability growth while ensuring that deployed countermeasures in overused optical regions will not thwart DoD capabilities."

Leveraging technology watch and horizon scanning (TW\/HS) tools, and scouting areas of global technology development, the program\u2019s end-state is to inform senior leadership on where best to invest resources in technology areas to maintain or regain global competitive advantage. The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.

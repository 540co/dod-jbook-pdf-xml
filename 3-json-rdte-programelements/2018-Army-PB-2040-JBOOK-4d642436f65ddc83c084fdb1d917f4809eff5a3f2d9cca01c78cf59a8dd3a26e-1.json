The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness.\n\nThis Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in Program Element (PE) 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology). The networked sensing and data fusion efforts performed in this Project complement efforts funded in PE 0601104A \/ Project H50 (Network Sciences CTA) and PE 0601104A \/ Project J22 (Network Science and Technology Research Center CTA).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas.\n\nWork in this area is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

In particular, this effort will analyze current and emerging RF spoofing, RF jamming, and RF signature management technologies to determine their impact on the performance of air defense radars. Electromagnetic modeling, RF measurements, and experiments will be used to identify mitigation techniques for spoofing and jamming, and to identify useful signature management technologies. This will also include research in electronic devices, sub-assembly design, and laboratory experiments to advance the state-of-the-art of air defense radars operating in contested electronic environments."

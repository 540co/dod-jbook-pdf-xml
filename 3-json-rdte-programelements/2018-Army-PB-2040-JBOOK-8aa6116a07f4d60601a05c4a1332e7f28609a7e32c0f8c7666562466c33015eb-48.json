            "val": "Warfighter Information Network - Tactical Increment 2 (WIN-T Inc 2) provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability. The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven Government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated network management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams to Company-level through FY2018. Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining situational awareness and mission command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30-Megabit per second aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that transmission paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or lose connectivity. This capability offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks. WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep mobile and dispersed forces networked through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts \u201cColorless Core\u201d technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the \u201ccore\u201d of the network. The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.\n\nInc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.\n\nFY18 funds support development efforts for Technical Insertions, support Operational Testing (Joint Warfighting Assessment 18), and support Next Generation Point of Presence (PoP) and Soldier Network Extension (SNE) efforts."

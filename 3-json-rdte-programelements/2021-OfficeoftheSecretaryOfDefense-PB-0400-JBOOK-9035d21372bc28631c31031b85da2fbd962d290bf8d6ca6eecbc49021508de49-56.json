The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.\n\nFY 2019 funding designed, procured, and produced all necessary materials to conduct and execute the Flight Experiment 2 (FE-2) on schedule.  FE-2 is the highest priority test element in the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) portfolio, with systems integration, production, and test data directly contributing to fielding an early operational capability.  In addition, FY 2019 funds were expended preparing for Flight Test 3 (FT-3) and Flight Experiment 3 (FE-3), enhancing the pace of test launches, and serving to refine booster and glide body data immediately prior to operational production and fielding.  FY 2019 funds were also invested to research and mature technologies critical to fielding effective hypersonic weapon systems.  These include: ordnance research (fuzing, effects and lethality); navigation, guidance, and control research to address operation in contested environments; test and evaluation research to improve the capabilities of broad ocean area test ranges; mission planning research; and structures and aerothermodynamics research.\n\nFunding reprogrammed into this PE was leveraged to support development, systems engineering, program management, test execution and planning for the Army Long Range Hypersonic Weapon system."

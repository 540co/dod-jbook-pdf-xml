Its mission is being broadened to expedite developing and fielding operationally focused capabilities for immediate and near-term needs as directed by the Space RCO Board of Directors. Key operating principles include a short and narrow chain of command, overarching programmatic insight, early and prominent war fighter involvement with small integrated operating teams within a single office. U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) has identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute\/replenish\/protect critical space capabilities to reserve \"continuity of operations\" capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage. Space RCO projects are optimized for prioritized theater use and\/or surge, augmentation, and replenishment of traditional space capabilities.\n\nThe Space RCO is ready to develop, test, train, and equip war fighter needs as they are identified at any time. First, the requirements must be validated by the commander, USSTRATCOM, acting through U.S. Space Command; second, the project must be approved by the Space RCO Board of Directors (BoD); third, the project will be executed by the Space RCO. If the effort is initiated during execution year, it will be described in the next year's budget exhibit.\n\nThe Space RCO is supporting the Electro-Optical\/Infrared Weather Systems (EWS) capability addressing weather gap 1 (cloud characterization) and gap 2 (theater weather imagery). ORS-8, which was to have been a gap-filler between the new EWS program of record, has been cancelled due to the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's (DMSP) end-of-life extending beyond the EWS potential launch date.  The EWS launch date in 2024 will provide coverage of gaps 1 and 2 after DMSP's end-of-life.  The Office is also developing the Space RCO Solar Power project to collect solar energy and provide uninterrupted, assured, and logistically agile power to expeditionary forces operating in unimproved areas such as forward operating bases. The remaining priorities are to satisfy the high priority needs for augmentation and reconstitution, including Missile Warning, Wideband Protected Communication, Narrowband Communication, Data Exfiltration, Space Situational Awareness, Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) imagery, Blue\/Friendly Force Situational Awareness, Maritime Domain Awareness, Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, Remote Access Solar Power, Weather, and Battlefield ISR.\n\nAdditional developments include visionary, tailored, and future Space\/Cyber projects to special operations forces (SOF) as well as to plan, develop, test and transition advanced technologies into space system prototypes and capabilities to meet known and emerging threats. Conduct architecture studies, modeling and stimulation, technical development, integration and test activities in preparation for transition of critical technologies into prototype or space program of record.\n\nThe FY2020 funding request was reduced by $9.0 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Space RCO weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems\/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. \nJTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is used as an institutional trainer though is available as a deployable asset.  JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. On 14 Jan 2016, the Army Acquisition Executive designated the JTAGS Pre-Planned Product Improvement (JTAGS P3I) program as a separate ACAT III modification program.\n\nThe JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  P3I Improvements upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and improves warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite delivering critical capabilities sooner. Phase 2\nSpiral 1 and Spiral 2 will be completed in FY 2020.   \n\n\nFY 2021 requested funding has been moved from PE 1208053A to PE 0208053A."

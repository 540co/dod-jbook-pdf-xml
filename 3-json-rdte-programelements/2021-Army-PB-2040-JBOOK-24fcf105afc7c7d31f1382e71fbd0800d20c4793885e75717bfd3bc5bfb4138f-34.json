            "val": "The Information Systems Security Program funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nProject 491: Army CIO\/G6 manages Project 491\n\nProject 491: Information Assurance (IA) Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks. This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)\/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan (AMSP).  \n\nIA Development funding implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities in coordination with the NSA, the DISA, and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI). Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future material solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the COMSEC Implementation Planning Guidance to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of CS capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan. This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS, System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) for Army Capability Sets for CS\/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks.\n\nProject 491 FY 2021 Justification:  This funding supports the continuation of providing oversight for the executions of the Army's COMSEC Modernization initiatives including major ACC updates and replacements of existing devices and systems to meet NSA mandates. Continue to support the evaluation and testing of new technologies for Army implementation in support of CM2, KMI migration and S-ICAN\/ITN architecture implementation. Support efforts to provide updated end-to-end, tactical-to-strategic COMSEC standardization and implementation guidance to meet Army's operational requirements. to assess new key management technologies developed by DoD joint KMI program to determine the maturity for Army fielding to protect and strengthen the Army Network posture. and to work with DoD CIO, NSA, DISA and other Services to resolve cryptographic interoperability issues for both embedded and standalone systems and performed risk reduction testing of commercial products prior to insertion into Army for use to increase operational availability with documented operational value and rapid integration. Provide timely test and evaluate results to enable the Army to make sound investment strategic decisions and to reduce or eliminate duplications. Also supports efforts to update and develop policies to posture Army's operations to implement innovative cryptographic and key management tools and services. and to participate in DoD and Army working groups to develop plans for CM2 implementation. Perform System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) to provide protections for the Army Integrated Tactical Networks.\n\nThe Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems. Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield. It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics. Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access. The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems.\n\nProject DV4 & DV5: COMSEC is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. These efforts are consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG). These funding lines support the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nProject DV4: The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) KMI ACAT IAM program, automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution. AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute Cryptographic data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence (C5I) systems. AKMI devices receive, store, manage, and transfer electronic key through the network to be loaded into communication devices such as radios and satellites to secure the network. Without this technology Warfighters are required to manually receive their cryptographic products by traveling to COMSEC account locations (which may not be co-located) and manually fill their devices. \n\nProject DV4 FY 2021 Justification: This funding line supports COMSEC technologies within the Army with allocations for the following: $1M, Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE) to create a secure, reprogrammable cryptographic engine in providing Cryptographic Modernized Capabilities including future Over the Network Keying (OTNK) to Fill Devices and End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s; $12.346M to perform the systems integration and UAS development for the Next Generation Load Device - Medium (NGLD-M) to conduct the Army's key fill mission by issuing, filling, and managing Cryptographic keys to both legacy and future KMI aware End-Cryptographic Units (ECUs). This technology requires RDT&E investment to meet the requirements outlined in the NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD). This effort an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) Program of Record (POR); $0.111M to Program Management Support, funds a matrixed Acquisition Program Manager (APM) from Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center to manage the NGLD-M development effort.\n\nProject DV5: Crypto Modernization (Crypto Mod) performs test, evaluation, development, and configuration management for cryptographic devices that receive key through fill devices and allow for secure communication through Army devices such as radios and satellite terminals. This program utilizes National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks. The effort supports network operations from end-to-end throughout the force and the Common Operating Environment (COE) thus mitigating networked vulnerabilities to Army information security systems. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required be upgraded to modern algorithms to meet emerging threat developed by our adversaries. Crypto Modernization necessitates the utilization of the latest NSA cryptographic capabilities in order to defeat adversarial efforts to decrypt, disrupt, or exploit US Army networks. COMSEC is the Army's implementation of NSA protections to create a unified network that is protected, resilient, and survivable.\n\nProject DV5 FY 2021 Justification: The program continues testing and evaluation of COMSEC devices to confirm capability and interoperability on Army networks and tactical systems as well as identifying risk areas for compliance with COMSEC regulations and procedures. The program will test and evaluate Crypto Systems compliant devices, Suite B IPSec devices built on commercial standards, Cryptographic High Value Product (CHVP), Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Guidance, and new software releases to High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) 4.X devices in accordance with AR 700-142 Revision dated 8 June 2018. The program tests interoperability and provides ways to insert Data At Rest (DAR) and Data In Transit (DIT) technology within the existing and future network infrastructure. Additionally, this program evaluates performance of technologies and provides direction to ensure the lowest impact on performance while providing the greatest protection from loss of sensitive data.\n\nProject ET9: Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) program was canceled FY 2018. No FY 2021 funding is requested.\n\nProject FF8: User activity monitoring (UAM) automation\/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection."

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.\n\nCommunications Security (COMSEC) is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms.\n\nAs part of the Army's Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) implementation, the Next Generation Load Device - Medium (NGLD-M) is an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) Program of Record (POR) and modernized load device that will replace approximately 144,000 legacy AN\/PYQ-10A and AN\/PYQ-10A(C) (Army), which is commonly referred to as the Simple Key Loader (SKL). The NGLD-M will receive, store, manage, and transfer electronic key through the network to be loaded into communication devices such as radios and satellites to secure the network. The SKL has been in the field for 14 years and does not support modernized network concepts and faces battery life attrition among early versions of the device. The NGLD-M will fulfill the current and modernized Army network concepts which will improve operational readiness, adaptiveness, and survivability of the Warfighters supporting the COMSEC requirements for approximately 1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (devices that consume cryptographic key to enable encrypted communication such as a radio or secure phone). The NGLD-M requires RDT&E investment to develop and test the hardware and software solutions to meet the operational requirements outlined in the NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) to modernize fill devices with capability to transfer and receive cryptographic key over a network to reduce causalities and maintain mission OPTEMPO. Without this technology Warfighters are required to manually receive their cryptographic products by traveling to COMSEC account locations (which may not be co-located) and manually filling their devices. \n\nThe Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE) is a government owned reprogrammable cryptographic chip that incorporates KMI functionality and modern algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages for the embedding. This chip could be adapted for use within the NGLD-M or any other cryptographic communications system."

There is no commercially driven market for Type-1 certified load devices that meet the requirements identified in the NGLD Family CPD. These requirements ensure secure communications by requiring the NGLD-M to provide specific tamper protections, limit electromagnetic radiation to prevent adversarial detection of the system, among others outlined  within the Information Assurance Security Requirements Document. The NGLD-M acquisition also supports organic development of the User Application Software to reduce the life-cycle sustainment for the system. \n\nArmy Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) consists of Programs of Record (POR) as well as Non PORs under Project Lead Network Enablers (PL Net E). AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record. The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks such as radios, secure phones, and satellite terminals.\n\nAKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12. The AKMI Program will include the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family.\n\nThe NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program. The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium and large) to meet the AKMI requirements. The AKMI program has partnered with Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the government owner Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE) that can be utilized by NGLD-M or other COMSEC devices. The NGLD-M will undergo full-and-open competition for development, production, and sustainment with a projected FY20 award. NGLD-M development will be conducted during FY19-22 culminating in NSA certification and an operational event. \n\nThe Milestone Decision Authority issued a Materiel Development Decision (MDD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 14 March 2019 that designated the NGLD-M as an ACAT III Program of Record (PoR) and authorized execution of Fiscal Year 2019 RDT&E funds for acquisition planning and risk mitigation."

Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy. Communications Security (COMSEC) is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510.\n\nCrypto Mod performs test, evaluation, development, and configuration management for cryptographic devices that receive key through fill devices and allow for secure communication through Army devices such as radios and satellite terminals. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required be upgraded to modern algorithms to meet emerging threat developed by our adversaries. Crypto Modernization necessitates the utilization of the latest National Security Agency (NSA) cryptographic capabilities in order to defeat adversarial efforts to decrypt, disrupt, or exploit US Army networks. Communications Security (COMSEC) is the Army's implementation of NSA protections to create a unified network that is protected, resilient, and survivable.\n\nTo accomplish this multi-faceted effort, consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan, Crypto Mod performs evaluation of emerging threats, development of advances protections to defeat these threats, testing of commercial and government off the shelf applications developed to provide protections against identified threats, and assessment of new software and hardware updates to these end user devices and software to ensure they remain hardened against cyber-attack. This ensures that all endpoints from singular NIPRNET, SIPRNET, JWICS and Intelligence workstations in the strategic Enterprise to Tactical vehicles and equipment utilized by dismounted personnel forward deployed in hot zone are protected when processing the critical mission and voice data that provides the strategic overmatch required to accomplish the Army's mission."

The objective of the Crypto Mod program is to provide adaptive, flexible, and programmable cryptographic systems using best practices, lessons learned and programmatic management to meet the challenge of modernizing the Army's aging cryptographic systems. To support this objective, the Cryptographic Systems Program utilizes NSA contracts in order to procure devices. All existing and emerging encryptors are then tested and evaluated for Functionality, Security, Interoperability, and backward compatibility on software and hardware for both Tactical and Enterprise systems and assessments of new software and hardware updates to end user devices and software to ensure they remain hardened against cyber-attack. The effort will support the network operations from end-to-end throughout the force and the Common Operating Environment (COE) thus mitigating networked vulnerabilities to Army information security systems.

Support the Unified Network key near term imperative of achieving air-ground integration. Crypto modernization will ensure compliance with Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), add algorithms that address cyber vulnerabilities, improve 'secure but unclassified' network support, and provide better support to coalition interoperability.\n\nEmbedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms. Tactical radios using legacy embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk."

The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection."

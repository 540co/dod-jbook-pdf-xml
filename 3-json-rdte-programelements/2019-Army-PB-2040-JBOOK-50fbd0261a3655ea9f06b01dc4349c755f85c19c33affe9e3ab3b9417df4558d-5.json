            "val": "The Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions. These projects will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats. To achieve this, the Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.\n\nProject 694: 30x113mm Linked Ammunition: Develop and qualify 30x113mm linked ammunition for ground vehicles by increasing precision and lethality capability to defeat personnel and materiel targets as well as the Joint Urgent Operational Need to counter the rapidly evolving threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems. This effort will qualify the links for use in existing M788 and M789 ammunition and develop airburst capable munitions fired from the Lightweight 30x113mm Link Fed Chain Gun. FY 2019 funds will be used to purchase links and linked ammunition, conduct weapon system integration, testing and evaluation, and support the Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) of the 30x113mm weapon system.\n\nHigh Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm LV HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M203\/M320 Grenade Launchers. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased effective ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability.\n\nThe 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munitions - Tracer (PABM-T) Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) program funds the qualification and procurement of a PABM-T cartridge for rapid fielding in support of the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) for Increased Lethality. The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV). The cartridge will provide an airburst capability with increased effectiveness against personnel in the open and in defilade over the current tactical solutions.\n\nProject EB8: The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full day\/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability. 7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm and .50 caliber cartridges. FY 2019 funding supports continued testing and evaluation of the 5.56mm prototype solutions in order to attain a Technology Level Readiness (TRL) of 6 in FY 2020.\n\nProject EB9: This project is to support the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM). These advanced decoys are necessary to address emerging threats and capabilities deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from theatre. Continue to develop and prepare documentation for Milestone A decision for the Radar Guided decoy. This decoy is designed to defeat specific threat types. Details of their operation is classified. Conduct initial developmental\/operational testing on Cloud CM.\n\nProject EC2: The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158. The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm. The FY 2019 funding focuses on calibers below 7.62mm. The objective is to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.  This project is a New Start FY 2019.\n\nProject EC3: This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2019 funding will be used to complete verification testing and an operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system. FY 2019 funding will also continue verification testing of a next generation temperature\/humidity sensor with batch interrogation and historical data retention capabilities, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability, and continue the maturation of the design and fabrication of prototype plastic polymer rectangular containers for developmental 5.56mm ammunition.\n\nProject EL7: The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. FY 2019 funding will support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Request for Proposal (RFP), Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award. Funding will also explore lessons learned from the United States Marine Corp (USMC) .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort and other various options to satisfy the .50 Caliber reduced range requirement.\n\nProject EL8: The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The goal of the LSCA Project is to reduce the total Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight. The LSCA Project will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges. The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun.\n\nProject EU1: The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) project evaluates, develops, matures, and demonstrates new lethality technologies for 155mm cannon artillery munitions and evaluates their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD). The ELCM project prototypes and accelerates the maturation of enhanced lethality technologies, such as Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT) or pre-formed fragmentation, for 155mm cannon artillery munitions. The ELCM project accelerates the development and maturation of LFT for subsequent integration on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition, 22 December 2016. ELCM also supports prototyping of enhanced lethality technologies applicable to 155mm cannon artillery munitions, including prototyping of projectile design, explosive formulations, fragmentation, and software for the 155mm XM1113 effort, which is a potential long-range cannon projectile that will increase range by 10km or greater and contain twice as much rocket motor grains as the current 155mm long range cannon projectile that is now obsolete. The design requires increased lethality since the projectile contains a reduced amount of explosive to make room for the increased amount of rocket motor grains required for increased range. ELCM addresses requirements for increased lethality above the current U.S. Army go-to-war 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles, the M795 Insensitive Munition and obsolete M549A1 Unitary Munition.\n\nProject EU2: The Improved Multi-Option Fuze (iMOFA\/iMOFM) project will identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate new improved multi-option fuze technologies, components, and subsystems based on Government-owned Next Generation Proximity Sensor (NGPS) capabilities with built-in exportability attributes previously matured via OSD sponsored tech base efforts under the Joint Fuze Technology Program and Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Congressional Pilot Program. This project will support technology maturation and risk reduction, and will evaluate and analyze producibility, affordability, safety, and compatibility of these prototype potential materiel solutions in representative realistic performance-related developmental tests. This project will enable fact-based analysis of new Government-owned height of burst\/proximity fuzing alternatives that are resistant to enemy countermeasures and reverse engineering threats, quantify their effectiveness, reduce integration risk, and support transition into existing\/new artillery\/mortar fuzes and munitions.\n\nProject FA5: The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions (APWM) project is a continuation of efforts initiated under 644120A-ED5. The objective of this advanced risk mitigation, prototyping and product support effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems in a system of systems environment. The APWM efforts directly support three of the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA) \"Big 6\" Modernization Priorities. Specifically, they support; Long Range Precision Fires, Network\/C3I (incl Assured PNT), and Soldier Lethality. The APWM project will enable increased lethality and ensure future battlefield success against peer\/near-peer adversaries by supporting these Modernization Priorities. Current and evolving threats to existing Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities have created the need for new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both Munitions and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment. This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense. As such, both precision weapon and munition programs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army's Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments. FY 2019 funding will support the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's MGUE program and the Army's Assured PNT program including participation in design reviews, evaluation and formal feedback on systems requirements and technology performance, component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a system-of-systems environment, configuration management of the evolving Joint Common GPS Specification and Interface Control Document for Precision Guided Munitions, and specific support focus includes requirements for MGUE Increment 2, Pseudolites (PL), and Alternative Navigation (AltNav) related technology maturity for Assured PNT milestone decisions.\n\nProject FG1: The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project will analyze, identify, develop, prototype, and demonstrate 155mm Cannon Artillery munition area effects capability. C-DAEM are envisioned as a suite of 155mm artillery munitions, to provide U.S. ground forces with a capability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize and\/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area. Initial objective values for C-DAEM would meet Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) effects capabilities against personnel and light vehicles and exceed DPICM effects capabilities against armor. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed to best inform necessary area effect lethality requirements. The Project addresses requirements from the U.S. Army adopted U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) [Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) adopted 20 October 2016, Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved 11 May 2016]. The approved C-DAEM ICD as an Army requirement is located in the Capabilities and Army Requirements Documents number 0438. The Joint Staffing Designator is JROC Interest. FY 2019 will support the preparation and evaluation of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for technologies and capabilities identified through the AoA, as well as the development of the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) for each technology.\n\nProject XT5: Lightweight 30mmx113mm (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6. The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel\/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel & soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. FY 2019 continues to support the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction effort."

This effort will qualify the links for use in existing M788 and M789 ammunition and develop airburst capable munitions fired from the Lightweight 30x113mm Link Fed Chain Gun.  FY 2019 funds will be used to purchase links and linked ammunition, conduct weapon system integration, testing and evaluation, and support the Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) of the 30x113mm weapon system.\n\nHigh Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The 40mm LV HEAB tactical cartridge allows the warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M203\/M320 Grenade Launchers. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions at increased effective ranges with greater accuracy and lethality. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel at increased ranges beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge.  The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges increasing Soldier Survivability.\n\nThe 30x173mm Programmable Airburst Munitions - Tracer (PABM-T) Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) program funds the qualification and procurement of a PABM-T cartridge for rapid fielding in support of the Stryker Operational Needs Statement (ONS) for Increased Lethality. The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV). The cartridge will provide an airburst capability with increased effectiveness against personnel in the open and in defilade over the current tactical solutions."

The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full day\/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm is the immediate focus followed by 5.56mm and .50 caliber cartridges.

These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments.  Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms.  These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform Program Managers (PMs) with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from theatre.  Continue to develop and prepare documentation for Milestone A decision for the Radar Guided decoy.  This decoy is designed to defeat specific threat types. Details of their operation is classified.

Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.  The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield.  This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  FY 2019 funding will be used to complete verification testing and an operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system.  FY 2019 funding will also continue verification testing of a next generation temperature\/humidity sensor with batch interrogation and historical data retention capabilities, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability, and continue the maturation of the design and fabrication of prototype plastic polymer rectangular containers for developmental 5.56mm ammunition."

The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions.  The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ.  This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges.  The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  FY 2019 funding will support Milestone (MS) B activities to include Request for Proposal (RFP), Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract award.  Funding will also explore lessons learned from the United States Marine Corp (USMC) .50 Caliber Reduced Range Ammunition effort and other various options to satisfy the .50 Caliber reduced range requirement."

The ELCM project prototypes and accelerates the maturation of enhanced lethality technologies, such as Lithographic Fragmentation Technology (LFT) or pre-formed fragmentation, for 155mm cannon artillery munitions. The ELCM project accelerates the development and maturation of LFT for subsequent integration on the 155mm XM1128 high explosive projectile per HQDA G-8 Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition, 22 December 2016. ELCM also supports prototyping of enhanced lethality technologies applicable to 155mm cannon artillery munitions, including prototyping of projectile design, explosive formulations, fragmentation, and software for the 155mm XM1113 effort, which is a potential long-range cannon projectile that will increase range by 10km or greater and contain twice as much rocket motor grains as the current 155mm long range cannon projectile that is now obsolete. The design requires increased lethality since the projectile contains a reduced amount of explosive to make room for the increased amount of rocket motor grains required for increased range. ELCM addresses requirements for increased lethality above the current U.S. Army go-to-war 155mm high explosive unitary projectiles, the M795 Insensitive Munition and obsolete M549A1 Unitary Munition."

The objective of this advanced risk mitigation, prototyping and product support effort is to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems in a system of systems environment.  The APWM efforts directly support three of the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA) \"Big 6\" Modernization Priorities.  Specifically, they support; Long Range Precision Fires, Network\/C3I (incl Assured PNT), and Soldier Lethality.  The APWM project will enable increased lethality and ensure future battlefield success against peer\/near-peer adversaries by supporting these Modernization Priorities. Current and evolving threats to existing Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities have created the need for new\/emerging Assured PNT capabilities (including M-Code GPS and Pseudolites) into both Munitions and Weapons operating in a complex system-of-systems environment.  This imperative is reinforced by Public Law 111-383 Section 913 which mandates the use of Air Force-developed M-Code GPS capabilities in all systems fielded FY2018 and beyond unless a waiver is obtained from the Secretary of Defense.  As such, both precision weapon and munition programs must coordinate with the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program and the Army's Assured PNT program to protect and insure critical precision-based Joint warfighting capabilities as well as maximizing effectiveness and efficiency of US taxpayer investments.  FY 2019 funding will support the development and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's MGUE program and the Army's Assured PNT program including participation in design reviews, evaluation and formal feedback on systems requirements and technology performance, component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a system-of-systems environment, configuration management of the evolving Joint Common GPS Specification and Interface Control Document for Precision Guided Munitions (PGM), and specific support focus includes requirements for MGUE Increment 2, Pseudolites (PL), and Alternative Navigation (AltNav) related technology maturity for Assured PNT milestone decisions."

C-DAEM are envisioned as a suite of 155mm artillery munitions, to provide U.S. ground forces with a capability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize and\/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  Initial objective values for C-DAEM would meet Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) effects capabilities against personnel and light vehicles and exceed DPICM effects capabilities against armor.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) will be completed to best inform necessary area effect lethality requirements.  The Project addresses requirements from the U.S. Army adopted U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) [Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) adopted 20 October 2016, Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved 11 May 2016].  The approved C-DAEM ICD as an Army requirement is located in the Capabilities and Army Requirements Documents number 0438.  The Joint Staffing Designator is JROC Interest.  FY 2019 will support the preparation and evaluation of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for technologies and capabilities identified through the AoA, as well as the development of the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) for each technology."

The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel\/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel & soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects. FY 2019 continues to support the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction effort."

Funding supports policy and guidance for incorporation of alternative means of PNT delivery to augment GPS. Funding also supports the DoD\u2019s PNT Oversight Council and inputs into interagency activities under the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee. \nThe Integrated Planning and Management Project encompasses the National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office's (NMO) responsibilities for establishing overall DoD policy and oversight with respect to the capability development, interoperability, standards, and architecture for National and Nuclear Command Capabilities for our National Leadership.  The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO\u2019s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office with oversight of a wide range of DoD command, control, and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Three overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, National Security\/Emergency Preparedness (NS\/EP), DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Nuclear C2, Integrated Missile Defense, Tactical Warning, Global Strike; and 3) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings.\n\nThe Mission Assurance Risk Management System (MARMS) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management system that directly supports the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Mission Assurance (MA) responsibilities as defined in the DoD Directive (DoDD) 3020.40, Mission Assurance, with the objectives of creating resilience and supporting critical processes to enable the protection of assets and ensuring defense critical missions. MARMS will function as an integration framework spanning multiple security domains that will support risk-informed decision-making, resource investment, and improved synchronization at different levels within DoD. MARMS supports multiple Joint Capability Areas (JCA): Command and Control, Logistics, and Protection. MARMS is an acquisition category (ACAT) III software program and has a \u201chigh\u201d impact value for each of the three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01 and the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253.\n\n\nDefense Architecture Support includes development, analysis, testing and evaluation of DoD IT Enterprise Reference and solution architecture products in support of the DoD's Joint Information Environment and the closely related Mission Partner Environment.  This work also includes improvements to processes that support registration and storage of the Department's enterprise architecture (formerly called DARS). The Department maintains a catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to store, search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data through capabilities provided by the architecture portal.  The portal is a central, federated hub for discovery, accessibility, understandability, and reusability of architectures.  With the ability to import different architecture tool data and display disparate architecture data in a uniform, consistent method for ease of use and understanding.  The portal provides a federated environment for sharing of architectures, mission threads, and other related capability integrated information between various authoritative repositories to increase effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making in a dynamic environment by our customers.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the Defense Architecture Support program focus on: (1) Research and Development of JIE and MPE architectures, (2) Making JIE and MPE architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build \"composite\" integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO's collaborate in the development of federation web services via the Enterprise Architecture and Engineering Panel under the oversight of the DoD CIOs Enterprise Architecture and Service Board to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model, enterprise services, data and technical standards."

The DoD FM-CTRT replaces the WHS FM Learning Management System (LMS) DoD Financial Management Certification Program (DFMCP) system of record.

When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current time line for the first phase is estimated to be completed by December 2017. The follow on phase for DATA Act and remaining systems in scope will require development activities through September 2018. This effort complies with the NDAA requirement to use big data technologies to support financial audits."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "As the Department of Defense strategic, operational, and tactical plans and objectives transform the war fighter with new capabilities and doctrine, the budgeting and accountability of funds used to pursue the Department objectives will become more complicated and detailed for senior leaders to make decisions with supporting rationale for the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C).\n  \nNEXT GENERATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:\nThe Department\u2019s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD\u2019s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nToday, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.\n\nThere is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller\u2019s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.\n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.\n\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION TRACKING AND REPORTING TOOL:\n\nThe Defense Financial Management Certification Program (DFMCP) meets the business requirement to comply with section 1051 of the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Public Law 112-81, authorizing the Secretary of Defense to establish a certification program for the 54,000 Financial Management (FM) workforce in order to improve audit readiness and analytic capability.  \n\nThe Department of Defense has a requirement to strengthen the professional development of the DoD financial management workforce and to ensure that DoD financial managers are properly trained to meet current and future requirements to support the Warfighter.  The DFMCP is the approved strategy to meet this requirement.  The DFMCP needs a tracking and reporting tool for web-based course training and exams, a robust reporting capability for standard and ad hoc reports, a course search capability, sort filtering capability, and a capability to attach multiple documents once the training certification requirements are completed.  The tool will self-guides users through the policies and procedures required by the program, without the burden of extensive training on how to use the system itself.  The tool will enable program operations, with embedded business rules, that represent policy and procedures, and have internal controls that prevent improper actions.  The tool will be intuitive, track and record activities, and enable users to perform correct actions the first time.  The tool will provide a reporting tool that furnishes leadership with near real time management reports concerning FM Workforce Certification Qualifications and be adaptable to reasonable changes in DFMCP policies and procedures.\n\nUNIVERSE OF TRANSACTIONS:\nFunding will support financial audit. A Universe of Transaction (UoT) inclusive of all Department of Defense (DoD) Wide Appropriation General Fund (TI-97) information is needed to support reconciliation of fifteen General Fund accounting systems, reconciliation of eighteen business feeder systems to general fund accounting system, and validating UoT capabilities through the audit examinations of DCMA and DoDEA.\n\t\nThe DoD TI-97 UoT requires:\n\u2022 All supporting TI-97 data that rolls up to the DoD financial statement (detailed accounting data reconciled to the financial statement)\n\u2022 Proof of the completeness of all transactional data reported within the UoT (detailed accounting data reconciled to business events)\n\u2022 Ability to extract subset populations\n\u2022 Ability to secure and protect the data within the UoT\n\nThe failure to meet these requirements will result in the Department unable to successfully conduct and pass an audit.\n\nTo achieve these requirements, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is creating a tool called the Auditable Universe of Data Intelligence Tool (AUD-IT).  This tool has the potential to significantly improve DoD\u2019s capability and capacity to handle large volumes of standard and non-standard financial data.  Both an application and analytical platform, the AUD-IT leverages an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications to deliver a complete UoT for TI-97.  \n\nThe first phase of AUD-IT implementation is a proof of concept with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) systems to develop a baseline application and configuration.  When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current timeline for the proof of concept is estimated to be completed by December 2017.\n\nAUD-IT is a joint effort between Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO), Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (ODCMO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), USSOCOM, and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)."

LMS has performed barely adequately in implementing the certification program. A fair assessment by the program office is that despite three years of providing, improving and proliferating training, most FM LMS users and administrators cannot use the LMS proficiently. The result from the users\u2019 perspectives is that the program is flawed, that achievement of certification is unnecessarily difficult, and that instead of enabling the DFMCP, the FM LMS is an obstacle to be surmounted. The FM workforce\u2019s frustration with the FM LMS was raised by the Military Department Comptrollers and the Directors of the DFAS and DCAA as the most significant issue with the new FM Certification Program and an issue requiring immediate resolution.  This culminated with an Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) decision to explore other alternatives to the current FM LMS.  The existing FM LMS is a cumbersome and expensive system.\n\nThis effort is to plan, develop, test and implement the DoD Financial Management Certification Tracking and Reporting Tool (FM-CTRT) as a more efficient and cost effective solution."

When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current time line for the first phase is estimated to be completed by December 2017. The follow on phase for DATA Act and remaining systems in scope will require development activities through September 2018. This effort complies with the NDAA requirement to use big data technologies to support financial audits."

All DoD organizations are pursuing the current statutory goal of achieving the state of audit readiness (target September 30, 2017) that supports entry into a full financial statement of audit in FY 2018 (target start date March 2018) with an initial opinion rendered in mid-FY 2019.  Without an automated capability to provide a transactional universe for sampling and evidentiary proof the department will not be in compliance with public law. \n\nThe requested funds will be used to buy \u201cBig Data\u201d software and hardware infrastructure and required contractor services to implement the technology to meet the UoT requirement. \nThis UFR includes subject matter expertise costs for DCFO and funds to be placed on a contract for hardware, software, and labor.  This will not result in hiring additional government personnel. \n\nThe UoT will have the capability to:\n\u2022\tIngest data from multiple accounting and financial feeder systems\n\u2022\tNormalize data from multiple sources providing a common data architecture\n\u2022\tReconcile transactional details to summary financial data\n\u2022\tProvide auditor\u2019s the ability to sample TI-97 detailed transactions\n\u2022\tBusiness Analytics\/Reporting\n\u2022\tDATA Act which is a statutory requirement to be completed by May 2017\n\u2022\tProvide NIPR and SIPR capability for non-sensitive and sensitive data\n\nThis effort is a proof of concept focused on USSOCOM, but will apply to all TI-97 general fund entities.  The scope is to bring in data from an estimated 50 systems and demonstrate existence and completeness of business and accounting transaction data, which are capabilities required for audit readiness."

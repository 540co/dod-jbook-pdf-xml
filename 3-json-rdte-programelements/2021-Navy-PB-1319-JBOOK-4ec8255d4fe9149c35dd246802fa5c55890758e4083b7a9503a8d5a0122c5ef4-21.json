            "val": "The FY 2020 to FY 2021 decrease is due to FY 2020 Congressional Adds for silicon carbide power modules, advanced power electronics integration and surface combatant component-level prototyping. The FY 2020 to FY 2021 increase in PU 2471 funds the design and build of the modular scalable shipboard multi-application Energy Magazine (EM) which enables new pulsed, high power directed energy weapons (lasers) and sensors.  FY 2020 competitively awarded contracts to up to two (2) vendors fulfills the need for at least two (2) viable sources of supply for EM with lithium ion batteries, and\/or capacitors and or flywheel based energy storage systems and power electronics for shipboard applications.  FY 2021 includes resource requirements for characterization and qualification of lithium ion battery based energy storage to safe and reliable shipboard service.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) includes the development of advanced surface ship Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&E) components and systems for all future ships and back-fit ships where appropriate as well as development of Situational Awareness, Boundary Enforcement & Response (SABER) prototype hardware for cybersecurity protections of HM&E systems for applicable surface ships. This PE is managed by PMS 320, the Electric Ships Office, located organizationally within PEO SHIPS, responsible for developing Naval Power and Energy Systems that focus power system integration of Directed Energy (DE) and other high-powered mission systems as well as platform integration and improving energy efficiency of those components and systems.  The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable and more capable electric power systems for all Navy platforms, focus Navy and industry investments, and reduce total ownership cost. PEO Ships AM manages the SABER hardware development effort.\n\nThis PE serves as the bridge between Science and Technology (S&T) and ship platform and mission systems acquisition programs by identifying prospective applications for S&T research, advanced development, and performing additional product development and qualification when necessary to meet platform or mission system requirements."

This project supports optimized integration of Directed Energy (DE) and other high powered mission systems, appropriate component and system controls, integration of components and systems into future and current ships, and providing power and energy system solution alternatives to new and existing platforms. Existing ships' power systems require optimized integration via energy storage and advanced controls techniques to withstand the effects of DE and other high powered mission systems and avoid negative impacts to power generating equipment (diesel\/gas turbine engines and generators).  \n\nProject developments are aligned with the Navy's 30 year shipbuilding plan via the Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (TDR), which outlines the way ahead for future developments and provides a basis for coordinated planning and investment by the Navy and private industry. \n\nThis project develops and transitions products that electrically integrate and provide power to mission systems, integrates those components and systems into ship platforms, increases energy efficiency, and provides cybersecurity capabilities for current in-service Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems as well as future systems. \n\nThe systems developed by this Project are the power and energy foundation of the ships kill chain, and are developed with efficiency requirements as part of total life cycle cost minimization.  Efforts within Power and Energy Systems are to design, develop, test and integrate shipboard power systems to incorporate advanced sensors, directed energy and other advanced weapons. Design and testing includes modeling and simulation, as well as land based testing, to reduce risk and demonstrate readiness for shipboard use.   \n\nCybersecurity: This PU will develop and test various SABER prototype hardware that monitors the HM&E network and system communications to detect potential cyber attacks.  SABER hardware will transition to appropriate back-fit and forward fit ship installations, as appropriate, once development and testing completes.

Prior to FY 2021, this PE has designed, built, and tested at the Center for Advanced Power System at Florida State University (FSU CAPS) the Energy Storage Module (ESM) prototype, the Energy Magazine Bread Board (to test active front end technology to enable peak shaving) and multiple other energy storage devices designed and built outside of this PE.  These include the United Kingdom (UK) Flywheel Energy Storage System, the Johns Hopkins University Adaptable Power Supply, and the Northrop Grumman Energy Storage System.  This testing has de-risked the Energy Magazine technical specification and increased Navy expertise in the use of advanced energy storage technologies.  Energy Storage is a key enabler for high-powered directed energy weapons.  The stored energy of the Energy Magazine is required to supplement typical ship service power so that large pulsed loads do not directly tie to the electrical power generator, which potentially damages the shipboard power system.  The Energy Magazine consists of power electronics, energy storage media, and controls.  The Energy Magazine is a common, modular, scalable intermediate power system that standardizes energy storage across multiple mission systems and ships classes, eliminating wasteful need for mission systems to each develop, build, test and qualify\/certify their own unique energy storage systems.  The Energy Magazine also provides stable backup power functionality and leads to reduction of uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) aboard ship.  Approximately 30-40% of the cabinet components that support weapons and sensing systems are power conditioning; these can be functionally replaced by the Energy Magazine as a more universal power conditioning and energy storage unit that is ship power \"reloadable\" for multiple directed energy engagements.  The Energy Magazine is designed for both new construction and back-fit applications where advanced combat systems loads are being deployed.  \n\nEnergy Magazine-Prototype (EM-P):  Continue to execute the Energy Magazine - Prototype (EM-P) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).  Specific FY21 efforts include:  order all material, complete build, and conduct Test Readiness Reviews prior to testing the EM-P, conduct first article and factory testing, verify through testing that the EM Prototype performance meets the physical, functional and performance requirements.  Continue to support PEO IWS and ONR laser testing.  Evaluate performance of the EM prototype and, as applicable, incorporate lessons learned into EM procurement.  Commence preparation of test plans and procedures and test site modifications. \n\nEnergy Magazine (EM):  Continue executing Energy Magazine (EM) contracts awarded competitively in FY20 to up to two (2) vendors to fulfill the need for at least two (2) viable sources of supply for EM with lithium ion batteries, and\/or capacitors, and\/or flywheel energy storage and power electronics for shipboard applications.  Complete EM preliminary design, commence detailed design, complete S9310-AQ-SAF-010 characterization for Li Batteries \/ Flywheel Technology Readiness Level (TRL) demonstration, order Long Lead Time Material (LLTM), and prepare to build the prototype units, including strengthening vendor industrial base relationships to ensure receipt of hardware on time to maintain schedule.  \n  \n    -- Design activities include:  Complete requirements analysis to transition Navy requirements into design, performance and operational environment requirements from which system configuration items (e.g. subsystem and major components) can be designed, integrated and tested; interface management to coordinate interface requirements, assess and document performance in the areas of acoustics, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI); transient stability, load flow, harmonic and system fault analysis; trade-off analyses used to arrive at the design, details of methods used in the design process, the status of the risk management efforts, an assessment of the impact of cost drivers in the design, and a program review of the status of the design to date; and, thermal analysis, mechanical stress analysis, modal analysis, electrical insulation stress analysis, critical charge levels, flame resistance and toxicity of self-extinguishing insulation material, vibration and shock.  \n\n    -- Prepare and deliver a Preliminary Design Report and conduct a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to review key performance parameters along with preliminary component designs, control philosophy and documentation, system functional requirements, interface requirements, size, weight, electromagnetic fields and interference criteria, thermal management, and performance requirements.   \n\n    -- Fabricate the artifacts to be used in destructive characterization testing for energy storage based on each vendors' designs, conduct characterization testing, and prepare certification data needed for the approval to install the Energy Magazine at Navy land based facilities for testing and for installation aboard ship.  Complete appropriate drawings describing the LLTM component usage, prepare LLTM specifications of the LLTM components, and procure LLTM.\n\n    -- Continue to conduct system simulations that focus on EM performance, generate and validate detailed interface requirements, test scenarios and sequences, and incorporate in Power Hardware In the Loop (PHIL) demonstration(s).\n\nIntegrated Power and Energy System (IPES): An IPES is described in the Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (NPES TDR) as an advanced power architecture that incorporates multi-use distributed energy storage as well as advanced controls and energy management.  An IPES is an evolution of an Integrated Power System (IPS), specifically from that installed on DDG 1000.  Changes from IPS on DDG 1000 range from system level improvements such as variable speed prime movers, higher bus voltages, common intra-zone power conversion, improved electrical disconnects, advanced circuit protection, and cybersecurity to component and device improvements such as increased efficiency and performance leveraging industry's advancements in power conversion technology since DDG 1000 was designed.  IPES is a system that fully integrates all generated and stored electrical energy in the ship platform so that it is available to all electrical users, including high power weapons, advanced sensors, and electric propulsion, as mission scenarios dictate.  IPES removes the need for individual Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) now proliferating on ships.  An IPES breaks this paradigm of stove piped energy storage and allows all users to benefit from common, shared sources of energy whether that be for mission systems or providing ride through power for mission critical systems or ship systems.  Ship power systems today do not have the capability to share energy resources.  In FY21, continue to conduct feasibility studies, cost based assessments, computer real time simulations, and develop technical and performance specifications for an Integrated Power & Energy System (IPES) in support of Future Surface Combatant power and energy requirements. Identify shared energy storage and advanced controls requirements enabling an affordable, scalable and flexible power system to meet current and future needs. Refine IPES notional architectures and risk assessments through studies and industry engagement. Draft performance specifications for IPES system, equipment and components.  Continue to engage in robust component-level prototyping of potential new critical systems, including those related to propulsion and electrical distribution in support of future surface combatants to the maximum extent possible.  Execute computer component models and system level modeling and simulation efforts. Plan for land based testing activities focused on testing prototypes, validating specifications and standards and interfaces, and functionality of advanced controls.\n    \nIn order to obtain early insight into the effects of high power and energy mission systems on ships electric power systems, evaluate shipboard power and energy systems, and evaluate power system performance at lower cost than full-scale hardware system testing, simulated electrical system integration testing using power and energy system components will be conducted.   This lower-cost approach to testing is referred to as Power Hardware In the Loop (PHIL).  PHIL includes development of component computer models that simulate and emulate actual operating machinery components and shipboard power and energy systems.  PHIL testing replaces component models with hardware once hardware development is complete.  PHIL testing costs less than full-scale hardware system testing, shortens development time, and affords the opportunity to identify and mitigate risks in a deliberate fashion from specification development to computer model development to hardware development resulting in a more affordable and robust end product. PHIL testing reduces developmental risk, and demonstrates performance potential prior to live hardware integration testing.Continue to conduct PHIL demonstrations.  In FY 2021 PHIL demonstrations will focus on available propulsion and electrical distribution component prototypes to support design efforts.\n\nAdvanced Power Conversion Module (APCM): Continue to conduct feasibility studies, Cost Based Assessments, and developing performance and technical specifications for next generation compact high power Advanced Power Conversion Module (APCM) incorporating high band gap materials such as silicon carbide. Continue to develop computer component models and system level modeling and simulation efforts. \n\nAdvanced Power Generation Modules (APGM):  Continue to define performance requirements, explore trade space in next generation compact high power Advanced Power Generation Modules (APGM), continue to develop characterization data used to conduct ship design studies and to establish a benchmark for performance comparison, continue to develop a standalone technical description document which describes performance characteristics, continue to evaluate the effect of large pulse loads from future electric weapons on the cycle life of gas turbine engines, and engine capability to respond to such pulse loads without an unacceptable reduction in time between overhaul.   Continue scale generator physical modeling efforts at Sandia National Labs Small Scale Microgrid to determine the feasibility and operational characteristics of dual wound generators operating through active rectifiers to supply a scale medium voltage DC ships electrical bus with scale pulsed, high power weapons and sensors.Continue industry engagement in early trade and concept studies to determine the cost and feasibility of dual wound, variable speed gas turbine generators.

Scope of AEP3 PA was modified in FY19 via amendment 2 to include development and testing of advanced cooling methods and distributed thermal management systems, and to jointly develop advanced control methods, technologies, and hardware for management of advanced shipboard power and energy systems.  Thermal management of shipboard power and energy systems has lagged behind the rapid development of shipboard electrical power systems.  Both nations seek to apply innovative cooling methods derived from academia, industry, and mission systems communities to electric power conversion and distribution.  Advanced controls are required to support the rapid power and energy system reconfiguration needed on future surface ships.  The benefits to both Participants will be the ability to power revolutionary Directed Energy Weapons on existing ships and field future shipboard electrical architectures with performance thresholds that exceed current thermal management and controls limits.\n\nContinue to develop power and propulsion system configurations in support of future surface ship acquisition programs. Develop alternative power and propulsion solutions for future surface combatants and amphibious ships. Continue to improve baseline power system performance by performing analysis, modeling and simulation, life cycle cost analysis, producibility studies, module development, and ship integration studies and planning. Continue to analyze alternatives for supplying power to advanced radars, combat systems, and electric weapons power demands and potential interfaces to develop optimum alternative solutions. Continue assessments of Naval Power and Energy System alternate architectures to best meet emerging ship requirements.  Continue Combat Power and Energy System Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) activities.  Continue to generate strategy, technology development plan and resource requirements for future surface combatant integrated power and energy system.\n\nIssue biennial update of the Naval Power and Energy Systems (NPES) technology development roadmap (TDR)\n\nSupport transition from ONR of Silicon Carbon (and other high bandgap semiconductor materials) based power electronic modules. High band gap semiconductor materials operate at high speeds and temperatures as compared with silicon based materials affording more compact, thermally tolerant power conversion equipment making them highly desirable for naval applications."

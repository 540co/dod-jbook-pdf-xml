J-FFT enables the FT MMC to support: 59 device types; 22 data architectures; 518 user groups; over 146K registered devices; over 5M FFT reports\/day; over 400 distress messages (\"911\") alert reports\/year.  USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD. CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM. USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for Friendly Force Tracking (FFT)."

JFFT development will continue to respond to the growth in FFT device use by enabling the number of device types, data types, and displays supported by the various FFT and HF TTL data architectures. The JFFT Testbed is scheduled to develop and deliver new capabilities including command and control messaging, new FFT and HF TTL data sources and devices, and the ratified NATO message standard for FFT. Also planned is the inclusion of cloud data services at the Impact Level 2 (IL 2) (publicly releasable data), IL 5 (unclassified national security data), and IL 6 (secret), and re-design and implementation of needed upgrades to the Force Tracking Web product, fulfilling requirements for added functionality in data visualization and management. JFFT will continue to exploit, expand and provide mission owners with approved infrastructures at all classification levels that achieve improved performance and reduce costs. JFFT Testbed will remain a key contributor to support North Atlantic Treaty Organization Capability Team activities and other coalition assessments and exercises that advance US and coalition FFT interoperability. \nUSASMDC Space and Missile Defense Center of Excellence (SMDCOE) will execute these funds in FY 2021."

The program integrates, launches, and operates an optimally selected number of DoD-sponsored experiments consistent with Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) priority, opportunity, and funding.   STP missions provide a cost-effective way to flight test new militarily relevant space system technologies, concepts, and designs, providing a way to:  \n \n- Support the acquisition block development approach \n- Demonstrate and develop responsive research and development (R&D) space capabilities \n- Provide early operational capabilities to quickly react to new developments \n- Perform operational risk reduction through direct flight test of prototype components \n- Improve operational design by characterizing the space environment, event, or sensor physics proposed for an operational system\/system upgrade \n- Develop, integrate, test, and acquire advanced payload support hardware for launch vehicles (LV), commercial launch services, and human-rated spaceflight vehicles\n- Expand and leverage international opportunities to further access for the US and its allies' R&D payloads\n \nThe Deputy Secretary of Defense Space Test Program Management & Funding Policy, issued in July 2002, reaffirmed STP as the primary provider of spaceflight for the DoD space research community.  The July 2002 policy statement also reaffirmed STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the International Space Station (ISS). \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified \/classified  enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanism to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new, or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver STP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

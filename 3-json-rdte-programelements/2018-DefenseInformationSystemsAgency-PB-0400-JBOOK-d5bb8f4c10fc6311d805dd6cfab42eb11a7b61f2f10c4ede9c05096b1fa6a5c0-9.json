            "val": "The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defenses (DoD's) consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) (formerly known as National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability\/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:\n\nDISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes engineering for Networking capabilities and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.\n\nPNVC:  The PVNC provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military, satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national\/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   \n \nDoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs."

These new technologies provide protected and assured services for critical support to the warfighter as well as other DoD and federal customers.\n\nElement Management System (EMS):  Provides operational and network operating systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators.  EMS is a component of the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS).\n\nPeripheral and Component Design (Secure Voice Switches):  This equipment satisfies unique military requirements for multi-level security (i.e., extensive conferencing\/conference management capabilities and features, and gateway functions) that are not available in commercial products.  \n\nDoD Mobility: The Mobility Program will lead the development of an Enterprise Solution to support Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and leverage commercial carrier infrastructure to provide entry points for both classified and unclassified wireless capabilities.  Continued evolution and expansion, within the Department, of the DoD Mobility program will allow for increased mobile services in direct support of the warfighter and the COCOMs."

DoD Mobility will evaluate and test the centralized mobility management components for the classified components. Funds will provide support for test and evaluation (T&E) of centralization of the mobile device hardware, software, middleware, and MDM associated capabilities integration efforts.  Will provide for T&E of DoD Mobility NIPRNet & SIPRNet Suite insertion efforts to include mobile VPN and authentication, mobile devices, and mobile applications. Will provide for T&E of mobile devices including prototypes for next generation classified devices and additional commercial mobile devices to test their interoperability across the enterprise. Additionally, funds will support T&E of mobile applications to ensure mobile applications are verified and validated prior to hosting on the MAS. Will support testing of commercial mobile devices and certification and accreditation approval.  Funds will support quarterly testing and evaluation of various Mobile Initiatives; follow up testing against the Mobile Device Management (MDM); verification and validation testing of devices used against the MDM; and requirements testing to ensure Mobility\u2019s requirements have been met.

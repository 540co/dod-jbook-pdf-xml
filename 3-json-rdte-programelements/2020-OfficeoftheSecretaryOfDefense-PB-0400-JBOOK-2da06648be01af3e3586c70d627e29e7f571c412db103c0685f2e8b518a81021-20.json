            "val": "In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the DoD modernization priorities, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program conducts prototype demonstrations and experimentation to address Joint and Combatant Commands\u2019 (CCMDs) warfighting needs within two to four years of the identification of a need.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes to the field for military utility assessment (MUA) enabling scale-up of science and technology from the laboratories into defense acquisition programs.  The objective is to affordably operationalize prototyped technologies that enable warfighters to explore novel concepts and to facilitate informed transition to formal programs of record (PoR).  Based on the results of the MUA, performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are \u201cleft behind\u201d for additional assessments or operational use, transitioned to a PoR, or returned to the technical baseline inventory for further development.  The JCTD program serves as a transition bridge between the USD (R&E) and the USD Acquisition and Sustainment offices. \n\nThe key tenets of the program fulfill national objectives to build a more lethal force, strengthen alliances, and enable the Department of Defense (DoD) to achieve greater performance and affordability.  Following USD(R&E) guidance, the JCTD program seeks to inform new mission capabilities for the Joint Warfighter with a focus on expediting transition timelines to meet critical challenges and operational problems.  Investment for FY 2019 and beyond enables independent demonstrations and operational assessments for emerging cross-cutting technologies, including detection and tracking of hypersonic threats; hardening technology that protects systems against directed energy threats; machine learning tools that increase data processing, exploitation, and data sharing for intelligence analysts; demonstration of improved sensors for persistent wide-area surveillance in a global positioning system-denied environment; and demonstration of improved precision guided munitions that enhances missile defense and restricts enemy movements in the multi-domain environment.  JCTD outcomes accelerate technology transition by rapidly evaluating technology risk, reliability, interoperability, cyber security, and manufacturing processes.  Evaluating prototyped technologies in a relevant operational environment informs acquisition pathways and major acquisition program decisions prior to milestone A or B approvals.\n\nThe JCTD program achieves its objectives by engaging the Military Services, interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the DoD's access to prototyping and innovation.  JCTDs serve as a vehicle for CCMDs to address Joint Force strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment.  JCTDs often address technology needs that fall into the seams between the Military Services and DoD Agencies.  JCTD investments are informed by the CCMDs\u2019 integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessment provided by the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps.\n\nIn FY 2018, the JCTD program successfully completed three MUAs and transitioned three JCTD prototypes.  Two JCTDs transitioned all or select components to new or existing PoRs, and one operational prototype was directly fielded and is being sustained by non-JCTD funds in theater operations. \n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:\nA successful JCTD will transition capability for operational use.  The historical transition rate for the JCTD program is 85 percent,  including: 64 prototypes (55 percent) transitioning to a PoR; 31 prototypes (26 percent) providing \u201cleave-behind\u201d assets for operational fielding; and five prototypes (four percent) placed on the General Services Administration schedule.  The remaining 17 prototypes (15 percent) were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations while rapidly accelerating game changing technologies\/capabilities."

Agility is achieved through a smaller footprint, commercial off-the-shelf components, and quick reaction of theater-based repair assets (e.g., pre-packaged, pre-positioned).  The intent of PIER is to assure continued logistics resiliency and freedom for U.S. Forces to maneuver and conduct agile strategic sealift and logistics.

Using low probability of intercept\/low probability of detection technology, the Under C-WOLF JCTD accomplished this by exploiting the air-water-interface (AWI) OCOMMS system and the all-through-water (ATW) OCOMMS system to operate at tactically useful bandwidths, depths, and ranges.  The bandwidth for the AWI OCOMMS system provides real-time command and control capability to the submarine.  The bandwidth for the ATW OCOMMS system allows an unmanned underwater vehicle to provide results of extensive surveys to a submarine.  Both systems together increase operational effectiveness of underwater communications in a radio frequency denied, degraded, or contested area, particularly in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and U.S. European Command areas of responsibility.  In FY 2018, Under C-WOLF began maturing the AWI and ATW systems.  Commenced testing and laboratory demonstrations."

The three programs are (1) CCMD direct liaison support, (2) JCTD pre-transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD direct liaison support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project identification, demonstration venues, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling them to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD pre-transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD demonstration phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD pre-transition funds may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  Executes a select number of highly classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance."

ET investments are small (average less than $0.500M), short (less than one year) efforts that may lead to a JCTD prototype, depending on the final assessment and determination of technical maturity.  Examples of ETs funding in FY 2018 include:  1) The Autonomous Mission Package Planning and Execution (AMPPE) ET, a risk reduction effort for a set of autonomy-focused JCTDs.  AMPPE demonstrated a baseline system with the ability to mission plan and conduct distributed cognitive networked electronic warfare and intel-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR) missions using multiple unmanned aerial systems.  This set a foundation for the Brilliant Effects Employment Shadow (BEES), Low-Cost Cruise Missile (LCCM) and Resilient Autonomy JCTDs.  2) Scanning Infrared Sensor for Unmanned Air Vehicle Detection and Tracking (SISUDT), a prototype fixed-site, multi-sensor counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) to detect, track, and identify group one and two UASs near forward operating bases.  One SISUDT prototype was deployed in support of OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE for an in-theater validation of infrared UAS detection.  As a result, the U.S. Air Force funded the operation of two SISUDT prototypes in theater.  3) IMEA (acronym is classified): Matured and manufactured a new unmanned aerial system airframe to address significant Warfighting gaps (details are classified).  Began a risk reduction effort to ensure manufacturing standards and requirements are in place for the initial airframe prototype."

The existing PoR can acquire, further mature, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.\n-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing PoR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the capabilities development document (CDD) or capabilities production document (CPD)) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.\n-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  \n- The Results of JCTD can be used to inform research and engineering, or validate a joint requirement per the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System.  This includes identification of the need through development of an initial capability description (ICD) document or accelerating the development of a CDD or CPD to establish a new PoR.\n- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products are listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability."

The JCTD program continues to assess transition.  In FY 2018, 100 percent of completed prototypes successfully transitioned and exceeded the DoD strategic performance goal of 40 percent.  Two of three completed prototypes transitioned all or select capabilities or components to a new or existing PoR.  One operational prototype was directly fielded and is being sustained by non-JCTD funds in theater operations."

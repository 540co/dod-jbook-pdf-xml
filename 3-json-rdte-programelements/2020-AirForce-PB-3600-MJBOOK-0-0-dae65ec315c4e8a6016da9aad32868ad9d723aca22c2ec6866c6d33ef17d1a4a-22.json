Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized. In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (for example, radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems. For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense satellites. In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention."

Continue on-orbit demonstrations of multiple formation flying satellites for near autonomous formation control.  Leverage opportunities to fly demonstrations and prototypes, where successes can identify quick transition to next generation technology needs.  Coordinate a manifest timeline for critical space projects prioritizing Air Force Space Command technical, security, and operational development requirements.  Utilize the Long Duration Propulsive Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adaptor launch schedule and other prospects to quickly fly demonstrations and prototypes.  Mature payloads from concept proposal to leverage commercial Low Earth orbit constellations.  Milestones for these efforts are a Systems Requirements Review and a Preliminary Design Review. Deliverables will be a preliminary system design package and a system interface document."

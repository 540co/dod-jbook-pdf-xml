                                                "val": "- Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate, formally Capability Package Directorate, underwent a name change to better reflect its mission to not only deliver systems and capabilities but also assist in the analysis of future system of systems architecture.  Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate remains the Army?s System of Systems Integration Team responsible for planning, managing, executing, and supporting the design, integration, interoperability, issuing, and technical assessment of the diverse systems and capabilities that are part of the Army?s modernized network. Over the past fiscal year Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate has collaborated with several Program Executive Offices and 14 Program Managers. Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate takes their systems, aligns and validates them based on the Army?s priority of standing up a communication network that is robust and resistant to vulnerabilities. This was accomplished through modernization efforts during Joint Warfighter Assessment 18.1 (JWA 18.1).  JWA 18.1 utilized new and recurring exercises in Germany to provide the required assessment environments.  European Command?s Blue Flag 18 was combined with Joint Modernization Command?s multi-national command post exercise at Grafenwoehr, Germany to provide a venue for joint and multi-national system of systems assessment.  Modernization efforts for United States Army Brigades were conducted at the Combined Arms Training Center, Hornfels, Germany, in conjunction with 2\/1 ID?s Combined Resolve X.  The year-long planning and preparation for JWA 18.1 culminated with field operations in May 18.  Although field operations for Network Integration Evaluation 18.2 were conducted by 3\/82 ABN at Fort Bliss in October 18, Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate executed numerous events to facilitate network planning and design, execute platform design and physically integration, ensure system integration and interoperability, and issue required equipment at Fort Bragg, North Carolina during Fiscal Year 18.  \n\n- Moving modernization forward depends on a holistic approach to the interoperability of necessary systems and equipment. Over the year, Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate?s platform integration of fleets added up to approximately 1,200 hours of work to design and integrate 27 vehicles derived from 10 unique golden vehicles and prototypes, equipped with some of the most advanced technology, integrated alongside current force equipment, and instrumented to support objective test results.  During each event, on a daily basis Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate must manage approximately 150 Field Service Representatives, Field Service Engineers, Logistic Assistant Representatives, and Direct Support Engineers on servicing approximately 25 trouble tickets a day. The team assisted with the training of more than 1,212 Soldiers. \n\n- The Army Warfighting Assessment 18.1 was the first of its kind, conducted OCONUS and continued to develop, without formal testing constraints, advance solutions to the Army Warfighting Challenges in a Multi-Domain Operation (MDO).  Assessed were 18 concepts and capabilities that included robotics, expeditionary mission command, counter-unmanned aerial systems, Command Post Computing Environment, and autonomous vehicle operations.  Future force development priorities included Joint and Multinational interoperability and integration. For Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate, this meant hundreds of systems were loaded, established and validated. Multinational partners came together from Austria, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, France and Germany. \n\n- Network Integration Evaluation 18.2 was assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82st Airborne Division.   As the NIE mission was new to 82 ABN, soldiers and unit leadership once again faced a steep learning curve.  This was the second time the Fort Bliss team took the, ?show on the road? traveling to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to work offsite and complete the various phases vital to the execution of events at Fort Bliss.  In addition to the offsite work challenges, work was also complicated by the arrival of Hurricane Florence during the NIE validation exercise. MEAD conducted Platform Integration, where engineers configure the vehicles with radio and test equipment, the Golden Vehicle Build, where prototype vehicles are built and used to replicate the fleet of vehicles for the exercise, and the Validation Exercises that ensure the equipment is integrated and working properly offsite. For Mission Engineering and Assessment Directorate, this meant 380 systems were loaded, 18 threads were validated, and 217 trouble tickets were resolved."

The JWA is used to assess interim solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges. The JWA concept maximizes collective resources to advance joint and multinational interoperability, future force development, and unit training readiness priorities. Concepts and capabilities are embedded in a live, virtual, and constructive Multinational Division (MND) exercise that is representative of current and future operational environments. The JWA provides a unique opportunity to increase innovation, improve interoperability, and enhance unit readiness. JWA offers the triple pay-off with future force development, training readiness, and Joint \/ Multinational interoperability assessment opportunities. These funds support the following major efforts associated with an assessment:\n\n- Planning: Coordination with multiple stakeholders on the participation and resourcing of personnel, services, equipment and prototypes, and other deliverables needed for risk reduction events, capability and platform integration, training, field support and logistics, event battle rhythm\/schedule, and developing network data products.\n- Preparation: Conduct risk reduction, complete system integrated designs and builds, build prototype vehicles for safety release, conduct system installation and checkout, validate the network, and obtain Information Assurance certifications. A key preparation task is the full scale live network validation event, which includes Cyber Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment of the network. This ensures the technical architecture and security procedures are place to support an exercise of this scale and complexity. Additionally, preparation efforts will supports new system user training.\n- Execution: Technical and logistics support during soldier-led assessments, trouble ticket management and closeout, and field support management.\n- Close-out: Inventorying platforms\/systems, de-installing equipment, returning platforms to their original configurations. All unit equipment will be returned to original configuration following the exercise to ensure unit is fully prepared to execute wartime mission. The final close out task is conduct of After Action Review (AAR) and capture of lessons learned both for systems and architecture, as well as process and procedures for support exercises. \n\nThese funds may also be used for procuring limited equipment and materials (to include prototypes, when required), event infrastructure, field services, personnel support (government and contractor), and travel. These funds may also support similar activities for smaller assessment events leading up to the Joint Warfighter Assessment. Additionally, these funds will support initial planning for the Joint Warfighter 21, scheduled to support US Pacific Command and US Army Pacific. Planning events may occur at home station or require travel to support unit locations. Planning activities will include things such as concept and capability solicitation, initial architecture considerations, and logistics planning."

Conducted performance analysis and documented critical capability deliveries, integration timelines, operational assessments, and fielding plans enabling a rapid fielding of Phase I capabilities in Europe in January 2019.\n\n- Creatively developed a new approach from the ground-up to document a new series of Army End-to-End (E2E) Architecture products.  Approach took on issues in research, data gathering, information consolidation, and standardized simple-but-effective diagramming techniques. A series of architecture products documented the logical network structure, down to the individual router \/ switch \/ firewall \/ network device, of the entire Army network.  Networks include individual soldiers at the tactical level up to the enterprise network edges owned by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and the many Army-specific Multi-protocol Label Switching networks.  Completed products included an E2E Baseline Architecture, E2E PACOM (Pacific Command) Architecture, and E2E EUCOM (European Command) Architecture delivered to Army community to support and inform on various Army decisions and acquisitions efforts.\n\n- Executed an analysis that took the holistic Army and DISA networks and identified gaps in security coverage that required an increased Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) presence in for Garrison DCO Platform (GDP) placement.  Analysis required research on cyber operations from both the Cyber Center of Excellence and the Cyber Protection Brigade to understand stakeholder concepts of employment in cyberspace.  Results informed on the quantity of GDP acquisitions, potentially saving the Army millions of dollars.  Additionally, the outcome provided the DCO community at the O6 and GO (General Officer) level with a new and unique perspective with the OCSE subject matter expertise to make better informed decisions.\n\n- Conducted a series of quick turn-around analysis that informed ASA(ALT) on the feasibility of new systems (Move-Out Jump Off (MOJO), Architecture, Integration, Design and Engineering (AIDE), Windows Tactical Assault Kit (WINTAK)\/Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK), Threat System Management (TSM), Handheld Link 16 (HHL16)) to meet existing Army capability gaps.  Analysis included independent research on each system and their subject matter experts, requirements breakdown within the gaps being addressed, integration, and finally potential overlap with existing and future Program of Record systems.  Results identified key pros and cons with each technology and informed up to the GO level. \n\n- Conducted an analysis exploring employment of Model Based System Engineering into RCO\/OCSE processes to aid in developing new systems.  Completed a model that lays the foundation for application of future RCO and OCSE work, specifically in the areas of electronic warfare and precision fires, providing a more thorough, disciplined, and engineering process-oriented approach for RCO\/OCSE.   Completed its pilot developing a plugin used to analyze potential single modes of failure in system of system data flows.  This Electronic Warfare (EW) plugin correlates threads against configurable unavailable spectrum ranges (possibly blocked due to EW) and identifies nodes that don?t have alternative means of communications in such conditions.

Technologies will be demonstrated in relevant environments, performing tactical\/operational scenarios. Efforts will focus on high-priority, threat-based projects with the intent to deliver an operationally effective capability within one to five years. Efforts will include accelerated material development and competitive prototyping based on anticipated and emerging threats and opportunities. This Project provides the Army an improved mechanism to effectively confront emerging threats and advance America's military dominance. Efforts include development, acquisition, assessment, maturation, and transition of prototype technologies to acquisition programs in Cyber; Electronic Warfare (EW); Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Survivability and other high priority emerging threats and opportunities. Funds may also allow for acceleration of critical Program of Record capabilities to counter urgent and emerging threats. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.\n\nThe Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders' needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.\n\nThe RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and\/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.   \n\nThe RCO capabilities focus areas are:\nCyber\nElectronic Warfare (EW)\nPosition, Navigation and Timing (PNT)\nSurvivability\nOperational Needs Statements (ONS)\nAny other operational needs that become a priority as designated by the Army Board of Directors (BOD)"

This is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) adapting COTS\/GOTS\/NDI equipment to meet operational needs and 2) developing emerging deployable capability through research and development organizations, academia, and industry. The RCO uses streamlined acquisition methods, processes and techniques to rapidly acquire capability; these methods vary by project. The Rapid Capabilities Office will have a dedicated contracting staff, with the flexibility to use both traditional and non-traditional contracting approaches. To reach non-traditional vendors, RCO will use non-standard contracting methods, such as Other Transaction Authority instruments. Where practicable, prototypes will be acquired using competitive procedures. Projects will be transitioned to an approved acquisition program for production and sustainment. Operational assessments will be conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation, prototype maturation, and future capability development."

The GPS III Follow-On satellites will maintain the same capabilities as the GPS III satellites, but will also deliver significant enhancements to include: backward compatibility, Unified S-Band (USB) interface compliance, integration of hosted payloads (redesigned Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS), Laser Retro-reflector Arrays (LRAs), Search and Rescue\/GPS (SAR\/GPS), Energetic Charged Particles (ECP) sensor), and Regional Military Protection (RMP) capabilities that provide the ability to deliver high-power regional M-Code signals in specific areas of intended effect.  Implementation of RMP into the GPS Enterprise will require integration with the ground and user segments, executed by the Global Positioning System Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) and Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) programs, respectively.  \n\nThis PE includes Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) funding.  SMI focuses on space vehicle affordability, capability and addresses future requirements and resiliency needs. The Air Force is using its research laboratories to mature mission related capabilities, technologies (advanced clocks, amplifiers, crosslinks, etc.), and inform future PNT architectures.\n\nThis PE funds the research, development, test and evaluation of GPS III SV11-12 (to include non-recurring engineering support efforts).  This activity includes risk-reducing simulators and systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS III Follow-On.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis PE may include necessary civilian Pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS III Space Segment weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

During this time, the MDA approved the second phase of the two-phased GPS III Follow-On acquisition strategy. Executed using funds in PE 1203265F, GPS III Space Segment, the Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessments conducted during FY2016-2017 provided data and insight into contractors' GPS satellite production designs with emphasis on a mature navigation payload and production-ready designs.  Phase 1 results affirmed the viability of a competitive approach for Phase 2.  The Phase 2 strategy directs the Air Force to conduct a full-and-open competition for GPS III Follow-On space vehicles and specifies the use of RDT&E funds to deliver SV11-12 and conduct associated non-recurring engineering (NRE). In addition to SV11-12, the RDT&E effort will be comprised of developing risk reducing simulators, support test equipment, and conducting the systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS III Follow-On."

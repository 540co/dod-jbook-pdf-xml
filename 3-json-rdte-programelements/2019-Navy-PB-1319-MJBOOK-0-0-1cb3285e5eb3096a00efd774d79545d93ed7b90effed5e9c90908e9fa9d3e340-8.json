They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.\n\nThe Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO\/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats.  The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area.  This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies.  Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept.  \n\nThe objectives reported in prior years under this R-2 Activity have been consolidated into the current objectives described below.\n\nThe current objectives are:\n\n- EW RF Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive\/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. \n\n- EW EO\/IR Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO\/IR) spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming\/steering, and signal processing and transmission. \n\n- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack.\n\n- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies: Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements.\n\n- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command & Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.\n\n- Starting in FY 2018, all Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and Leap Ahead Technology (LA-Tech) investments in Electromagnetic Maneuver Command & Control (EMC2) Warfare will be shown in the new INP PE 0602792N Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research to better convey exactly what the Office of Naval Research is working on in this area.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. \n\nThis activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems.

The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through commercial off the shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.\n\nThe current specific objectives are:\n\na) High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.\n\nb) Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.\n\nc) Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

Each PE Activity has unique goals and metrics, some of which include classified quantitative measurements.  Overall metric goals are focused on achieving sufficient improvement in component or system capability such that the 6.2 applied research projects meet the need of, or produce a demand for, inclusion in advanced technology that may lead to incorporation into acquisition programs or industry products available to acquisition programs.\n\nSpecific examples of metrics under this PE include:\n\n- Provide a secure, over the horizon, on-the- move capability to communicate with higher headquarters at a data rate of 256-512 Kbps at a cost of $75,000.\n- Provide an array configuration suitable for installation on aircraft that will support Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) data rates of 10.7 and 45 Mbps at greater than 150 nautical mile range.\n- Develop prototype Ku band phased array apertures in a form factor suitable for installation on the CVN-78."

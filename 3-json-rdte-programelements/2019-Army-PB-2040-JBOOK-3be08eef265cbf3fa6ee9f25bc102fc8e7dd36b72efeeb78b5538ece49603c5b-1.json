            "val": "This Program Element (PE) funds advanced development of medical materiel within the System Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production portions of the acquisition life cycle using 6.5 (System Development and Demonstration) funding. It supports products successfully developed in the Systems Integration portion of the Systems Development and Demonstration phases through completion of the Milestone C Decision Review. Commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for military use, when available. This PE primarily includes pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials necessary for licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n\nProjects in this PE include the following:\n\nProject 812 funds military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. These funds provide for engineering and manufacturing development of candidate vaccines and drugs to permit large-scale field testing. Development focused on military unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. Products from this project will normally transition to Department of Defense (DoD) Health Programs or Other Procurement, Army (OPA) Funds.\n\nProject 832 funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. Mature COTS medical products are also evaluated for military use. Consideration will also be given to reduce the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel. Products from this project will normally transition to OPA Funds. \n\nProject 849 funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for military relevant infectious diseases. These products fall in four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and insect control measures to limit exposure and disease transmission. FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use. Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA funds. \n\nProject VS8 program receives products that transition from VS7 and funds effort to complete research and development for the medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) Mission Essential Packages (MEPs) to support 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters. The Army's force design increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  \n\nThese Projects are managed by United States (U.S.) Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command."

Specifically funds pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials or mechanical engineering evaluations for effectiveness of devices or biologics (products derived from living organisms) to fulfill unique military requirements. Consideration is also given to reducing the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel.

It funds research that supports conclusive human clinical trials to demonstrate MCM effectiveness  safety  and related manufacturing tests. This work, which is jointly performed by military laboratories, civilian contracted pharmaceutical firms and foreign research partners, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed. Medical products approved for human use must meet the U.S. FDA approval before MCM can be used on Warfighters. Development priority is based upon four major factors: (1) the extent of the disease within the Combatant Commands' theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development, production, and sustainment). Malaria, dysentery, hepatitis , and Dengue diseases (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are found in all Combatant Command areas and are at the top of the infectious diseases risks list."

In 2009, a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs. In 2010, the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation. In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP upgrades and retrofits the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission."

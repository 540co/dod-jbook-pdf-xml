This aligns with the National Defense Strategy's Level of Effort 3:  Reform the Department.  Develop acquisition expertise, innovation tools, and agile contract solutions to more effectively deliver capabilities to the warfighter as urgent operational requirements emerge.  Additionally, there was increased investment in multi-modal CWMD modeling and simulation capabilities integration of new modeling techniques and capabilities with existing programs and models to leverage the best cutting edge technology for improved CWMD modeling and simulation capabilities in support of operational planning and mission requirements to better inform operational decision makers of WMD defeat options and their effects."

Research, development, test, and evaluation to identify, develop, and exploit signatures associated with nuclear threats in support of U.S. capabilities that detect and interdict such threats; and locate, identify, and track special nuclear material and improve detection factors such as range, time, sensitivity, and accuracy to enhance Service and Special Mission Unit capabilities. These efforts support DoD requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.\n\n2.  Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine technical capabilities needed to improve Department of Defense (DoD) contingency planning activities; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; gain knowledge or understanding necessary to improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear.\n\n3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.\n\n4. Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs."

Defeat Technologies develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of WMD, while minimizing collateral effects. Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both. It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation CWMD capabilities. The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials. Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to Budget Activity (BA) 3, Advanced Technology Development (ATD) efforts. On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.\n\n2.  WMD counterforce technologies research develops weapons effects modeling algorithms, full and sub-scale test series required to investigate CWMD weapon effects and sensor performance, and visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation Technical Reachback cell. These activities are critical enablers for the development of advanced CWMD planning tools. Energetics research develops materials and weapon design technology providing defeat capabilities for engaging hard and deeply buried targets that are beyond current high explosive blast\/fragmentation warhead technology. Life sciences research develops technologies to find, locate, mitigate, and defeat WMD using bio-organisms or components."

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities. Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects."

It also offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article\/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management. The project leverages 50 years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD. Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels. This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD."

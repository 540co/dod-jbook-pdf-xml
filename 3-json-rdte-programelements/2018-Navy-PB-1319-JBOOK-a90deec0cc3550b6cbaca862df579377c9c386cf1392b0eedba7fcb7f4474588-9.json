            "val": "International Cooperative RDT&E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.\n\nNaval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  \n\nAssessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.\n\nMid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test & Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.\n\nOperations Integration Group:  Classified\n\nCHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS\/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource\/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.\n\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.\n\nThe Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.\n\nMTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:\n\nThis project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations. Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009). Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States). This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with \"Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations\" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.\n\nThe MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations. This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats.\n\nThis project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:\n\n(1) Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.\n(2) Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.\n(3) Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.\n(4) Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.\n(5) Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.\n(6) Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.\n(7) Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations."

In addition, it develops coherent approaches in coordination with combatant commanders (COCOMs), and appropriate partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership Initiative.\n\nThe project scope supports the strategic shift to the Pacific Region with emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Coalition Interoperability.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and Coalition Interoperability requirements. \n\nOngoing cooperative RDT&E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US\/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:\n1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;\n2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;\n3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);\n4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). \n5. Represent the US Navy in Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed Armaments Cooperation Forums, including the Conference of NATO Armaments Directors' groups {NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG)}, and Senior National Representative-Maritime (SNR-M);\n6.  Funding of various international RDT&E support databases including Technical Project Officer (TPO), International Agreement Generators, Information\/Data Exchange Agreements, and Project Agreements\/Memorandums of Understanding;\n7.  Leading the Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP)."

                            "val": "The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect warfighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Warfare); warfare systems (Expeditionary Warfare & Combat Logistics, Sea Control, and Power Projection) and analytical underpinnings\/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core \"organize, train, and equip mission\" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21\" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both warfighting and warfighting-support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, this project also includes funding for Concept Formulation (CONFORM)  \/ Concept Development and Experimentation (CDE) efforts.  This is a shift of funding from PE 0605152N, Studies and Analysis Support, Project 2092, Naval Warfare Studies.  CONFORM\/CDE for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Commands (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  \n-\tThe majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.\n-\tThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.\n-\tOutputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.\nCapabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)\/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and interoperability gaps of both current and future Navy platforms and systems capabilities."

Efforts provide added analytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and support warfare integration initiatives. \n\n-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics, capabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material. METRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling\/methodology to support analysis. Models\/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints. \n\n-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not limited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of large-scale architecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine ability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category Program Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research performance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned systems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations and uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results. \n\n-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy that work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model\/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21 to include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.\n\n-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or support capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in warfighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems and technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program planning to determine the warfighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities. Determine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy. \n\n-World Class Modeling, Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements process that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support analyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation plans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.\nThe May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a CBA to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy."

Assessment teams will normally consist of a mission analyst and four infrastructure analysts, but team composition may be modified based on the site and assessment requirements. The assessments include pre-site work, on-site work, and post-site report writing. The final assessment report will include collected research such as Baseline Elements of Information (BEI), Benchmarks and Standards, characterizing infrastructure \/ identifying vulnerabilities to missions, and completing the vulnerability portion of the Risk Decision Package. A40 will work with other service and agency teams to supplement data evaluation for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) offices as negotiated between OASD HD's MA Director, the Joint Staff J34 and Service CIP offices"

This support may include infrastructure research and subject matter expertise (SME) analysis, participation in DoD or interagency working groups, and infrastructure-related inquiries by congress. They will identify emerging threat vectors and CIP-related gaps in coordination with CCMDs and DoD agencies related to MA and Critical Infrastructure Sectors, and their impacts via white papers and briefings. U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) submissions and on-site liaisons provided per request and approval; participation in USNORTHCOM outreach sessions is anticipated as part of this tasking."

Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with \"Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations\" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.\n\nThe MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. \n\nThis project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:\n\n(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.\n(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.\n(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.\n(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.\n(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.\n(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.\n(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.\n\nStarting in FY17, funding for MTMD is realigned from Program Element 0603582N Combat System Integration."

CDEP will prepare for and conduct hardware-in-the-loop tests and provide assessments and recommendations to improve information exchanges required to conduct at-sea demonstrations or to evaluate performance as an effective and efficient alternative to costly at-sea demonstrations. \n\n(4) Open Architecture will begin developing Force Level Function (FLF) component interfaces based on the Force Level data model. The OAWG will collaborate with BMC4I to ensure these interfaces align with the Target Architecture as well as selected Possible Point Solutions (PPS) in developing the Force Level Open Architecture Technical Standard (FLOATS). \n\n(5) TPEX will continue preparations for MTMD participation as part of ongoing at-sea test event continuums, Formidable Shield 17 executive will occur at the beginning of FY18. At-Sea Demonstrations will include live tracking events and a combination of live and simulated engagements. Integrated Air Defense and Ballistic Missile Defense test scenarios will be conducted among the nations with a fleet exercise focus. Planning for At-Sea Demonstrations and follow-on at-sea testing will continue into future years and include target configuration\/procurement. Focus in FY18 will include potential At Sea Demonstration preparations notionally in 2020 and 2025.\n\n(6) Operational Requirements group will continue to provide fleet inputs and operator oversight to test and evaluation events. The Operational Concept Document will be updated as will final tactics, techniques and procedures in support of ongoing at-sea demonstrations."

This PE directly supports the China Strategic Initiative's (CSI) Strategic Emulations LOE, expanding those outputs to the operational level, making insights timely and relevant to USPACOM (and other Combatant Commands), Functional Component Force Commanders across all strategic domains (e.g. cyber, air and space, sea etc.) in support of national-level mandated operational and strategic-level contingency planning.  \n\nOperational Decision Analysis (ODA). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on ODA sub Line of Effort support effort with at least 80% of initial objectives being achieved by 3QTR FY18.\n\nThis PE provides funding to support continuing requirement for studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). The PE directly support CSI's Strategic Emulation LOE and will provide critical technical inputs and strategic insights that complement the program's OE output database, which is still under development. ODA outputs will significantly enhance Combatant Component Command staffs with their operational and intelligence planning and global synchronization across multiple domains amongst all geographic and functional combatant commands.  \n\nDecision Support Elements to Operational Emulation Modeling and Simulation (DSEOMS). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on this major LOE with at least 80% of initial objectives being met by 3QTR FY19.\n\nThis PE provides funding to support all four major LOEs for the CSI program?and all its sub-LOEs. This effort will provide a comprehensive and campaign-quality decision support toolset to decision makers across the entire CSI enterprise: OSD, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Intelligence Community, and the Whole of US Government (Interagency). This PE will create a set of enhanced automated and doctrinal decision- making tools to assist key policy- and strategic leaders on a full spectrum of contingencies related to competitor nations. DSEOMS will provide analytic modeling and simulation tools that take inputs from all major CSI program LOEs; the goal being to present decision- and policy-makers and their planning staffs with a rich dataset of information that is relevant, timely, and substantive for their respective problem sets. The current scope and focus across all LOE's is to support emerging near-term and longer-term planning to both significantly enhance war planning orientation and force posture considerations but also to significantly enhance more informed strategic choices regarding future joint\/service capability investments and joint\/service operational concepts across all strategic domains.   Ultimately, fully integrated program deliverables will guide a deliberative process for identifying efficiencies in major service platform decisions to ensure they are optimized for the full-spectrum of projected adversary capabilities in the future."

Those issue areas included; Trust, Supply Chain, Organic (DoD) Capability Sustainment, and Technology Development.  \n\nIntense global competition in the Printed Circuit Board (PrCB) industry has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of United States PrCB companies, leaving the domestic PrCB industrial base \"fragile\" and progressively declining in capability and health.  Implementation of the strategies developed by the EA for PrCB Technologies will proactively ensure that the U.S. PrCB industry is capable of supporting future DoD electronics requirements.  The strategic plan is expected to indentify technology gaps and research and development needs, as well as identify and recommend policy changes.\n\nIn addition to benefiting DoD by ensuring access to leading edge PrCB technology, it is expected that the EA program will help the struggling domestic PrCB industry by indentifying future technology research and development needs and securing the domestic military market."

            "val": "Full-scale Aerial Targets assure warfighters' weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production. Targets are used to validate operational missile\/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental\/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, BQM-167A Subscale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized Target Payload Subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve aerial targets and target control capabilities to meet current and future threats. Air Force is the Executive Agent for full scale aerial targets.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Aerial Targets weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a reusable jet-powered target aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. \n\nElectronic Attack (EA) payload upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales and full-scales to realistically emulate current and emerging foreign threat systems in support of weapons testing.  \n\nTCS provides a myriad of sub-systems that, together, deliver the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full-scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, and the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service test and evaluation (T&E) demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems."

Targets are used to validate operational missile\/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental\/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15 aircraft, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD."

Targets are used to validate operational missile\/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental\/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15 and other aircraft.  Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target, and updates of Target Control Systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD."

They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the Naval Research and Development Framework in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains. The portfolio of technologies advanced in the PE span the full breadth of research supporting the Navy and Marine Corp mission.\n\nTechnology development activities include projects and programs to support numerous high priority Advanced Technology Development opportunities and Navy and Marine Corp needs. These efforts include research supporting on-demand battlespace shaping through advanced undersea weapons; technologies to support a standoff or remote capability for detection and location, diagnosis, render safe, neutralization and enhanced access; efforts that seek to capitalize on recent technology breakthroughs to develop and integrate components including subsystems into prototypes quickly: efforts to provide operational analysis through studies, analyses, gaming and experimentation to identify Navy and Marine Corps capability needs that can be addressed with S&T solutions; exploration of high-risk, disruptive, and innovative technologies and concepts to provide a venue to develop innovative technologies that are targeted towards advancing the capabilities of naval warfighters; investments that provide rapid response Science and Technology (S&T) solutions to immediate Fleet\/Force needs identified by individual warfighters at the deckplate level; specific electronic and electromagnetic systems research to improve weapons systems and data fusion technology; research to reduce and eliminate the incidence of noise reduced hearing loss; technologies for enhanced capability of Naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost; programs to develop, test, and demonstrate advanced communications, electronic attack (EA), electronic surveillance (ES), electronic warfare (EW), and radar functions; develop and demonstrate technologies that enable the development of affordable, effective and robust Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities using either GPS systems, non-GPS navigation devices, or atomic clocks; efforts that support the development of technologies associated with various naval platforms (surface, subsurface and terrestrial) and the protection of those platforms; and protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects in research supported by the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The performance of the work funded in this PE is reviewed at several levels to ensure that the investment is relevant and productive. At the macroscopic level, investments are often coordinated with a variety of organizations, examples of which include the Navy Warfare Development Command, Commander, Fleet Forces Command, resource sponsors, program offices, etc. to address the goals, objectives and needs identified by the warfighters. At the microscopic level, the work funded in this PE is reviewed periodically by the Program Manager to ensure the investment is meeting the goals defined for each project. This review includes feedback collected from the warfighter community on all sea trials and Limited Objective Experiments to support the Program Manager's assessment of the value and relevance of each investment. Furthermore, the entire program is reviewed yearly by the Chief of Naval Research."

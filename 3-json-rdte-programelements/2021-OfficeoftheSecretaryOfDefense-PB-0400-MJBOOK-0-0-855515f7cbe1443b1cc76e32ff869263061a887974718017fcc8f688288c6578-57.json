The newly established OUSD(A&S) Chief Information Security Office (CISO) was created to improve planning, coordination, synchronization, and integration of cyber activities and increase DoD wide emphasis on reducing the cyber risk to critical DoD missions and enhancing DIB Cyber Security.\n\nFunds provide technical, systems engineering, trend analysis, and portfolio management of programs, projects, and activities developing cyber capabilities to maximize the Department's return on investment of cyberspace resources and effect a comprehensive approach for assessing, procuring, and sustaining critical cyber capabilities and cyber resilient systems and platforms from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of weapons systems performance and military\noperations.\n\nAdditionally, these funds will provide systems analyses, portfolio management, and executive support of Senior Cyber Leadership forums, enterprise wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to Cyber capabilities, enhancing cyber resilience within systems and platforms, and enhancing the cybersecurity of the DIB.\n\nResources will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance, cost parameters, and determining and mitigating cyber risks of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to assure capability advantage, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts, minimize cyber related performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex systems, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions, and address cyber security requirements, gaps, and required technical solutions."

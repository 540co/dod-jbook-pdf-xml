SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Missile Defense Systems (MDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts."

SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts."

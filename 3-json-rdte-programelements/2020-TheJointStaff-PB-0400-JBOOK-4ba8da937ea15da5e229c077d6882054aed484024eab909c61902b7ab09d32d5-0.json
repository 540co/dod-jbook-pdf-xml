Employ a deployable assessment capability supporting the collection and analysis of decision quality data for command and control operations from the operational to lowest tactical echelons of command, in field conditions, in real time to   provide immediate feedback on the data being collected. Projects include:\n\nCyber Guard (CG)\/Cyber Flag (CF) - Provide assessment and technical support to cyber exercises to include C2 information systems, while conducting assessments of cyber effects on systems integrated into the DoD Information Network.\n\nTrusted Network Environment - Support cross domain security solution that provides cross domain collaborative services (e-mail with attachments, chat, VoIP, and file share) between US SIPRNET, coalition bi-lateral and multilateral networks that does not compromise respective national networks or domains.\n\nCounter-UAS (CUAS) \u2013 Data collection and analysis during RTD&E test events as well as in support of urgent operational needs in active operational theaters. Analysis covers all aspects of CUAS defense, including lethal engagements. \n\nSmall Unit Situational Awareness \u2013 Support DARPA Squad-X and related efforts to enhance Joint\/Coalition small unit situational awareness and lethality with quantitative\/qualitative field assessments.  Efforts include assessments of GPS-denied navigation aids, unmanned systems performance, command of kinetic\/non-kinetic engagements, and employment of expert systems\/artificial intelligence systems at small unit level.\n\nBold Quest (BQ) 2020 Coalition Interoperability Demonstrations \u2013 Support the design, plan, and execution of the BQ events which address close air support, Mission Partner Environment (MPE) \/ Federated Mission Networking (FMN) development\/assessments, counter UAS, IFF testing, and cyber effects on operations for U.S. forces and coalition partners.  Support includes accredited exercise networks, associated C2 systems, and data collection and analysis capabilities. \n\t\nJoint Tactical Integration - Integrate, refine, and accelerate the migration of Special Operating Forces (SOF) battle-proven capabilities to rapidly improve the Joint warfighting capabilities and lethality of general purpose forces in accordance with governing instructions. Capabilities include integrated secure radio networks, tactical data links, tactical cellular, enroute satellite communications, enhanced situational awareness, fratricide prevention, and a more efficient kill-chain.\n\t\nCoalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) - Assess US and coalition systems support in-theater operations by ensuring C5 capabilities adequacy before current operational employment in the Afghan and Iraq areas of operations.  Conduct CIAV projects in the INDOPACOM AOR.  CIAV assessments improve interoperability and joint warfighting capabilities."

Synchronize Service testing, acquisition and fielding of Mode 5 IFF capability, with focus on Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2020. Monitor Service fielding progress of 169 platform types.\n\n3. Due to resource re-phasing, lead the design, planning and execution of two risk reduction sized Bold Quest coalition capability demonstrations and assessments, in order to inform U.S. and partner nation investment in networked capabilities to improve the detection and engagement of targets via surface (ground and maritime) and air delivered fires and other non-kinetic means.\n\n4. Lead the digitally aided close air support (DACAS) coordinated implementation initiative among all US Services, USSOCOM, and 16 partner nations; develop and document engineering change proposals\u2019 technical solutions to operational interoperability issues in the CAS mission area; maintain the associated equipment and currency of assessment tools software and licensing agreements.\n\n5. Lead US and partner nations with international fire support interoperability capability development initiatives, to ensure on-going efforts optimize: unity-of-effort; resource\/cost benefit; and enhanced fire support integration.\n\n6. Expand digital call-for-fire solution development to include enhanced multi-national interoperability with 11 partner nations.\n\n7. Lead, coordinate, organize, and execute an annual Joint Fire Support Symposium to exchange information, identify issues, examine capability shortfalls, assess emerging technologies, and recommend areas for DoD action\/resolution.\n\n8. Conduct accreditation assessments for 18 of 33 current signatory programs (11 Joint Terminal Attack Controller, 2 Forward Air Controller (Airborne), and 5 Joint Fires Observer).\n\n9. Lead development and refinement of four U.S. and NATO joint fires-related doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures publications.\n\n10.

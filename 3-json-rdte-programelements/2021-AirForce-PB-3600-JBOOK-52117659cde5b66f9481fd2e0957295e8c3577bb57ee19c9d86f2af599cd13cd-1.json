Included is development for the Next Generation On-Board Oxygen Generation System, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out), Crash Survivable Recorder (CSR),Controlled Flight Into Terrain - Prevention (CFIT-Prevention), Pilot Training Next (PTN) and associated upgrades. There are currently 443 aircraft in the Air Force inventory. Remaining service life is up to 39 years from the final delivery in May 2010.\n\nThe T-38 program continues studies & development efforts supporting future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address DMSMS issues for the T-38 Platform and regular block upgrades for the T-38C as required to keep the system current. Block upgrades incorporate software and\/or hardware improvements for the aircraft and aircrew training devices to address flight safety issues and to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, or National Airspace System.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Specialized Undergraduate Flight Training capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

PRIME has completed seven Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality. PRIME is a desktop trainer similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators. PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to maintain concurrency and relevancy. Funds will also be used to develop enhancements that increase fidelity and functionality.  \n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources efforts include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. \n\nImplementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver URT weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F."

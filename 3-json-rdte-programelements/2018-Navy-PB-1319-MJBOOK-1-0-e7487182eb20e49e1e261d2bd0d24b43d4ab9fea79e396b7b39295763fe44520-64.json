The MUX efforts will inform a future program of record.\n\nProject 3427 - This project provides for experimentation and support of the CQ-24A Cargo UAS (commonly referred to as KMAX).  CQ-24A will be used to specifically inform the unmanned cargo resupply requirements of future programs of record, to include MUX.  Experimentation includes payloads\/sensor integration, control station integration, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) development. These experimentation efforts inform program capability documents and support other military exercises.\n\nCost estimate for Cost to Complete and Total Cost for both project units are being developed and will be promulgated in a future budget request."

This next generation UAV capability will have far greater range, endurance, altitude, and payload capability than the current conventional VTOL technology can provide from air capable ships.\n\nThis effort will inform program scope and phasing for development of the MUX capability that will be part of a future Program of Record (POR), supporting Expeditionary Force 21 Operating Concepts, as an advanced, multi-mission platform in support of a Marine Expeditionary Force\/Marine Expeditionary Brigade-sized MAGTF and addressing future capability\ngaps."

The other seven acquisition workforce civilian pay program elements are 0605826F Global Power, 0605827 Global Vigilance and Combat Systems, 0605829F Global Cyber, Network, and Business Systems, 0605830F Global Battle Management, 0605831F Capability Integration, 0605832F Advanced Program Technology, and 0605898F Management Headquarters.  \n\nThe Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) equips U.S. and allied forces with operational weapon systems in support of military and national security operations.  The acquisition and product support workforce provides cutting edge weapon systems, sustainment capabilities, and is charged with providing management, tools, and technical and business capabilities needed to oversee acquisition programs throughout their life cycle.  The direct funded acquisition workforce funded in this program element will support all phases of acquisition programs to include material solution analysis, technology development, engineering and manufacturing development, production and deployment, and operations and support.  This funding does not include costs for base operating support civilian personnel.  These program elements support both civilian pay and non-pay support requirements.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

            "val": "The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The LL Program supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of DoD missions. Funding is applied to support high-risk, high-payoff research that provides unique and specialized capabilities to the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The LL P534 Program funds ten technology project areas. Of these, there are five core-technology areas:\n\u2022\tAdvanced Devices\n\u2022\tOptical Systems and Technology\n\u2022\tInformation, Computation and Exploitation\n\u2022\tRadio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology\n\u2022\tCyber Security\nIn addition, there are four emerging-technology initiatives:\n\u2022\tNovel and Engineered Materials\n\u2022\tQuantum System Sciences\n\u2022\tBiomedical Sciences and Technology\n\u2022\tAutonomous Systems\nIn FY 2017, an Integrated Systems initiative has been added. This area focuses on combining novel technologies from Lincoln Laboratory\u2019s research and development efforts (as well as from commercial and academic R&D) with Lincoln Laboratory\u2019s system architecture and system engineering expertise to create breakthrough system-level designs and prototypes. \n\nThe ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all the Department of Defense (DoD) mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. In general, the categories are selected in consultation with ASD(R&E) and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The new initiatives are chosen to address difficult emerging problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with a goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally. \n\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence:\n-  The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&T) awareness and context in order to assist Defense decision-makers plan for an uncertain future.  The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today\u2019s global S&T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW\/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow\u2019s future.  The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies."

The continuing digital charge-coupled device (CCD) imager project constructed and demonstrated two cameras that incorporated the new imager technology fabricated in the Lincoln Laboratory Microelectronics Laboratory (ML). One of the cameras included a novel low-noise readout circuit and the other camera incorporated the hybrid integration of a CCD and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to enable kilohertz readout rates. Development also continued on germanium (Ge) CCD imagers that can offer broadband visible and short-wave infrared imaging, as well as sensitivity for higher-energy x-rays relative to silicon-based detectors. In FY 2016, the germanium CCD fabrication process was transferred to the 200-mm toolset available in the ML and prototype imagers were designed and fabricated. A new advanced-imager project involved the development of pixel-to-pixel crosstalk reduction techniques for compound-semiconductor Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (GmAPD) arrays. These techniques enable the reduction of the pixel pitch to enable GmAPD arrays having larger formats. Work continued on the development of a low size, weight and power (SWaP) optical communications transceiver incorporating silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). During the past year, silicon PICs were characterized and second-generation PICs were designed. A new integrated-photonics project involved the development of high-power, broadband optical sources for interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs). Both the spectral bandwidth and the electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency of these optical sources were improved. Work continued on the development of designs and models to increase the efficiency of quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) operating in the 9-\u03bcm-wavelength region for infrared countermeasures. In the area of advanced electronics, work continued on the development of high-power, microwave diamond transistors for radar, electronic-warfare, and communications applications. The current density of diamond p-MOSFETs was increased 100X by applying a NO2 surface treatment and a growth reactor was installed to enable the in-house growth of diamond materials to accelerate progress on this project. The microhydraulic actuator project was refocused to realize configurations that emulate human muscle and single-layer demonstrations were performed."

The portfolio included novel optical technology developments applicable across a broad range of DoD problems. A Digital Coherent Aperture Combiner was developed that performs adaptive optics in the digital domain to synthesize a much larger aperture receiver to reduce the size and cost of communication ground terminals while improving resistance to signal fading. A Deployable In-Space Coherent Imaging Telescope (DISCIT) was designed with the ability to \u201cunfold\u201d a large optical aperture from a small satellite in order to provide transformational advantages to the DoD. This telescope has the goal of demonstrating a 70 cm telescope with single-fold composite hinges and using target in the loop image compensation to achieve image quality comparable to a full-aperture telescope, as well as addressing multiple hinge technology for scaling to larger (multiple meters) apertures. A novel Micro LADAR system for the use on hand-launched unmanned air vehicle was designed, supporting subsystems were developed, and a prototype system was demonstrated on a testbench. An Undersea Optical Communication testbed was developed that successfully demonstrated high data rate optical communication techniques under water. After four years of funding, the Long-Baseline Interferometer testbed completed its final year by successfully designing, fabricating and integrating a novel spectrometer in order to improve the state-of-the-art in sensitivity and image quality by nearly and order of magnitude. A photo-thermal speckle detection technology was developed that can identify chemicals present in trace amounts at small stand-off distances. Such capability is important in the modern battlefield and for protecting crowd in various venues. The Panelized Laser Transceiver effort started mid-year FY 2016 to develop a new architecture for a scalable phased array laser transmitter and receiver."

Algorithms that use limited on-sensor computation and are rapid enough for real-time feedback were implemented.  A closed loop simulation of high-speed obstacle avoidance with an emulated sensor was demonstrated. The sensor is now being integrated with a micro-camera; (2) Another effort developed, implemented, and tested algorithms for data-driven UAV path planning. This research used an open-source robotics library and a custom node to communicate with a serious gaming engine, which is also used by the Army; (3)  Software libraries to enable intelligent path planning in DRAKE (a collection of tools for analyzing the dynamics of our robots and building control systems for them in MATLAB and C++) were implemented and tested by manipulating dynamic known objects on an industrial robot arm; (4) Interception of at-speed surface ships using newly developed autonomy software performed well in at-sea testing, which validated both the software and the ocean flow models. As an outgrowth, dolphin bio sonar techniques and strategies were investigated for use on an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) platform for mine clearing of bottom and buried mines. This effort completed the real-time autonomous mission simulator tools for biomimetic sonar area search and made progress on the field test setup. The mission simulator was used to establish performance metrics for area clearance; (5) A project that used a multi-stage linear ionization array for silent airborne propulsion was initiated, and progress was made on aerodynamic modeling and propulsion system prototyping. Control of a high-efficiency glider air-frame was designed, fabricated, and flight tested.  Optical imaging of gases to measure acoustic pressure visualized the ionic wind and informed the thruster design; (6) A new research project was begun that developed algorithms for  decentralized coordination for teams of autonomous systems started. Advanced methods to improve performance for large observation spaces were developed and new techniques to account for adversarial opposition were created."

Advances were also made in three-dimensional integration of superconducting qubits and the design of a chip with five coupled qubits. These experimental efforts were supplemented with advances in simulation of correlated noise\/errors to understand its impact on quantum error correction and advances in algorithms for loading large, sparse matrix data into qubits to enable an exponential speedup for an important class of linear algebra algorithms. The FY 2016 quantum communication work included the characterization of a high-rate source and receiver of continuous-variable quantum optical states operating in the ultra-high-bandwidth, low brightness regime. The quantum communication project modified a high-speed secure communication protocol capable of achieving greater than 1-Gbps secure rates over 40-km fiber spans.

The program will identify outreach opportunities to inform and train DoD S&T organizations in the usage of analytical tools and methodologies to support \u201cin-house\u201d decision making and expand organizational knowledge into emerging technology areas of strategic interest.\n- Technical Assessment Program: Will sponsor multiple technical assessment activities that support the community of interest topic areas and more emphasis will be placed on conducting impact assessments of emerging technologies.\n - Intel Support to S&T: Will provide a bridge between the intelligence community (IC) and the S&T community to support development efforts and to produce an annual S&T Intelligence Needs Plan providing the IC a formal understanding of intelligence requirements for the S&T community.\n- Wargaming: Will provide the ability to integrate emerging threats from kill chain analysis and potentially disruptive technologies from horizon scanning efforts to the DoD Wargaming community for the improved development of realistic threats in future scenarios and the inclusion of AT&L equities in the wargaming community."

Innovation is the rapid experimentation and development of existing technologies (hardware, software, licenses, databases, analytics, etc.) to create new capabilities and demonstrate their intelligence value in support of warfighter operations.\n\nICI also funds Project Maven a rapid fielding Artificial Intelligence (AI) program to augment and automate Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED)  for full motion video Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude, High Altitude, and Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) ISR platforms in support of defeat-ISIS and National Defense Strategy (NDS) peer\/near peer competitor strategy. Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation.   Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within Full Motion Video (FMV) images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from GEOINT. Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).  The MAVEN funding will move to the newly created Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team, Program Element (PE) 0307588D8Z beginning in FY 2020."

This effort initially focused on addressing DoD unmanned aircraft system (UAS) integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and a demonstration of a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards. While UAS initially were the primary focus, interoperability among all unmanned and manned systems is the long-term goal."

The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as  operations\/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood, Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system will provide a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution.\n \nThis joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems."

Developed and validated separation minima that enabled low-altitude military UA to remain well clear of other aircraft.  Identified and addressed key capability gaps for broad-spectrum military UAS operations at low altitudes.  Through the SARP, coordinated with and leverage the resources of the FAA, NASA and DHS to work common integration challenges. Investigated and identified best-candidate solutions for low size, weight, power and cost approaches supporting military small UAS (sUAS) operations in national, international and foreign national airspace. Finalized and reported recommended criteria and methods to quantify the contribution of the UAS pilot performance of the SAA function to overall airspace safety. Engaged with FAA to discuss concepts, architectures, functional requirements as well as policy and procedural issues regarding UAS Spectrum, Communications, Command and Control and other infrastructure that was enhanced, improved or replaced in order to facilitate DoD UAS integration into the NAS. Collaborated to develop and implemented operating systems in the NAS that support UAS integration, such as GBSAA. Identified specific use cases of current operations and identified the gaps\/deltas between current UAS operations in the NAS under a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) and UAS operating as fully integrated into the NAS.  Identified specific scenarios for research, implementation, and testing. Identified operational use cases for research, development, and testing, and provided semantic decision support, and modeling and simulation."

The combined C2 capability demonstrated a Navy Common Control Station (CCS) and Air Force Common Mission Command Center (CMCC) working together and sharing mission and telemetry data using UAS Control Segment Architecture (UCS) interfaces. \n  \nDeveloped a Joint Communication Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JCAUS) which aims to establish a Government and Industry framework for unmanned systems communications. The architecture aligns with modular open systems architecture principles and allows PoRs to encourage competitive business environments and to react to emerging and urgent communication requirements faster by providing a framework for rapid technology insertions. \n\nEstablished an MOA between Navy and Army Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) PoRs to assess their Joint Architecture Unmanned System (JAUS) based test tools to develop a plan that will combine and standardize the tools sets.\n\nSponsored an Unmanned Systems Interoperability and Integration workshop\/technical exchange that focused on the integration aspects of unmanned systems, rather than the technology of the systems themselves.  Focus areas were Unmanned Systems Integration with Platforms (integration of UxS to Aircraft, Ships, Ground Vehicles); with other Systems (integration of payloads, weapons, sensors); with Humans (operator interaction, human-robot interface, controllers, trust issues, training etc.) and Integration with the Force\/Fleet (mission integration).\n\nAssessed the Unmanned Systems Safety Guidance Document, publish in 2007, for technology advancement gaps due to the evolution of autonomous technology and unmanned systems. The identified gaps were categorized as \u201ccritical\u201d, \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cother\u201d.   The six critical gaps resulted largely from the evolution of unmanned systems into more autonomous and learning systems, increased weaponization of the systems, easier access to such systems by all nations and even non-nation actors, and the increasingly robotic (or mobile) nature of unmanned systems."

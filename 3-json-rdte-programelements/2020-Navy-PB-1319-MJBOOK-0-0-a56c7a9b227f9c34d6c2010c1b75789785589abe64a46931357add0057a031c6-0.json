Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP)  supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramp up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by speeding up scientific programs, by cross-fertilization of ideas, by hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and by training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD.

Example metrics include extending the life of Thermal Barrier Coatings for transition to the Enterprise and Platform Enablers Future Naval Capability program. It is projected that the life time of Thermal Barrier Coating on Turbine Blades can be doubled. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively."

Outstanding young PECASE scientists and engineers were be funded to address shared Naval R&D priorities.  These research objectives include improving human-machine interfaces, increasing the flexibility and reach of the naval force through the incorporation of autonomous systems, enabling maneuverability, efficiency and resiliency for sustained operations, transforming vast data into timely knowledge; and enabling offensive and defensive actions that are multi-domain, integrated, and cost-effective."

Navy's efforts to support multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enable the U.S. Navy to maintain its technological superiority.  Through this increase, additional Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) awards, and Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) will be selected and funded.  These new MURI topics draw from the most critical Naval R&D priorities to translate future force attributes into research objectives.   Outstanding young PECASE scientists and engineers were be funded to address shared Naval R&D priorities.  These research objectives include improving human-machine interfaces, increasing the flexibility and reach of the naval force through the incorporation of autonomous systems, enabling maneuverability, efficiency and resiliency for sustained operations, transforming vast data into timely knowledge; and enabling offensive and defensive actions that are multi-domain, integrated, and cost-effective."

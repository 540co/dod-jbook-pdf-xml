GBOSS-E portion was $5.507 million in FY 2016.  OPA funding of $26.572 million in FY 2017 are Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds to procure components for Integrated Base Defense \u2013Kits (IBD-K) for 9 remote operating bases supporting Operation Inherent Resolve above the PB 2017 Request. The IBD-Ks will provide integrated and interoperable capability for persistent surveillance, entry control, perimeter security, data fusion and warn and alert to increase force protection and situational awareness in base camps."

In FY 2013, FY 2014 & FY 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities.\n\nGBOSS-E received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015. Pending successful Milestone B decision in FY 2017, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's GBOSS-E program requirements.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for GBOSS-E was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 11 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements. The Heavy Tower Trailer, EO\/IR, and RF Sensor which are the main cost drivers for the system will be competitively awarded through the product office and provided to a prime integrator with the TDP to construct future GBOSS-E systems. \n\nMilestone C is planned for FY 2020 and will align GBOSS-E, IGSSR-C, and Tactical Security System (TSS) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies."

            "val": "This program funds design, development and test of primary target acquisition and counterfire radars to automatically detect, locate and classify hostile indirect fire weapons (mortars, artillery, and rockets).  The program directly supports the prioritization, tracking and locating of targets, and dissemination of that information for simultaneous attack of multiple threats.  It provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counterfire target acquisition systems for all types and phases of military operations. Project L86, Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), version AN\/TPQ-50 provides 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers. The AN\/TPQ-50 and AN\/TPQ-53 radars are currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include operational support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).  Project L88, AN\/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that leverages the latest in technology design to accelerate technology infusion and increase range while improving false location rate, reducing obsolescence and increasing reliability. The AN\/TPQ-53 provides a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating mortar, artillery and rocket firing positions.\n\nThis program line also funds development of an integrated Hypervelocity Armament System (HAS), and associated technologies as they mature to support accelerated demonstration and transition of advanced gun weapon systems, command guided maneuverable projectiles, and tactical sensors. The development of HAS would include advancing artillery powder guns firing Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVPs), resulting in next-generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectiles capable of completing multiple missions with improved cost effectiveness across different gun systems. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow closed-loop targeting of moving and relocatable targets beyond the range of conventional artillery. \n\nThe Fiscal Year FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $17.294 million will support ongoing AN\/TPQ-53 test efforts and Army interoperability certifications (AICs), AN\/TPQ-50 and AN\/TPQ-53 development and testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction and required documentation."

The AN\/TPQ-50 system interoperates with mission command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility. The AN\/TPQ-50 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems. It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability. The AN\/TPQ-50 is currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).\n\nThe fiscal year (FY) 2020 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) funds of $4.913 million will continue the work required to enhance the AN\/TPQ-50's capability to address electronic protection against cyber electromagnetic activity (CEMA) and other known, new, emerging and evolving threats identified in the Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) report. This funding enables the program to develop and integrate sensor protect capabilities into the software baseline, develop advanced protection techniques which take advantage of hardware upgrades, and develop documentation for hardware and software capability improvements.

It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) and will replace the current AN\/TPQ-36 and AN\/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars.  The AN\/TPQ-53 system interoperates with mission command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN\/TPQ-53 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN\/TPQ-53 currently supports contingency operations to include Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and is fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Field Artillery Brigades (FABs) and Division Artilleries (DIVARTYs).\n\nThe FY 2020 funds of $12.381 million supports ongoing test efforts, continued extended range development and testing, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction and required documentation."

In 2006, the Government awarded a contract following full and open competition for the design of the AN\/TPQ-53 radar and the purchase of four non-recurring engineering (NRE) radars.  Twelve additional quick reaction capability (QRC) radars were purchased under the same contract in response to an urgent directed procurement in July 2008.  The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the acquisition of up to 20 more QRC radars.  Twenty systems were procured through two separate contract actions in 2010 and 2011.  A competitive production contract for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems was awarded in 2012 and options for additional systems were awarded in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  Production and delivery of all QRC\/Initial Production (IP) systems are complete, and production of LRIP systems is ongoing.  A Full Rate Production (FRP) decision was obtained in December 2015.  The FRP contract to fill the remainder of the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) was awarded in March 2017.  Additionally, all initial production systems will be retrofitted to the FRP configuration.  The AAO was increased from 174 to 189 systems in May 2017; 174 systems have been procured to date.  FRP system deliveries continue through FY 2021.  The system replaces all of the AN\/TPQ-36 and AN\/TPQ-37 systems in the fleet.\n\nRDT&E funding supports modernization development and extended range software development task orders under the existing FRP contract. The efforts extend through the current Program Objective Memorandum (POM) period.\n\nThe FY 2020 funds of $12.381 million supports ongoing test efforts, continued extended range development and testing, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), testing of modernization efforts for electronic protection and emerging threats as well as the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction and required documentation."

            "val": "In partnership with the Services and Defense Agencies, the Rapid Prototyping Program (RPP) encourages joint Service development through prototyping efforts that reduce risk, establish affordable and realistic requirements, and support timely development of fieldable capabilities demonstrated in an operational environment.  RPP addresses priorities identified by the National Defense Strategy, the Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities, the Chairman\u2019s Capability Gap Assessment, and Service or Agency identified capability gaps and needs.  Service and Agency senior executives participate in the project selection process to reduce duplication, synchronize prototyping efforts, and target projects with the widest benefit to the Joint Service.  Overarching program goals include enhanced warfighter lethality, modernization of cross-cutting technology areas, and delivering capabilities more quickly than traditional acquisition.\n\nRPP develops prototypes that reduce technical and integration risk to define and improve requirements for programs of record.  RPP project selection aligns to DoD modernization priorities including autonomous systems; hypersonics; fully networked command, control, and communications; electronic warfare; sensors for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and fire control.  RPP rapidly develops and fields cross-cutting, prototype capabilities that demonstrate in an operational environment to inform the DoD and Service leadership.  Individual projects generally receive one year of funding, typically at a cost of less than $10.000 million."

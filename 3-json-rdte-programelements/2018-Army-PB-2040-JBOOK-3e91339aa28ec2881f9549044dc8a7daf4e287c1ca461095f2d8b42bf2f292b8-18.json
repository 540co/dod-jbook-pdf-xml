The LTAMD Capability will address critical capability gaps, modernize technology, reduce O&S costs, mitigate obsolescence, and increase reliability and maintainability. The LTAMD Capability will increase sensor\/radar performance to maximize the inherent PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhanced (MSE) Interceptor capabilities to engage threats.\n\nLower Tier Air Missile Defense (LTAMD) Capability tasks include the programmatic and engineering activities needed for LTAMD-Capability post Milestone A activities, and preparation required to execute the competitive Technology Maturity and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract. Once proposed TMRR material solution have been evaluated, the development effort for LTAMD Capability will be continued into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to enable the prototyping, development, and testing of the LTAMD Capability. \n\nFY2018 base dollars in the amount of $76.728 million continues Lower Tier Missile Defense Capability to include programmatic and engineering activities needed for TMRR activities described above."

The non-prescriptive technical solutions provide maximum technical flexibility for industry to satisfy LTAMD capability requirements related to the implementation of an LTAMD Sensor\/Radar Set to replace the current force (PATRIOT) RS. The knowledge-point-centric assessment approach during the TMRR phase enables the government to down-select to the single best contractor for EMD using best value trade-off determination techniques.  This accelerated TMRR-to-EMD approach will provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat, refine the best materiel solution for LTAMD capability requirements, fosters full and open competition, reduces programmatic & technical risks, and substantially reduces total ownership cost (compared to the baseline RS being replaced by this LTAMD capability)."

A total of $1,273 thousand was transferred to the cyber PE from PE 0605803SE in FY 2021.  Subsequently, the PSA portion of the cyber funds in FY 2021 ($161 thousand) and remaining outyears, will be transferred to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), along with the non-cyber funding for the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) program.  The cyber PE of 0303140SE consists of the remaining programs: EDS, ICM, and PA."

            "val": "The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)). This PE includes application of R&D to support cybersecurity improvements across the DHRA enterprise.\n\nProject 1: Enterprise Data Services (EDS). Supports the cybersecurity activities related to DMDC\u2019s EDS mission. EDS is addressing two critical projects in FY 2021: 1) The Joint Officer Management (JOM) modernization initiative and 2)The development of the Enterprise Data to Decisions Information Environment (EDDIE).  \nThe legacy system JOM system was built in the 1990s and requires extensive redevelopment to resolve existing security issues and ensure new development complies with Department cybersecurity policies.\n\nEDDIE introduces a streamlined way to provide person based \u201cdata as a service\u201d and \u201canalytics as a service\u201d to all of DoD and other Federal Agencies. EDDIE will assist decision makers in forming relevant questions, retrieving pertinent information, and informing policy and program changes. In FY 2021 development will begin based on the findings of the Analysis of Alternatives; ensuring compliance with cybersecurity policies during and after this initial implementation will be a key component of successful system delivery.  This funding will be used to obtain support from cybersecurity experts during development.\n\nProject 2: Identity Credential Management (ICM). DMDC executes DHRA\u2019s responsibility to provide a central source of identification and authorization of people during and after their affiliation with DoD for identity protection, security, entitlements, and benefits verification. This funding will support the evaluation and testing emerging technologies that will develop more robust and secure capabilities for the Department\u2019s ICM program, including the analysis of the security posture of these technologies.\n\nProject 3: Personnel Accountability (PA).  This program is comprised of several systems, including: Synchronized Pre-deployment Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), Defense Travel System (DTS)\/Defense Travel System Modernization and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, DoD, DoS and USAID contractors and U.S. citizens.  This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of military operations, contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  This funding will be used to obtain support from cybersecurity experts during the modernization of these systems.\n\nNote: The Personnel Security Assurance (PSA) program  provides comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians and contractors including the technology and processes that need to be addressed in order to implement Continuous Evaluation.  The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. In FY 2021, responsibility for DISS, including cybersecurity support, will transfer to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA)."

            "val": "The SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line Of Effort (LOE) 1:  Unified Network. \n\nFE1: Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS)\/Digital Communications System (DCS) (Phase II):\nThis project develops Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems (MCNS) requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations.\n\nFE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE):\nMilitary Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.\n\nFE4 \/ Enroute Mission Command:  \nMission Description and Budget Item Justification:\nEnroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective. The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.\n\nDue to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018\/2019, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku FISA FOC (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.\n\nFI8:  Protected Anti-JAM Tactical SATCOM (Protected SATCOM) provides for a critical protected communications gap in anti-jam SATCOM capability across the Army with the denigration of the current protected terminal. It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against potentially catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement. It will offer the Tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional. The effort includes development of a critical Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem which will be integrated into Army tactical SATCOM terminals to provide higher throughputs, protection (anti-jam) against Electronic Warfare (EW), and resiliency in a contested environment; development of a dual small form factor modem that can run the PTW and the current Network Centric Waveform (NCW) to Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs) and eventually Army Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Teams; and development, testing and certification of prototype Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminals which will augment existing AEHF terminals. The PTW efforts are linked to the Air Force and DoD's plans for PTW on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) and its follow-on satellite constellation.\n\nIn FY2020, a new start development of Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototype. The new terminal will augment the existing capability of the Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) AEHF terminal, with the intent to backfill decreasing SMART-T numbers post FY2025. This ensures the Army's ability to meet increasing EW threat requirements. It will provide AEHF protected SATCOM capability in a modular, more transportable, vehicle agnostic form factor, providing greater flexibility on the battlefield. The terminal will be built with the intent to migrate from the AEHF constellation to the PTS constellation."

Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which improves SATCOM gateway resiliency while allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into WSOMS and EWSTS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband Satellite System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.

MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial & International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces.  These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.\n\nFY 2020 funds the systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM Communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This line continues to fund the systems architecture and analysis for current and future SATCOM efforts in both wideband and protected satellite communications.  This effort includes collaborative work with the Air Force on the prototype Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) development and associated modem testing.\n\nIn addition, FY 2020 funding covers the Narrowband Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Network Centric Waveform Tool (NCWT) Development and Testing and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations."

It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against potentially catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement. It will offer the Tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional. The effort includes development of a critical Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem which will be integrated into Army tactical SATCOM terminals to provide higher throughputs, protection (anti-jam) against Electronic Warfare (EW), and resiliency in a contested environment; development of a dual small form factor modem that can run the PTW and the current Network Centric Waveform (NCW) to Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs) and eventually Army Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Teams; and development, testing and certification of prototype Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminals which will augment existing AEHF terminals. The PTW efforts are linked to the Air Force and DoD's plans for PTW on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) and its follow-on satellite constellation. \n\nFY2020 funds will continue collaborative development, testing and certification with the US Air Force and Navy of a PTW modem and a Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS). The prototype of a protected modem and protected satellite were previously funded under the FE2 MILSATCOM Systems Engineering during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD). The PTW modem and the accompanying satellite constellation continue the spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities. The funding on FI8 Protected SATCOM incorporates the Army specific requirements to be included in these efforts. \n\nFY2020 funds will  start efforts to test commercial Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototypes to meet recently identified critical capability gaps for anti-jam SATCOM.  The new terminal will augment the existing capability of the Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) AEHF terminal, with the intent to backfill decreasing SMART-T numbers due to obsolescence. This ensures the Army's ability to meet increasing EW threat requirements."

The program will leverage contracts established by the Air Force for the development of Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modems, including development of a dual small form factor modem capable of running the PTW and Network Centric Waveform - Resilient (NCW-R), beginning in FY2020.  Production and Fielding of the PTW modems will begin in FY2023 under the Protected Anti-JAM Tactical SATCOM procurement line (B34002).\n\nThis project also funds the research, development and testing of an Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototype to aid in filling the identified critical protected communications.  This terminal is a direct follow-on effort to the Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T).  The Program Office is working closely with the US Air Force on scheduling insertion of the terminal into the satellite Mission Planner as well as working with NSA to develop a timely path to certification.  The terminal research and development effort will be awarded in FY2020; a developmental test combined with a robust Military utility user assessment will inform an FY2022 decision point on the path forward for the terminal."

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to develop new AT capabilities and evaluate AT implementations on weapon systems. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F. The AF AT OPR, that is also funded by this PE and is responsible for the oversight and security of AT on all AF acquisition programs under the Program Protection Planning process and manages AF AT technology development. \n\nThe DoD ATEA coordinates technology development among the DoD Services\/Agencies, National Laboratories, and Industry.\n\nAT protects critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. AT protections permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage and the combat capabilities of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters' mission requirements. Furthermore, AT adds longevity to DoD weapon systems and critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. \n\nAll DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation on all DoD Weapon Systems, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government off the shelf products. As technology advances, AT continues to perform AT hardware\/software assessment capabilities. These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and\/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and\/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.\n\nThe DoD ATEA technology development strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology development across the Services which fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and facilitate transition for programs to implement. The AT technology development and enhancement efforts include: advanced AT sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and other AT enablers. \n\nThe Air Force AT OPR conducts Anti-Tamper technology development to meet Air Force service needs to mature promising AT technologies to transition to Air Force weapons systems. Technology development priorities are given to those technologies that most benefit AF acquisition programs.  These activities are coordinated through the ATEA as a part of the ATEA technology development roadmap and to coordinate with Navy and Army AT technology development efforts.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The ATEA will also coordinate with the Service AT personnel to foster communication and understand what programs Services are developing for their AT implementation.

            "val": "This Program Element (PE) supports continued modernization of the Army's Medium Tactical Wheeled Vehicle fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, vehicle electrification, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.  Furthermore, the PE supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.\n\nThe Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) includes Cargo, Tractor, Load Handling System (LHS), Wrecker, Expandible Van, Shop Van, and Dump variants with payloads ranging from 2 1\/2-tons to 10-tons and associated companion trailers. FMTV trucks perform over 55 percent of the Army's local haul, line haul, and unit resupply missions.  It operates throughout theater as multi-purpose transportation vehicles in combat, combat support, and combat service support units.\n\nFunding from this Program Element will be used to support the continued evolution of the future FMTV fleet as well as tech insertion opportunities to keep the current FMTV fleet relevant on today's battlefield.  This includes upgrades in survivability and crew protection, improved safety by leveraging advancements in commercial active safety technologies, modernizing the aging Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) fleet of vehicles, improved utilization through modularity, integration of advanced high efficiency powertrains and fuel saving technologies, and insertion of autonomous vehicle capabilities that will change the way transportation missions are conducted around the world.\n\nFY 2021 Project H07 Base funds in the amount of $2.229 million will be used to conduct Operational Testing of the FMTVA2 truck and design and development of an LVAD Technical Demonstrator.\n\nThe Cold-weather All-Terrain Vehicle (CATV) is a tracked vehicle new start effort in FY 2021 that will provide transportation for up to a 10-Soldier element, emergency\nmedical evacuation, command and control capability, and general cargo transportation on- and off-road in an Arctic environment under a wide range of otherwise\nimpassable terrain, to include frozen ice, and extreme cold weather conditions to support year-round training as well as to conduct Homeland Defense (HD), Homeland\nSecurity (HS), and Defense support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) mission. The CATV will employ four carrier variants: General-purpose carrier variant capable of\nproviding transport for not less than 9 Soldiers, plus the driver within a cab\/enclosure (10 Soldiers) with equipment and supplies to sustain three days of combat\noperations. Ambulance capable of transporting medical equipment, two caregivers, and not less than two litter patients or four ambulatory patients in addition to the\ndriver within a cab\/enclosure. Command and Control (C2) providing the space weight and power to hosting standard Joint communications and common operating\npicture (COP) platforms. The C2 and COP equipment should be able to be used enroute or with minimal setup upon halt by six Soldiers in addition to the driver within\na cab\/enclosure. Cargo\/flatbed capable of carrying outsized equipment and cargo. The cargo variant should allow for loading cargo with a forklift from either side (i.e.\ndropside or flatbed configuration) and have a cab\/enclosure for two Soldiers (driver and vehicle commander).\n\nFY 2021 CATV budget activities in the amount of $6.294 million include a contract award under an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to evaluate the technical,\nmanufacturing feasibility and military utility of the Cold- weather All-Terrain Vehicle (CATV) Prototypes."

The FMTVA2 also addresses Space, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) constraints from having to host an increasing amount of C4ISR and Counter-IED equipment.  PD MTV is executing the FMTVA2 effort documented in a signed Acquisition Decision Memorandum by the AAE on 16 November 2015. FY 2021 Project H07 Base funds in the amount of $1.850 million will be used to conduct Operational Testing required per Chapter 141, Title 10 USC.\n\nThe FMTVA1P2 represents the FMTV model currently in production with over 40,000 vehicles fielded to date.  The FMTVA1P2 will remain in the tactical vehicle fleet until 2040 and beyond.  To keep the A1P2 fleet viable into the future and able to perform its mission in austere environments, upgrades to Survivability and Crew Protection Kits will be required as the threat on the battlefield evolves. \n\nThe three FMTV LVAD models (M1081, M1093, M1094) ended production in 2009 and represent the oldest vehicles in the FMTV fleet.  Updates to the LVAD are needed to address obsolescence issues and bring the configuration up to today's standards.  FY 2021 Project H07 Base funds in the amount of $0.381 million will be used for testing of an LVAD Technical Demonstrator developed using FY 2019 Project H07 funds.\n\nTo ensure supportability of the FMTVA1P2 through FY 2040 and beyond, the PD MTV, as lifecycle managers for the system, shall address potential obsolescence issues with the powertrain and Material Handling Equipment used on the FMTV.\n\nIncreasing survivability and crew protection of the FMTVA1P2 comes at the expense of decreased vehicle mobility and performance in soft soil and winter environments.  The A1P2 is being asked to carry more weight than what it was originally designed for.  Low risk, highly commercial improvements to the A1P2 driveline, suspension, and tires can be made to minimize the loss in mobility performance.\n\nFunding supports modernization of the current Tactical Wheeled Vehicle fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts."

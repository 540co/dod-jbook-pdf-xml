Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future programs of record, and reducing technology risk in order to transition of leap-ahead capabilities into acquisition programs. Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. This PE provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command (AFC), the Engineer Research Development Center (ERDC), and U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

The Technology Maturation Initiative takes emerging Science and Technology (S&T) products to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, integrating them into technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes that inform requirements and reduce the risk of technology insertion for future acquisition programs. This Initiative streamlines the development and insertion of mature technologies that support advanced ground systems; aviation systems; command, control, communication & reconnaissance systems and equipment; precision weapons; High Energy Laser (HEL) systems; and Soldier equipment. It provides the Army an improved mechanism for incorporating innovative technologies and advanced capabilities in the early stages of acquisition program planning, and more closely aligns high-priority S&T products and future Programs of Record.\n\nArmy senior leadership approves Technology Maturation Initiative projects prior to budget year programming based on priority and opportunity, ensuring that demonstrations have a high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Approved Technology Maturation Initiative projects are typically 2-4 years in duration and are budgeted under Projects AX4, AX5, AX6, AX7, AX8, AX9, AY1, AY2, and AY3.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Computation Prototyping Environment (CPE) provides the ability to validate platform design variations in a VPG, in a way that identifies potential performance and design failures, and assesses mitigating solutions and trades prior to cost-bearing production and manufacturing. Activities under this Project include the maturation and integration of physics-based, computational modeling with new advances in deep learning in order to provide the ability to virtually explore design tradespaces and understand possible defeat strategies. This Project leverages recent Department of Defense (DOD) advancements in large data tradespace analytics, high- fidelity physics-based modeling, deep learning techniques, high-performance computing capabilities, and inverse modeling approaches to enable rapid computational prototyping to inform emerging acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)."

These demonstrations will inform requirements, decrease risk for future Army HEL acquisition programs, and support the future development of warfighter Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures and Concept of Operations. HEL weapon systems are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to stockpile ordnance. A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); sensors; and optics for maneuvering Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs). Demonstrations will also inform potential future capability to defeat both fixed- and rotary-wing manned aircraft. Leveraging Government investments and Industry technology advancements, will review and select existing HEL subsystem designs for integration into a Stryker combat vehicle; will conduct integration and demonstration of a system-level HEL experimental prototype; and will provide assessment of technical performance in an operational environment.  This effort informs application of laser weapons to other combat platforms and rapid prototyping to units-of-action to meet emerging threats expressed in the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO)."

Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation and acquisition efforts to inform requirements for future programs of record and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are approved by Army senior leadership based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration, and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments in support of the Army's objective capability for Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD). A 50 kilowatt (kW)-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial systems(UASs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Activities also include sub-system prototyping and integration of leap-ahead ground combat vehicle powertrain technologies; and integration and demonstration of key Active Protection System (APS) components to provide modular and layered vehicle protection effects (hard-kill and soft-kill), enabling power projection and enhanced survivability. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. This Project provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishing a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) efforts and acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  Work in this Project is performed by the Army Futures Command (AFC); the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT); and the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).\n\nFunding has been realigned to reflect the FY20 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities."

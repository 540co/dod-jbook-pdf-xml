            "val": "All Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this Program Element (PE).  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element PE are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

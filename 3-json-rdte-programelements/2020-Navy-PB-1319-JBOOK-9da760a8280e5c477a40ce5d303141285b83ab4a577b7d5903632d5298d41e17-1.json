            "val": "This Program Element (PE) includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention. Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in technology and capability-related 'thrusts' which are consolidated in thirteen Naval Research and Development Framework focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet\/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.\n\nThe In-House Laboratory Independent Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to develop and maintain a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.\n\nILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers\/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.\n\nThis PE sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of Naval power and national security, by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs, and by providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). The research aligns to the Naval Research and Development Framework for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.\n\n\nDue to the number of efforts in PE 0601152N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the Department of Defense is managing its basic research program effectively."

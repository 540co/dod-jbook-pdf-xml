Maven uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon). This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision into the process of object detection, identification, and tracking at computer process speed versus human speed. Incorporating computer vision and algorithms will reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data. Project Maven develops algorithms focused on tactical UAV FMV Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and an operational PED environment for platforms and ground stations. AW builds capabilities,  integrate AI and machine learning (ML) to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for object detection, classification and user alerts."

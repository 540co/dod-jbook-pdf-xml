            "val": "- Increment 5 will be complete in 2019 with the final release recommendation for AMC platforms.  The remaining test events are paid with FY18 funds on contract.  The majority of work for Increment 5 was conducted in the MPS Modernization BPAC.  The Increment 5 BPAC was established for FY17 and FY18 only, in order to meet MAIS reporting requirements. The majority of the work for increment 5 was conducted in the MPS Modernization BPAC.\n\n- MPS software is a layered software, designed with open architected standards and modular construction.  The core of the MPS software is the Framework software (FW) used by all MPS platforms and the Navy.  Common Components are distinct services that are used by a select number of platforms.  An example would be weapon specific capability that fighters share.  The Unique Planning Component (UPC) is the platform specific software and associated software (install etc) that is delivered to the users in the form of a mission planning environment.  Traditionally the MPS Systems Program Office allocates FW funding to other Platform Operational Flight program (OFP) development programs.  In FY20, will continue FW effort but will establish it as a independent program. This tracks with the Navy and affords greater insight into the framework cost elements.  The FY20  R-Doc will list FW as a separate program in the MPS Modernization BPAC."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight re-planning as applicable.\n\nThe Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for most Department of Defense (DoD) platforms. It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed- and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions. It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service, open architecture system, frequently referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive\/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue. MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft and are shared with the selected programs in the Navy. MPS delivers significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.\n\nFY20 funding will allow continuation of the MPS Modernization project.  MPS will develop pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning capabilities for Air Force aircraft Global Positioning System (GPS) and weapons migrating from legacy mission planning systems to the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS),in addition to continuing support for new capabilities and updates for Air Force platforms\/weapon systems that have already migrated to JMPS.  These platforms\/weapon systems include, but are not limited to, the B-1, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, RC-135, and their associated weapons (e.g., Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), and Network Enabled Weapons (NEW). JMPS will support the development of follow on modernization efforts for MAFPS, SMACC CSAR (HC\/MC-130, HH-60)and Global Mobility (C-5,C-17,C-130, KC-10, KC-135, KC-46) to be delivered with the final MPS Inc 5 software releases. \n\nIn addition, FY20 funding will be utilized to continue the development of the Joint Precision Airdrop System- Mission Planning (JPADS-MP)system in conjunction with the Army. This program includes the JPADS-MP airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17, C-130 and other selected platforms as necessary and deliver a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions, as well as, precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/or standoff precision delivery. JPADS-MP enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, and other data to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.\n\nFinally, for MPS Increment 5, there is no FY20 development required as the final software delivery is planned for FY19.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight re-planning as applicable.\n\nThis project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) capability in conjunction with the Army.  JPADS provides a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/ or standoff precision delivery.  It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, while mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of exposure to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, and other data to accurately deliver payloads to U.S. and other friendly forces.\n\nConsolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable.  It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop.  Future initiatives are designated to achieve automation of airdrop planning and execution to reduce task saturation in the cockpit and support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) objective of moving to a two-man cockpit.  These efforts include the ability to automatically receive and use real-time winds in any location, calculation of a release point and airdrop in a single pass, the ability to conduct real-time objective area analysis to calculate probable damage estimates and execute dynamic re-tasking, the ability to conduct post-drop assessments, and the implementation of new technologies (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Touch Screen environment).\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight re-planning as applicable. This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60 other platforms, Framework (FW) and all Common Component (CCs) software tools for mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  MPS Modernization efforts are as follows:\n\n1) CAF MPS Modernization:  These development efforts modernize CAF Mission Planning Environments (MPEs).  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc.  The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF modernization effort include, but are not limited to, B-1 (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17, 17a and 18), F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9 and 10) and F-22 Increments 3.2B, 3.2M Release One, Release Two, and Release Three.  CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons including, but not limited to, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).  Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related JMPS MPE CCs, including Weapon Planning Software (WPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), GPS Crypto (including GPS M-code), Weather CC, etc.  CAF MPE Modernization includes, but is not limited to, the following platform efforts:\n\na. F-15 Modernization Phase II & III:  This modernization program consists of multiple software development efforts driven by OFP updates for F-15 Suites 7,8,9,9.1, and 9.2. Suite 7-9 MPE capabilities include, but are not limited to, Data Transfer Device (DTD) improvements, updates for new features in weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb I and II (SDB I and II), AIM-9X, AIM-120D, and Network Enable Weapon support elements (e.g. key handling, weapon data link and Link 16).  It will also include enhancements to the synthetic aperture radar planning tool (SAR-PT) and the global area reference tool as well as radar modernization updates (e.g. combat identification, radar planning tool enhancements).  Development efforts for F-15 Suite 8 include, but are not limited to, integration of B61 Life Extension Program (LEP), feature updates for several weapons, and the expansion of Link-16 messages sets.  F-15 Suite 9 MPE will include a variety of updates and enhancements for weapons and aircraft systems to include, but are not limited to, Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), a new Advanced Dual Core Process II (ADCP-II) computer as well as Digital Transfer Device\/Modules (DTD\/DTM) modernization.\n\nb. F-16 Block 40\/50 Modernization Phases I&II:  The F-16 Block 40\/50 modernization completed fielding and transitioned to full sustainment the 2Q of FY17.\n\nc. F-22 Modernization Phase I:  The F-22 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates v13.1, v14.0, v14.1, and v14.2.  These enhancements include, but are not limited to, the addition of improved capabilities for the AIM-9X and AIM-120D, the incorporation of additional electronic protection tasks, combat identification improvements, addition of an Inter-flight Data Link Gateway, Mode 5 IFF and Combat ID updates, Link 16 updates, and incorporation of the synthetic aperture radar planning tool.  Additionally, other new and emerging OFP-generated requirements will be addressed as identified by the operational user(s).  Other Common Component (CC) updates will also be completed as required.\n\nd. B-1 Modernization Phase I:  The B-1 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates for Releases 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 11.0.  It will incrementally update the platform MPE and provide updates to the aircraft mission capabilities, including adding sensor anywhere on tactical display, updating threat range rings and route re-planning capabilities, improving Air Coordination Order (ACO) file loading and the memory utilization in the onboard avionics updates.  Additionally, it will migrate the B-1 MPE to a native 64-bit environment and utilize Mission Planning Data Service Layers (MPDSL) to modernize the software architecture. \n\ne. The platform efforts include work associated with updates to the framework and associated services.  Beginning in FY20 the Framework will be broken out as a separate program with a unique funding line. \n\n2) MAF MPS Modernization:  These development efforts modernize MAF MPEs for the KC-46 aircraft as well as all Air Mobility Command platforms initially fielded under MPS Increment 5.  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP), Global C2, and AMC fuel efficiency requirements.\n\n3) The SMACC Modernization Program includes development, testing, and fielding of MP software for the E-3 DRAGON, E-3\/E-8, RC-135 and EC-130. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) is providing a new JMPS capability to the HH-60 and MC\/HC aircraft. The follow-on versions continue that development. \n\n4) MAF Modernization effort builds upon the fielded E-8 MPE to provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet (e.g. C-5, C-130, KC-10, etc.) as required to meet OFP, fuel efficiency, and global planning net-centric requirements.  It includes, but is not limited to, enhanced capabilities to accommodate avionics upgrades, improved communications systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new parachutes, etc. for various MAF platforms. Development efforts also include, but are not limited to, integrating improvements to MAF related Common Components (CCs).  Examples of these CCs include, but are not limited to, MAF tools, such as Assault Zone CC and the Air Refueling Tool (ART) CC.  CSAR Release 1.1 program began in FY17 modernizing the efforts begun with the CSAR products developed in MPS Inc 5.  The CSAR effort will continue to modernization via agile development with CSAR Rel 2.0 or with Milestone Decision Authority Approval, extension of the CSAR 1.1 program for the new requirements. \n\n5) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) Phase Two began in FY17. This effort modernizes the MAFPS products developed in Increment 5.  This effort completes the development of a centralized\/net-centric global mobility flight planning capability, which will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route, airspeed, and altitude optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data.\n\n6) Beginning in FY20 the MPS Framework will be established as an independent Program of Record (anticipated as an ACAT III).  The Framework represents the basic fundamental layer of the JMPS software.  It rides on SDC compliant Windows OS.  The basic services that all programs use (Falconview, Data Load, Route construction, flight planning etc)are included in the Framework architecture.  The Navy utilizes the same basic core Framework software.  The funding for the Framework has historically been accomplished through a \"tax\" to the platform mission planning budgets. The programs were based upon the platform OFPs and the fielded software packages (mission planning environments).  The program office will segregate Framework for future oversight.  Framework will be an agile development effort based on services developed in a  common development environment.  \n\nTest, Training, and Certification:  Continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for all CAF and MAF platforms.\n\nProgram Support:  Continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely development, testing, and delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.\n\nThe platform efforts include work associated with updates to the Framework and associated services. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability.The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

Currently there are five (5) contractors, one of which is Small Business set aside, who are qualified sources. Each Delivery Order (DO) is competed among the five contractors. Efforts to accomplish program activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are competitively awarded using a variety of contract types (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP), and Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)). Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations. Mitre, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center(FFRDC) contractor provides technical support on a no fee for service contract.\nOther efforts are accomplished via Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR). For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC\/HB) provides the program management, contracts, legal, and financial management support.

            "val": "This program element acquires the Polar MILSATCOM system that provides protected communications (anti-jam and low probability of intercept and detection) for users in the north polar region.  \n\nThrough FY 2005, Polar Satellite Communications funded three low data rate Milstar packages on three classified host satellites as an expedited, interim solution for protected connectivity requirements in the north polar region (i.e., Interim Polar System (IPS)).  Two satellites with hosted packages are required to provide the necessary 24-hour coverage.  The third package went into operations in November 2008 to sustain the 24-hour coverage.  \n\nIn FY 2006, the DoD began funding the next generation Polar Satellite Communications capability with two more polar packages via the same host vehicle type (i.e., EPS).  The host spacecraft and the polar communications packages required design modifications that replaced obsolete components and took advantage of the more capable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.  The EPS Capability Development Document (CDD), approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in September 2006, is based on a two-package, hosted XDR program with operational availability in CY 2015 and CY 2017.  EPS is comprised of four segments: Payload, Ground Control, Gateway, and Terminal (acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office).  Milestone B review was completed April 2, 2014.\n\nBeginning FY 2020, the EPS-Recapitalization (EPS-R) effort transferred from Program Element 1206434F, Midterm Polar MILSATCOM System to Program Element 1206432F, Polar MILSATCOM (SPACE).  In FY 2020, EPS-R continues to develop and acquire two Extremely High Frequency (EHF) payloads on hosted spacecraft and continues to upgrade\/modify the existing EPS Ground Control and Gateway.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Polar MILSATCOM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nSynch Polar Satellite Communications (SATCOM) with Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminal (FAB-T) saved $19.1M in FY 2020.  Synch Polar SATCOM with FAB-T Description: A two-year delay in strategic communications upgrades to Enhanced Polar System C2 network is necessary to synchronize SATCOM capabilities with airborne terminal fielding.  In alignment with the National Defense Strategy, funds were applied to classified programs, which improve lethality.\n\nFunding in this exhibit was previously budgeted in PE 0605432F, Polar MILSATCOM (SPACE), and PE 1206434F, Midterm Polar MILSATCOM System.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

EPS-R intends to host the payloads on a Space Norway bus scheduled to launch in CY 2022.  EPS-R will reuse EPS Gateway and ground control elements to the greatest extent feasible. \n\nTo meet the warfighter requirements for protected tactical and strategic polar MILSATCOM, RDT&E funding is required to continue program office and other related support activities including, but are not limited to studies, technical analysis, architectural development, technology maturation, System Engineering, Integration and Test of all polar MILSATCOM segments and hosted payloads.\n\nPrograms and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats.  Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms."

Two satellites with hosted packages are required to provide the necessary 24-hour coverage.  The third package went into operations in November 2008 to sustain the 24-hour coverage.  \n\nIn FY 2006, the DoD began funding the next generation Polar Satellite Communications capability with two more polar packages via the same host vehicle type (i.e., Enhanced Polar System (EPS)).  The host spacecraft and the polar communications packages required design modifications that replaced obsolete components and took advantage of the more capable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.  The EPS Capability Development Document (CDD), approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in September 2006, is based on a two-package, hosted XDR program with operational availability in CY 2015 and CY 2017.  EPS is comprised of four segments: Payload, Ground Control, Gateway, and Terminal (acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office).  Milestone B review was completed 2 April 2014.\n\nPrograms and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats.  Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Polar MILSATCOM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F."

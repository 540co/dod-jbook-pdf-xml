            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates Air Force enterprise-centric information technologies for the warfighter. The Anticipatory Operations Intent and Response project develops the technologies for dynamic planning and execution with the accuracy, fidelity, and timeliness needed to dominate the battlespace. The Assured Worldwide Connectivity project provides advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information exchange of near-real-time multimedia (i.e., voice, data, video, and imagery) information. In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air and space-based information exchange on and between platforms. These optical networks will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs) and air and space- based platforms either en route or in theater. This project also provides tools and applications leading to the development and integration of cyber deterrence technologies resulting in a strategic capability of cyber dominance within the secure information grid. The Global Battlespace Awareness project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and total battlespace awareness by using and exploiting information from all sources. The Knowledge Management and Computing project develops the technology applications that will provide for a secure, tailored, seamless exchange of information among producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to a particular community of interest (COI). The project also provides the development of interactive and real-time computing technologies that greatly improve the usability of high-performance computing for the exchange, utilization, and management of information in the enterprise. The Cyber Battlespace Development and Demonstration project develops the ability to deliver sovereign options in cyberspace through the development and integration of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies for a strategic capability of cyber dominance.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. Operational agility will require flexibility (manifested as multi-domain operations), speed (manifested as superior decision speed), coordination (manifested as dynamic command and control), balance (manifested as presenting a balanced capability mix), and strength (manifested as performance-optimized teams). In order to enable operational agility, this program will begin to shape future research and development (R&D) to focus on technologies in support of operational agility through multi-domain command and control (MDC2) capabilities.\n\nThis program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response; Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity; and Project 635322, Knowledge Management and Computing efforts were transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign planning and decision support, intelligent networking transport and management, and information management advanced technology development.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, will be transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, will be transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start. The Projects and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Technology Directorate located in Rome, New York.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

This project develops and integrates decision support technologies that will enhance the commander's ability to anticipate and dominate the future battlespace by more effectively forecasting the evolution of the battlespace and by more rapidly generating options to \"virtually checkmate\" the adversary. It develops the decision aid technologies and processes to plan the use of various assets and assess their effects in the battlespace. It provides a tailorable information environment to effectively portray complex data sets accurately in real-time.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response, efforts transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign technology areas that better support both the Air Force Future Operating Concept and National Defense Strategy."

It provides self-healing, self-configuration, anti-jam communication networking capabilities, and provides enterprise networking capabilities for agile, policy-based network management.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates flight ready systems consisting of high capacity radio frequency (RF) and optical components and architectures for next generation communications.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, the Air Force requires world-wide connectivity that is resilient and self-healing in the face of enemy attacks on communication and information assurance, able to withstand breaks in connectivity while still allowing users to collaborate with other connected operators to maintain localized situational awareness. The network balances the respective strengths of both forward-deployed forces and rear-based nodes.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity, efforts transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign technology areas that better support both the Air Force Future Operating Concept and National Defense Strategy."

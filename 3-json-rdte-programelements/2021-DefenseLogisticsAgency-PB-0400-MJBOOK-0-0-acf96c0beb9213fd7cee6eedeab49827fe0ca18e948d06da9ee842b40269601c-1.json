            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military services need to operate \u2013 including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Log R&D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. \n\nThe DLA Log R&D program is organized into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs):\n\u2022 Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (EAMD): R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  \n\u2022 Improving Logistics Processes (ILP): R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n\u2022 Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements (ELR): R&D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  This SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes.\n\nDLA\u2019s focus for this budget cycle highlights advanced capabilities in digital and technical data modernization, management and analytics to fulfill the DLA role in the DOD Digital Engineering Strategy and improve sharing of data with the industrial base and supported organizations. Investment explores technologies to lower the Agency\u2019s material acquisition and operations costs and improve weapons systems support. This effort spans across both DLA R&D Program Elements and multiple Strategic Focus Areas, impacting across the DOD Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel and DLA Enterprise logistics processes."

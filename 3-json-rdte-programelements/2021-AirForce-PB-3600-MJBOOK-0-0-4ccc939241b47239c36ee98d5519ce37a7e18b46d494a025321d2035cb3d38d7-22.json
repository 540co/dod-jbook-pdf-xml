Technologies matured and demonstrated impact affordability and availability of fielded aerospace weapon systems by reducing sustainment costs, extending service life, and maintaining  mission readiness and capability. This program develops and demonstrates maintenance, life cycle management, and system\/fleet decision making technologies that can be implemented to address operational sustainment issues and could influence future system sustainability decisions via risk reduction to support inclusion into new systems. Studies are conducted to analyze processes and methodologies for application of technologies to address sustainment issues across the force, identifying cross cutting applications for fielded systems, and opportunities for building in sustainability into future applications. This program also develops and demonstrates affordable advanced composites for aircraft structures of fielded and emerging systems.  This includes studies, analysis, and tests for application of composites to address sustainment and affordability issues across the force. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603199F, Sustainment Science and Technologies (S&T), and associated Project will be transferred to PE 0603030F, Air Force Foundational Development\/Demos, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

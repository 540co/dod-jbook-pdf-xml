            "val": "This Program Element (PE) supports upgrading the accuracy, timeliness, availability, and accessibility of scientific, technical, and management information at all levels of the Army Research and Development (R&D) community. Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership. Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues. This PE includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (Projects 720 and 727). This PE addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers. By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the PE expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (Project 729). Project 730 provides funding for assessments in attitudes and opinions, longitudinal trends in Soldier and leader perceptions, and emerging issues to provide senior Army leaders with information on Soldiers' perceptions to inform personnel policy and program decision-making concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues. Project 731 provides funding for support for Army high performance computing centers. Project 733 provides funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process, while Project C16 supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems. Finally, this PE funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (Project C18). Coordination of this PE with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Ft. Belvoir, VA, the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft.

In 1982, Congress, through the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) established the SBIR program to foster the involvement of US based small businesses in federal research and development (R&D). The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small, high-technology firms in the federal R&D endeavor and give driven businesses the opportunity to provide innovative R&D solutions in response to critical Army needs. The STTR program expands the public\/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small business and the nation's premier nonprofit research institutions. The most important role of the STTR program is to foster the innovation necessary to meet the nation's scientific and technological challenges in the 21st century. The SBIR\/STTR support services include program and technical advisory support services on a broad level. The Army SBIR\/STTR Program Management Office mission requires synergized, integrated business solutions that concentrates on small business technological advances, and eliminates redundancy in a codified and consistent method that reduces confusion and ambiguity for the thousands of small businesses that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs."

The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers. The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&S savings. FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers an Annual Program Review to facilitate sharing of lessons learned between science advisors at combatant commands, assists Combatant Commanders (COCOMS) with their annual Science and Technology Conferences. FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office). FAST supports warfighters in contingency operations with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by: AMC, Redstone Arsenal, AL; and Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

            "val": "This program covers research in Directed Energy (DE) technologies, primarily High Energy Lasers (HEL); including devices, subcomponents, and novel materials; optical beam control; laser system integration; target laser lethality\/vulnerability assessments; ground-based optical Space Situational Awareness (SSA); and high power microwaves (HPM). Laser research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications, optical technologies to propagate laser beams through the atmosphere, and integration of these technologies into demonstration packages.  Space Situational Awareness research uses the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) and the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) to develop and implement technologies to identify visual characteristics such as status and health of orbiting space objects.  In high power microwaves this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons. This program conducts research into other novel Directed Energy applications; conducts Directed Energy vulnerability\/lethality assessments; develops protection technologies versus Directed Energy; conducts research into other advanced non-conventional\/innovative weapons; develops and uses tools to compare solutions to determine the most effective and efficient Directed Energy technologies to meet Air Force needs; coordinates efforts through the Department of Defense Science and Technology  Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

            "val": "This program element was for Army Tactical Missile System Block II (ATACMS BLK II) missile system Brilliant Anti-Armor (BAT) sub-munition.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, it was re-purposed for BREAKER and in FY 2019, Cross Domain (CD) ATACMS was added.  BREAKER ended in FY 2019 and CD ATACMS was moved to a different program element.  In FY 2020 and beyond, Program Element (PE) 0604768A Brilliant Anti-Armor Sub-munition (BAT) funds only Palletized Field Artillery Launcher (PFAL).\n\nProject P01. Multi-Mode Seeker began integrations of Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) STRIKE-X program demonstrated capabilities into ATACMS.  This effort focuses on providing integration of a seeker to search, detect, acquire, and engage moving maritime\/land-based targets. There is no funding in FY 2021.\n\nProject 688 is a developmental effort for the PFAL. Previously, PFAL was STRIKE-X capability 1 of the SCO Demonstration program and Cross Domain (CD) ATACMS was STRIKE-X capability 3.  PFAL is a palletized erectable launcher that provides alternatives to deliver near-term innovative long-range strike capabilities to improve operational effectiveness for Combatant Commanders. The PFAL launcher consists of an erectable palletized mechanical structure, Fire Control System (FCS), and Power Management System (PMS). PFAL is capable of firing all current Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) rockets and missiles, to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the ATACMS, and future munitions such as the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Extended Range (ER) GMLRS.  PFAL is capable of carrying two launch pods each containing either six GMLRS \/ MLRS rockets or one ATACMS missile. The PFAL launcher is capable of firing from a fixed ground position, Palletized Load System (PLS) trailer, or maritime vessel. \n\nFY 2021 Base funding in the amount of $24.975 million for Project 688 ATACMS BLK II funds the integration efforts needed to implement design improvements required to begin a user evaluation.  Base year funding allows for continued design, development, and integration to ensure the safe and effective deployment of operational prototypes in a continuous user evaluation. Procure and receive hardware\/materials to implement design improvements to the mechanical structure, FCS, and\/or PMS subsystems of existing prototypes transitioned from SCO. Support component-level and system-level qualification and integration. Conduct flight tests of existing munitions with existing prototypes to evaluate readiness for supporting a user evaluation. Procure long lead-time hardware\/materials necessary to start the fabrication of up to 7 additional prototypes."

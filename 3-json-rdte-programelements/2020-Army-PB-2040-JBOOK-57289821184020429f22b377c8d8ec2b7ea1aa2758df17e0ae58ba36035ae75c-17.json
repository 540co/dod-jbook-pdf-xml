TLS is a dedicated, all weather, 24\/7, ground-based tactical system providing Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic Warfare Support (ES), Electronic Attack (EA) and Cyber enabling capabilities to support the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) and Expeditionary-Military Intelligence Brigade (E-MIB) commanders. TLS provides Indications and Warnings, Force Protection and Situational Awareness to influence the commander's decision cycle, improve targeting timeliness and accuracy, and provide the maneuver commander with electronic attack and offensive cyber warfare options to deny, degrade, disrupt, or otherwise manipulate the targeted force. TLS employs technologically advanced systems with a modular open-system approach for dismounted, vehicle mounted, and extended range operations that can be efficiently sustained and effectively upgraded to provide capabilities against changing near peer and emerging threats."

These efforts will be used, but are not limited to identify, develop, prototype, evaluate, analyze, and demonstrate potential enhanced capabilities and extended range alternative solutions. These efforts will quantify the respective maturity and effectiveness to mitigate capability gaps against changing near peer representative enemy target sets and operational scenarios. Enhanced capability, extended range and other technologies to provide overmatch capabilities will be evaluated for merit and will provide increased performance for production of TLS systems in FY2022.The TLS program will leverage all authorities to accelerate delivery."

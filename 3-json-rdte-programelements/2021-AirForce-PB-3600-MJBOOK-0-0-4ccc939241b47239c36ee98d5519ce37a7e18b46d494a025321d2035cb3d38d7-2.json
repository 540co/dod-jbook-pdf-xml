This program funds multi-disciplinary research institutes to conduct research on laser, laser beam control and high power microwave technologies.  In addition, this program supports educational grants to stimulate student interest in directed energy and encourage graduate research in topics related to high energy lasers and high power microwaves.  These educational grants are used for educational tools, scholarships, and summer intern employees in military laboratories.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 615097 is renamed from High Energy Research Initiatives to Joint Directed Energy Basic Research. This project name change reflects the direction in the 2017 and 2018 National Defense Authorization Acts. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."

The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach that integrates mature technologies to build to the full capability. Air SS reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved laser eye protection, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and tactile situational awareness cueing. Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers."

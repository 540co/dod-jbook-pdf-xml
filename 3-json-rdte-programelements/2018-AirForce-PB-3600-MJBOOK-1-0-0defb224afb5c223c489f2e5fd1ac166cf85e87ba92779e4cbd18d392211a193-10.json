As a command, control and communications center directing US forces, executing emergency war orders and coordinating the activities of civil  authorities including national contingency plans, this capability ensures continuity of operations plans and continuity of government as required in a national emergency or after negation\/destruction of ground command and control centers.\n\nThe E-4B NAOC Recapitalization effort will replace the aging E-4B fleet which faces capability gaps, diminishing manufacturing sources, increased maintenance costs, and parts obsolescence as it approaches the end of its serviceable life.  The recapitalization effort will be informed by Air Force and Department of Defense analyses used to determine a holistic approach to replacing the aging E-4B fleet and integrating its capabilities with other nuclear and national command and control mission sets.\n\nIn 2015, the Joint Staff completed a Mission Area Analysis (MAA) focused on the Nuclear Command, Control and Communication (NC3) National Military Command system (NMCS) airborne fleets.  This analysis examined alternative architectures and CONOPS for achieving requirements, and suggested potential programmatic, platform, and\/or mission system synergies across and between fleet recapitalization programs (E-4B, E-6, VC-25, C-32).  Further, the Joint Staff documented the essential functions necessary to execute Nuclear Command and Control, and defined the operational role of the NC2 enterprise out to 2030 in an NC2 CONOPS.  From 2014-2016, the Joint Staff performed a NC2 Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) to determine potential gaps in the NC2 mission and architecture.  The findings of these studies have culminated in an evolved NMCS \u201caerial layer mission alignment strategy\u201d that allows the Department of Defense (DoD) to consolidate the airborne command center capabilities provided by the E-4B and E-6B into a single fleet of uniformly-configured aircraft.  This concept is known as the Survivable Airborne Operations Center, or SAOC.\n\nBA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

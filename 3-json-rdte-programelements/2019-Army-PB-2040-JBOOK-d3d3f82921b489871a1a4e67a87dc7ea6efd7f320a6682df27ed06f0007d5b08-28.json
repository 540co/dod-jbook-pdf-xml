The G-BOSS(E) Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved May 2014. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. G-BOSS(E) received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015. Pending successful Milestone B decision in FY 2017, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's G-BOSS(E) program requirements. The acquisition strategy for G-BOSS(E) was signed by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 11 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements. The Heavy Tower Trailer, EO\/IR, and RF Sensor which are the main cost drivers for the system will be competitively awarded through the product office and provided to a prime integrator with the TDP to construct future GBOSS-E systems.  Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align G-BOSS(E), IGSSR-C, and Tactical Security System (TSS) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. \n\nThe Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. IGSSR-C received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was signed by the MDA on 5 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to develop, integrate and test the Initial Capability (IC).  Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)), Tactical Security System (TSS) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. \n\nThe IBD acquisition strategy is to leverage existing IBD-related government organizations and to competitively award multiple contracts in support of IBD objectives for the development of holistic IBD architectures and products to support interoperability of fielded and emerging IBD-related systems.\n\nFY19 funding supports IBD JUONS 0540. Product Manager Force Protection Systems is overseeing the integration of both Commercial Off The Shelf and Government developed technologies that will address the identified capability gap to the existing Force Protection structure."

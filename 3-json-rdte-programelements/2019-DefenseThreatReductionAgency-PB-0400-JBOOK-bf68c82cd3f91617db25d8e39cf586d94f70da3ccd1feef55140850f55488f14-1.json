The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.\n\nThe portfolio advances DTRA\u2019s Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by balancing the following imperatives: invest in DTRA\u2019s applied research capabilities and increase the CWMD technology base to maximize future pay-off; capitalize on opportunities to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges that must be resolved prior to system-specific technology investigations and development; and ensure applied research efforts are directly aligned to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities.  The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project.  On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.\n\nDTRA\u2019s Counter - Improvised Explosive Device \/ Counter- small Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-IED\/C-sUAS) mission includes three primary lines of effort - attack the supporting threat network, protecting US forces, and building partner capacity.  Since DTRA already provides this support in helping the Department counter IEDs for the US joint force, it follows that DTRA is the most-appropriate Department asset to undertake this C-sUAS coordination mission - to provide counter threat network support to deployed forces, C-IED\/C-sUAS technology solutions, C-IED\/C-sUAS training support (deploying and deployed US joint forces), and building partner nation capacity all while coordinating the overall Department's (C-IED\/C-sUAS) efforts."

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments.  The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft.  Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems.  The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD strategic deterrence system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment.  This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration.  These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group.  The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects."

These activities are critical enablers for the development of advanced CWMD planning tools and include Advanced Energetics and Advanced Life Sciences.  Advanced Energetics develops energetic materials and weapon design technology providing advanced defeat capabilities for engaging hard and deeply buried targets that are well beyond current high explosive blast\/fragmentation warhead technology.

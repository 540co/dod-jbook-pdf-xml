            "val": "Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations as described in the approved SSA Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses intelligence on adversary space operations; surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, disseminations, and archiving activities.  This program develops new Air Force sensors and improved information capabilities for integration across the SSA network. It also includes developmental planning and technology forecasting for future blocks and emerging needs.\n\nThe Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Block 10 satellite was launched September 2010 with a design life through 2018 and an extended operational capability through 2020.  The SBSS Follow-On (SBSS FO) program will develop and deliver a system to continue providing space object surveillance from space post SBSS Block 10 End-of-Life. AFSPC and NRO have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) partnering SBSS FO with an NRO program based on overlapping requirements. The new partner program is called SILENTBARKER. SILENTBARKER requirements will be based on a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) and upon the current SSA ICD architectural requirements focused on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs). SILENTBARKER will provide the capability to search, detect, and track objects from a space-based sensor for timely custody and event detection.  Surveillance from space augments and overcomes existing ground sensor limitations with timely 24-hour above the weather collection of satellite metric data only possible with a space-based sensor and then communicates its findings to the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), National Space Defense Center (NSDC), and other classified users.\n\nThe Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program is a subset of COSMIC-2 that provides three sensors for each of the six spacecraft of the COSMIC-2 constellation. These sensors measure ionospheric density and irregularities to mitigate adverse space weather impacts on communication, navigation, surveillance, and other radio frequency systems used by the warfighter.\nDevelopment activities enable deployment of new advanced sensors capable of searching for and identifying threats, tracking the expanding number of debris objects on orbit, as well as the increasing number of satellites launched by other nations, many of which are smaller and more capable than previous spacecraft.  These activities are also required to better integrate the disparate elements of SSA in order to enable rapid and responsive space operations.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Space Situational Awareness weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because the initial contract has been awarded conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. Milestone B approval and requirements validation are imminent."

The SBSS Follow-On (SBSS FO) program will develop and deliver a system to continue providing space object surveillance from space post SBSS Block 10 End-of-Life. AFSPC and NRO have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) partnering SBSS FO with an NRO program based on overlapping requirements. The new partner program is called SILENTBARKER. SILENTBARKER requirements will be based on a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) and upon the current Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) architectural requirements focused on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs). SILENTBARKER will provide the capability to search, detect, and track objects from a space-based sensor for timely custody and event detection.  Surveillance from space augments and overcomes existing ground sensor limitations with timely 24-hour above the weather collection of satellite metric data only possible with a space-based sensor and then communicates its findings to the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), National Space Defense Center (NSDC), and other classified users."

To satisfy the SSA architecture needs, the SBSS FO program requirements combined with an NRO program and were updated in the December 2017 SILENTBARKER Statement of Capabilities.  The SBSS FO program remains an Air Force program, but will leverage NRO processes to fulfill SBSS FO space segment and telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) program segments in order to further National Security Space objectives.  Mutual investment for the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost enables the potential for a larger initial constellation buy and lower unit costs.

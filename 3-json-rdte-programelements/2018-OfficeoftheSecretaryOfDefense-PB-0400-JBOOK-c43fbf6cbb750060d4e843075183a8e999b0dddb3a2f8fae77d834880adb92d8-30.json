Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.\n\nP456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM), co-sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment (ASD(EIE)), develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power\/energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, (2) increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (3) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services and will be used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)."

TROPEC conducted four field assessments and completed three lab assessments, partnered with two winning FY16 OECIF unmanned systems proposals, delivered two newsletters, and coordinated with countless organizations on future assessment opportunities.\n\nThe consortia programs begun in FY13 generally reached their conclusion.  The Tactical Microgrid Standards Consortium (TMSC) incorporated DoD and industry comments and finalized the draft Tactical Microgrid Standards.  The Energy Efficient Outpost Modeling Consortium (EEOMC) completed the verification and validation (V&V) plan for the Energy Resource Planning Tool, updated the Commander's Application to enhance mode prioritization and optimization of generators and demonstrated with hardware, and offered pilot courses on energy efficiency in expeditionary operations.  The Soldier and Small Unit Power consortium assisted the Marines in drafting their Dismounted Forces Energy Requirements Concept of Employment policy document; utilized the Power and Energy Test Bed to characterize Nett Warrior baseline configurations for Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier supporting Program of Record Milestone decisions; and established a multi-agency, multi-Service consortium to coordinate Dismounted Warfighter efforts for the future.  The Engineered Surface Materials and Coatings Drag Reduction consortium conducted flight tests, and reviewed proposals and made Phase 1 technology maturation awards to selected drag reduction \u201cChallenge\u201d winners.\n \nThe analytical methods programs started in FY14 have continued.  The Synthetic Theater Operations Research\nModel-Energy (STORM-E) effort translated a series of tool-based, OE focused, roadmap model enhancements, and performed Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) scenario development activities for implementation in STORM.  The Operational Energy Analysis Task Force (OEATF) completed V&V of technical reports for the Fuel Consumption Prediction Model (FCPM) and Shelter Thermal Energy Model (STEM); conducted Soldier-level excursions using the Infantry Warrior Simulation (IWARS) to investigate the impact of system failure during combat operations; completed scenario enhancements for the second of three scenarios; continued to make enhancements to the Fully Burdened Cost Tool (FBCT) and successfully transitioned FBCT operations to the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC); and completed the baseline Phase IV model using the System of Systems Analysis Toolset (SoSAT).  The Joint Deployment Energy Planning and Logistics Optimization Initiative (J-DEPLOI) program brought software developer Group W on contract, developed a plan for integration of their decision support tool into the Map-Based Planning Services (MBPS) system, began adaption of existing software code to meet new requirements for fuel planning, and completed an implementation directive for the new tool's development.  The Comprehensive Operational Energy (COE) Toolkit program completed the programming and graphical user interface to measure, model, and examine the installation OE damage and capacity reduction caused by enemy interdiction.  The Mission Engineering Analytical Method for Operational Energy program (MEAM) integrated and refined prototype tools with as much verified fuel consumption data as could be identified and developed a range of excursion assessments based upon wartime scenarios, established cost analysis methodology, and investigated the ability of the tool to support future surface combatant platform design and force structure.  The Capability Assessment & Modeling for Energy Logistics (CAMEL) program developed methods and tools to explore airlift and aerial refueling effects within anti-access\/area-denial (A2AD) environments; explored the impact of counter operational energy threats, military infrastructure investment and adaptive basing strategies; completed analysis of advanced combat engine technology impacts; and began analysis of costs incurred with flex basing.\n\nThe major program started in FY15 is called \u201cImproving Fuel Economy for the Current Ground Tactical Fleet Program,\u201d and consists of four separate programs.  The Thermally Efficient Cylinders program prepared and reconfigured the single-cylinder test laboratory for efficiency and heat rejection measurements, and developed a testing and modeling and simulation plan.  The Tactical Vehicle Electrification Kit (TVEK) program has completed two major System Engineering processes (TARGET GATE 1 - Ideation & Scoping \uf0e0 Concepts & Feasibility, and System Needs Review) to kick off the project, began procuring critical long lead inverter controllers (20kW and 75kW), procured Caterpillar (CAT) 15 engine and instrumentation for fuel map testing, signed Memoranda of Agreements (MOAs) with all internal and external Integrated Project Team (IPT) organizations, and completed market surveys for DC\/DC converters and other electrification subsystems.  The Automation\/Smart Cruise Control program completed Phase I of single vehicle simulation, upgraded hardware, and conducted vehicle tests.  The Modeling and Simulation (M&S) for Vehicle Light-Weighting program began developing the analytical framework for the baseline Finite-Element Analysis (FEA) system model and Multi Body Dynamics model to generate loading for the FEA model, examined various vehicle components to target for light-weighting, and conducted weight optimization studies on components.\n        \nThe Joint Infantry Company Prototype (JIC-P) program performed small scale user evaluations with multiple units, conducted a human factors study on the kinetic harvesters, and continued to improve M&S data.\n \nFor the shorter term projects funded using add money from FY15, accomplishments for FY16 include the following.  The Cyber program completed seven cyber-security threat assessments at defense fuel supply points and installations.  The M&S Federations program has succeeded in finalizing contracts with all performers, and secured agreements to participate throughout the life of the program with Departmental partners designated as potential transition partners for any capabilities developed.\n\nNew programs started in FY16 reflect a shift within OECIF from an emphasis on contingency bases to one on mobile platforms for the Pacific.  The new program focus will improve the operational energy performance of unmanned air, sea and ground systems that could be used in the Pacific.  The Reliable, Efficient, Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Power System program identified the contract vehicle and worked on the contract award to build the Great Horned Owl engine.  The Hybrid Tiger team developed the major software architecture for hybrid vehicle control, completed initial vehicle (wing) sizing to include spreadsheet analysis of combined fuel cell and solar performance, and initiated a contract through the Naval Research lab Contracting Division.  The Hydrothermal Vent Exploitation for Undersea Power and Energy (HTVE-UE) program initiated the funding coordination documentation for awarding a small business performer contract, and commenced several of the studies and analyses related to HTV characteristics, potential environment impacts of this initiative, and various concepts of operations (CONOPS).  The Aluminum-Water Power for Unmanned Undersea Vehicles program began testing of the start system, and component requirements are being defined for the preferred configuration.  The Small Turboprop Engine Range\/Power Enhancement program initiated the procurement package for the engine demonstration, started the Operational Benefits Analysis (OBA), completed the baseline engine model, is working on the Improved Performance Technology Engine (IPTE) model, and is working with the Air Force and Pacific Command (PACOM) on selecting missions of interest for the MQ-9 Reaper to use to assess operational benefit.  The JP-8 Fuel Cell Power program awarded two contracts to begin JP-8 reformer based fuel cell power system development, and began concept refinement and initial instrumentation diagrams."

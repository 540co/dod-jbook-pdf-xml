Asymmetric threats are characterized by an environment in which an adversary employs a combination of conventional weapons, irregular tactics, and\/or terrorism to obtain their objectives.  The end-state of the PE is to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of research projects, taking the most promising proposals and translating them into practical prototypes for use against asymmetric threats.\n\nActivities within this PE are driven by efforts to understand, anticipate, illuminate, isolate, and mitigate asymmetric threat networks and enable timely research that hastens the development of new capabilities for countering global asymmetric threats, their associated networks, and emerging technologies."

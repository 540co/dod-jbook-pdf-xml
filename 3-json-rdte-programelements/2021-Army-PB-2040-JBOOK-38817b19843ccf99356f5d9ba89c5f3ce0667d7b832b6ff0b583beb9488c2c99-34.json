Subsequent to a decision for materiel development, the N-CFT develops and refines capability documentation aligned with the appropriate transition approach.  The N-CFT will inform technology transitions, research and development, and user assessments, and then rapidly transition to appropriate Programs of Record.\n\nFY 2021 funds will support identification, maturation, demonstration, and evaluation of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6+ systems and subsystem components including, but not limited to, resilient Line of Site (LOS) and beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications, information systems and information management; cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA) situational understanding and operations; intelligence fusion, cloud technologies, virtual augmentation, artificial intelligence, and data convergence and analytics in the Common Operating Environment to inform the Integrated Tactical Network\/Enterprise Network and Enabling Functions, Computing Environments, Interoperability and Command Posts. Successful solutions identified through evaluation in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment will be transitioned to Programs of Record for integration and fielding. Funds will also support integration with solutions identified in the other Modernization CFT efforts to ensure network dependencies are addressed."

These efforts will be demonstrated and evaluated with FORSCOM and inform the program technical baseline and DOTMLPF. Will conduct iterative Technical Exchange Meetings with Industry that will assess, demonstrate, prototype, and integrate emerging industry solutions to mature Command Post capabilities.

These efforts support advanced component development activities that are aligned to the Army's Tactical Network Capability Set development and fielding plans.\n\nThis funding will inform design decisions for future tactical network capability sets in the areas of Aerial Tier, LEO, MEO, GEO high throughput satellite capabilities, cyber hardened communications, and resilient Line of Site (LOS) and beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) waveforms through evaluation and technical maturation. It will increase bandwidth and range; improve mobility and network security; harden the network and support interoperability with Joint and Unified Action Partners.  \n\nThis project enables a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide and in any environment. It includes the development of a standards-based network architecture that unifies enterprise and deployed network capabilities and features a unified transport layer, network operations and other enabling functions that allows integration of disparate networks. The Army network will provide resiliency through path diversity and dynamic routing to ensure tactical units can communicate in hostile environments. It will provide multiple ways to communicate and give commanders the ability to choose their communications methods and tools during operations. It fully incorporates cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.  The ITN\/IEN enables Unified Action Partner Interoperability through integration into the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).  Interoperability is the ability to routinely act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical, operational, and strategic objectives. Interoperability between disparate forces allows coalitions to produce greater combat power than the sum of their parts by leveraging relative strengths while mitigating relative weaknesses."

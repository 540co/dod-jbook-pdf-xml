            "val": "Demonstrates technologies supporting transition to advanced component development.  This includes physical capabilities which cover biological and chemical detection, situational awareness and effects modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Other major efforts support enhanced chemical detection capabilities for aerosols and non-traditional agents, expanded capabilities for biosurveillance in pathogen detection and diagnosis, and pretreatments and therapeutics against a broader set of chemical and biological agents.  Medical capabilities (pretreatments, therapeutics, diagnostics capabilities, and drug manufacturing and regulatory science technologies), include capabilities against non-traditional agents.\n\nIn the physical sciences area, Project CB3 focuses on demonstrations of CB defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, information system technology for hazard prediction and systems performance, and protection, and decontamination.  The Project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents. \n\nAll non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is consolidated in Project NT3.  This Project includes NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.\n\nThe medical program in Project TM3, aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.  \n\nProject TT3, Techbase Technology Transition, pursues efforts to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.\n\nOne function of the CBDP S&T Advanced Technology Development budget is to preserve critical core competencies in the DoD Service laboratories which includes: United States Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), United States Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, Naval Research Lab (NRL), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), among others.  The intent is to maintain strategic partnerships with the DoD Service communities for mission success across the enterprise through collaborative planning and programming maintaining budget assurance.\n\nThe PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for PE 0603884BP\/PE 0604384BP activities."

Efforts supply test methodologies and supporting science to verify capabilities, develop protection and hazard mitigation options, expand hazard assessment tools, and develop MCMs against NTAs.  This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing NTA defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.  This project supports advanced technology development of NTA defense science and technology initiatives and transitions them to Budget Activities 4 and 5."

In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines."

These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies including limited objective experiments, laboratory experiments, risk reduction efforts, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and\/or cost effectiveness.  Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated.  Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can remain in place for future extended user evaluations, accepted into the advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.  This project addresses four family of products areas: Biological Resiliency, to include Biosurveillance; Integrated Early Warning, to include Remote Detection; Chemical and Biological Warfare Agent Destruction and Disablement; and Hazard Mitigation.  Biological resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats.  Integrated Early Warning is conducted through a coordinated program approach focused on layering Chemical and Biological Detection technologies and integrating CB threat indicators with rapid response actions.  WMD Disablement and Destruction addresses detection, identification, verification and baseline assessments in support of expeditionary forces deployed in non-permissive environments.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes."

The RMUA is a formal development and experimentation process with the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCOE) and the Joint Combat Developer that enables both material and non-material solutions through the identification and integration of innovative CB technologies.  These new capabilities are demonstrated via an agile, short-timeline (6-12 month) to enable transition of mature technologies to Advanced Component Development and Prototype programs.  The Demonstration Concept Development and Experimentation effort validates technology requirements and scopes future ATD programs with Warfighter stakeholders, including Combat Developers and Service representatives.

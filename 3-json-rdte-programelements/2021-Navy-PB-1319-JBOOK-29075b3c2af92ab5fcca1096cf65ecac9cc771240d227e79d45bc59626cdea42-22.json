Naval investment in these areas is essential in order to improve the ability to enhance, maintain, and sustain Warfighter effectiveness. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Office of the Secretary of Defense Communities of Interest.\n\nToday's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&D Framework.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and\/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system\/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment)."

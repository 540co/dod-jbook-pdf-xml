                            "val": "Note: \"NAVSTAR\" will be removed from the program title in this Budget Line Item in the next budget submission. \n\nIn FY 2021, PE 1203164F, NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (User Equipment) (SPACE) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3620, Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Space Force, PE 1203164SF, NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (User Equipment) (SPACE) from Appropriation 3600, Budget Activity 04 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) distribution system. GPS User Equipment (UE) consists of standardized receivers, antennas, antenna electronics, and other related equipment, grouped together in sets to derive navigation and time information transmitted from GPS satellites. These receiver sets are used by the Department of Defense (DoD). Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds UE development, integration, test, and analysis for new PNT receiver capabilities in Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) across all military platforms using GPS services.\n          \nThe Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) Increment (Inc) 1 program is responsible for the development of standard modernized receiver form factors for the Service-nominated lead platforms. The MGUE Inc 1 Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) on 24 July 2014. MGUE Inc 1 is initiating a new family of modernized GPS receivers that will deliver significantly improved capability to counter current and emerging PNT threats and enable military operations in a NAVWAR environment where current legacy receiver performance would be compromised. MGUE Inc 1 received a Milestone A decision in April 2012. The program received direction in February 2014 from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) to execute a new acquisition strategy, accelerating the program to provide test units faster to facilitate military end users. The MGUE program received a Milestone B decision in January 2017. \n          \nThe MGUE Inc 2 effort will continue to expand Military-Code (M-Code) receiver technology into additional applications (space receivers and precision guided munitions), and develop a modernized Handheld device to meet Service requirements. This effort leverages the MGUE Inc 1 technology to the maximum extent while addressing the production of M-Code integrated circuits far into the future. The MGUE Inc 2 program is being executed in three parts: 1) Risk Reduction Activities, 2)  Miniature Serial Interface (MSI) Receiver Card Middle Tier Acquisition rapid prototyping, and 3) Joint Modernized GPS Handheld Receiver Middle Tier Acquisition rapid prototyping effort.  The JROC approved the MGUE Inc 2 CDD on 6 April 2018.  The Air Force Service Acquisition Executive approved the MGUE Inc 2 Acquisition Strategy to include designation of two Middle Tier Acquisition Rapid Prototype efforts: 1) Miniature Serial Interface (MSI) Receiver Cards to include next-generation Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and 2) Joint, Modernized Handheld Receiver.\n          \nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $2.381 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n          \nThis Program Element (PE) may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MGUE weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n                   \nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

This strategy establishes the signal compatibility and security criteria along with a process for evaluating components to enable rapid movement from development to fielding. The pillars of this effort are: (a) establishing time certain and low risk development; (b) bounding requirements to leverage mature technology to the maximum extent possible; (c) focusing on the development of form factors based on well-defined standards to support lead platform integration; and\n          (d) implementing a proactive, collaborative MGUE platform integration activity to mitigate risk and reduce cost for DoD force structure modernization.\n          \n          The MGUE program awarded three sole source contracts for the Inc 1 Technology Development Phase effort in September 2012, as follow-on efforts to the competitively awarded Modernized User Equipment (MUE) contracts awarded in June 2006. The effort spans the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase through design and includes integration and test of M-Code receivers into Service-nominated lead platforms. This effort also includes the security and compatibility certification of GPS receiver cards as a part of the integration effort. The Service lead platforms will select from the available vendors to integrate and perform operational testing with funding from the MGUE program. This supports compliance with PL 111-383, section 913.\n          \n          The MGUE Inc 2 program developed an Acquisition Strategy to continue MGUE development by:  addressing long term producibility of MGUE ASICs, identifying a U.S. owned trusted foundry for ASIC development, delivering GPS receiver cards to meet stringent Inc 2 requirements, and developing a modernized GPS handheld receiver to meet the needs of the Services.  The MGUE Inc 2 program is being executed in three parts:  1) Risk Reduction Activities, 2) MSI Middle Tier Acquisition  rapid prototyping, and 3) Joint Modernized GPS Handheld Receiver Middle Tier Acquisition rapid prototyping effort.  The Air Force Service Acquisition Executive approved the MGUE Inc 2 Acquisition Strategy to include designation of two Middle Tier Acquisition Rapid Prototype efforts: 1) Miniature Serial Interface Receiver Card (includes next-generation ASIC) and 2) Joint, Modernized Handheld Receiver."

Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) Support was established in accordance with 10 USC Sec 2508 Industrial Base Fund direction to strengthen the posture of the U.S. Defense Manufacturing and Industrial Base to respond at will in support of the Warfighter today and tomorrow.  The IBAS Program provides the Department with a unique capability to achieve the strategic aims of the 2018 National Defense Strategy calling for a strong, resilient, responsive and healthy U.S. Industrial Base (IB) that underpins current and future U.S. force readiness.  This program is uniquely positioned to improve the U.S. Industrial Base\u2019s competitiveness and ability to respond to the Department\u2019s needs by applying focused investments to 1) monitor and assess the current state of the IB, 2) address critical issues in the IB relating to Urgent Operational Needs, 3) address supply chain vulnerabilities, and 4) support efforts to expand the Industrial Base.\n\nManufacturing dominance underpins technical dominance. IBAS is fundamental to achieving a modern IB that integrates traditional and emerging sectors to be able to respond at will to National Security Requirements. A healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains are essential to the economic strength and national security of the United States.  The ability of the United States to maintain readiness, and to surge and sustain in response to an emergency, directly relates to the capacity, capabilities, and resiliency of our manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains. \n \nIBAS investments focus on addressing Industrial Base issues that support defense needs by identifying and closing gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and creating and sustaining reliable sources. Key areas of IBAS investment will include:1) Continue advancement and sustainment of both traditional and emerging defense manufacturing sectors; 2) Continue preservation of critical and unique manufacturing and design skills; 3) Continue the support and expansion of reliable sources; and 4) Continue Identification and mitigation of supply chain vulnerabilities\n\nThe IBAS program has a multi-pronged approach to identify projects: 1) assessments of the national technology and industrial base by the OUSD Acquisition & Sustainment (A&S), Office of Industrial Policy (INDPOL) as directed by 10 U.S. Code 2505, 2) working directly in partnership with defense programs, and 3) working directly with industry. INDPOL collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the Title 10 USC Section 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base critical to a healthy and resilient defense industrial base in order to address:  1) Gaps in national-security-related domestic manufacturing capabilities;  2) Threatened, single, or sole source capabilities especially within the lower tiers;  3) Foreign Dependency from high risk sources or countries; and  4) Education and manufacturing workforce skills needs\n\nFY 2020 and beyond investment strategies will also be informed by findings from 1) Executive Order (EO) 13806 report, \"Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States\" and 2) follow-on industrial base and technology assessments. The EO assessment identified nearly 300 risks across 16 sectors; concludes the current state and trajectory of the U.S. industrial base and our capacity to support readiness is in question; and requires significant changes including increased investment for the industrial base.\n\nCornerstone Other Transaction Agreement (OTA): Enhanced efficiency of IBAS program execution will be supported by a new non-Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) OTA procurement vehicle called Cornerstone, established in February 2018 in partnership between the Office of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense ODASD (Industrial Policy) and the Army Futures Command, Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Chemical Biological Center (CBC). Cornerstone was specifically designed for industrial base investments to meet the Departments needs to improve readiness and sustainment through proactive engagement and investment within and across supply chains. Cornerstone provides the ability to access 19 different industry sectors under one agreement where all parties have agreed to one common management agreement and one intellectual property agreement, and it allows the Government to open or direct solicit tasks as legally appropriate against OTA statues. Cornerstone\u2019s period of performance is \u201cin perpetuity\u201d with no overall ceiling, with task award ceilings. IBAS authorities coupled with Cornerstone enable the department to efficiently execute IBAS investments \u2013 positioning the industrial base to modernize at pace with our military."

Lack of awareness and prestige of the career opportunities stifled potential candidates from entering. Surging defense production budgets concurrent with rising U.S. manufacturing are placing significant pressures on states and companies to increase entrants and accelerate development.  Specialty defense skills such as those related to ship construction and precision optics are highly constrained.  The focus in FY 2019 is to coalesce past and ongoing workforce development efforts for engineering and trade skills into a structured framework to elevate the prestige of and need for the technical skills; accelerate entrants into the technical skills, and comprehensively accelerate training for the technical skills. . This FY 2019 initiative shall coalesce prior projects, Manufacturing Skills Challenge and ELEV8 Supply Chain Resiliency, and expand into precision optics and additional shipyard trade skills, into an industrial base enterprise level.\n\nSpecific Efforts:\nManufacturing Skills Challenge (MSC). This effort was initiated in prior years, and continues into FY 2020. MSC project description is addressed below for FY 2020 Plans."

Similar to broad-based Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) efforts, MSC is comprised of an expanding set of competitions that will help prototype longer-term development of manufacturing training and education models that: 1) promote the prestige of manufacturing and inspire individuals, 2) can be regionally and nationally integrated, 3) close critical gaps in industrial capabilities, and 4) ultimately increase industrial base and defense readiness.  The efforts funded with FY 2017, FY 2018 and FY 2020 resources focused on the welding, metrology, machining workforce in regional corridors with defense supply chains including Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, Illinois, New York, Texas, Virginia, and Tennessee where large ship, aerospace, and automotive growth have created serious workforce skills and supply chain challenges. This effort includes competitions with \"support for a prize.\u201d FY 2020 focused on completing state- and invitational-level competitions, hosting four regional competitions, and concluding with a national championship.\n\n2) Radars, Sensors and Electronics Sector:\n2a) Radar Affordability: This is a continuing multi-year effort started in 2016. FY 2020 focuses on harmonizing cross-service system requirements and creating detailed system engineering models within the open and modular architectures to enable the DoD to leverage small to medium size companies in defense and in adjacent industrial markets to improve overall DoD radar supplier resiliency. \n\n2b) Unmanned Systems Affordability :  Continues effort initiated in FY 2018. Establish efforts that will develop and assure open and modular product architectures for Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optic (EO), and Infrared (IR) sensors, and for power and electric propulsion systems in UAS systems\/platforms.  \n \n2c) Directed Energy (DE) Supply Chain Assurance: Continued efforts initiated in FY 2018. Convene cross-service working group to identify supply chain requirements for meeting service program milestone requirements, assessing and prioritizing risks for mitigation strategies. \n\n3) Materials Sector\n3a) Boron Carbide: Continue efforts initiated in FY 2019 to: 1) develop a United States (U.S.) source; 2) qualify the U.S. B4C material into a program of record (body armor); 3) develop a second U.S. source to provide competition and surge capability; and 4) to begin systematically qualifying both U.S. sources across multiple systems.\n\n3b) Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREE) Supply Chain Resiliency. Continue efforts initiated in FY 2019 as an emergent requirement, not addressed in PB 2020. Executive Orders (E.O.) 13806 and 13817 identified critical materials such as rare earths and components reliant upon rare earths as potential strategic vulnerabilities to the DoD and U.S. Commercial industrial bases. Currently, China has a near global monopoly on rare earths. This initiative is a critical element within the DoD\u2019s broader rare earths supply chain risk mitigation plan. It aligns with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Materials and OSD assessment on HREE. The overall strategy is a systems engineering approach to systematically identify and mitigate risks within the rare earth supply chain and further develop domestic HREE manufacturing processes, ensuring critical component availability and continuity across the material lifecycle. FY2020 assessed Phase 0 studies for viability of domestic capability.  \n\n4) Munitions Sector\n4a) Fuze Initiatives:  Continues program management and oversight of Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD) multi-year efforts initiated in FY 2015 and still in FY 2019 contract execution to mitigate a supply chain loss caused by a reduction in non-DoD demand."

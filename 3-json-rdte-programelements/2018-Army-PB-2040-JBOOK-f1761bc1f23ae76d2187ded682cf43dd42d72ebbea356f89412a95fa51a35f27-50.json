All radios awarded a contract will be required to go through the Qualification Test (QT) to qualify for a Customer Test (CT). Following CT there will be a Field Based Risk Reduction Test (FBRR) that will serve as risk reduction event prior to Operational Test (OT) to ensure the radio is operational at full capability and ready to be used by soldiers. The QT and CT will be executed by Electronic Proving Ground and will serve as risk reduction events prior to the OT as opposed to developmental test to support incremental system improvement.\n\nThe QT will validate the manufacturer\u2019s ability to meet the minimum functional requirements identified in the Performance Requirements Document. Radios that successfully demonstrate key capabilities during QT will proceed to the CT.  The CT will serve as a risk reduction event for FBRR as data from this event will be considered for manufacturer down-select and an initial buy decision. FBRR will serve as a risk reduction event for delayed thresholds and OT.\nThe OT will include support from Army and DoD operational testers and will use communication scenarios based on the Operational Mode Summary \/ Mission Profile of the system(s) under test. The OT will be designed to validate that HMS products meets the users\u2019 needs in terms of effectiveness, suitability and survivability in an operationally realistic environment. Results from OT will facilitate the delivery orders for Full Rate Production."

The RR provides one-channel secure voice and data communications using Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). It is the primary squad level communication system. The LR is a Multiband two-channel handheld radio to be used at the Team, Squad, and Platoon level. The LR will simultaneously support Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice interoperability and SRW data and voice communications in one radio with both handheld and mounted configurations.\n\nOn 13 September 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined to decrease the Basis of Issue (BOI) for the single channel Rifleman Radio (RR), increase the BOI for the two channel Leader Radio (LR) and move forward with acquisition activities for the two channel LR.

On 13 September 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined to decrease the Basis of Issue (BOI) for the single channel Rifleman Radio (RR), increase the BOI for the two channel Leader Radio (LR) and move forward with acquisition activities for the two channel LR. Single channel RR procurement is being deferred however the contractual vehicles still exist.   \n\nHMS is in the process of amending the currently approved acquisition strategy to include the two channel LR. The intent is to continue the multi-vendor approach utilizing the existing IDIQ RR base contract (awarded 29 April 2015) and lessons learned to award the LR competitive contracts. The LR effort will be a separate competition under the Handheld radio suite.\n\nThe LR will simultaneously run the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) - Army managed waveforms.\n\nThe Army will award Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts and will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:\na. Award FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (4QFY17)\nb. Award initial delivery orders based on Qualification Test results (3QFY18)\nc. Award FRP delivery orders based on Operational Test and best value trade off construct (3QFY19)"

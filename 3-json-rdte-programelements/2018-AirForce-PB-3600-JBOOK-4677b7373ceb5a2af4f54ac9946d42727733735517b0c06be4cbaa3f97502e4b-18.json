Aerial Targets provide adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366 \"Live Fire\/Lethality\" developmental\/operational test requirements.  Targets are used to validate operational missile\/weapon system effectiveness and fighter Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates.  Targets are essential for development testing\/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, and F-15, aircraft.  The objective is to provide realistic targets for missile testing to enable the development of offensive counter-air systems (air-to-air and surface-to-air) capable of defeating changing enemy airborne threats. This program element funds development, improvements, and updates of full-scale\/subscale aerial targets and target control systems to ensure aerial targets represent enemy threat airborne systems.  Specialized target payload subsystems are developed for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack, electronic countermeasures and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems.\n\nThis program is in budget activity 7 - Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year."

The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of launch phase performance and overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. \n\nElectronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales and full-scales to realistically emulate foreign threat systems in support of weapons testing.  \n\nTCS provides a myriad of sub-systems that together delivers the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full-scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, all the while assuring the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service T&E demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems."

Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  The Aerial Targets program provides targets to satisfy \"Live Fire\/Lethality\" developmental\/operational test requirements.  Targets are used to validate operational missile\/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental\/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, and F-15, aircraft.   The United States Air Force's (USAF) Air Superiority Modernization\/Mission Area Plan has identified aerial targets as a capability shortfall; the QF-16 program will fulfill this requirement.  Funding supports continued development of the follow-on full-scale aerial target (QF-16) and simulators, development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD."

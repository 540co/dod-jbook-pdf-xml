In addition, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3910 (FFT Operations Guidance) directs USSTRATCOM's ASCC to execute eight specified FFT mission support responsibilities that include providing a testing and development capability to support joint, interagency and coalition partners FFT operations.  USASMDC\/ARSTRAT: Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for space, the Army integrator for global missile defense (GMD), and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the USSTRATCOM. Army Regulation (AR) 10-87, Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007, and AR 5-22, The Army Force Modernization Proponent System, dated 19 August 2009, designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Space\/High Altitude capabilities. As the Army proponent for space and high altitude, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions.\n\nProject FE5 funds USASMDC\/ARSTRAT efforts to develop, analyze and mature warfighting concepts, and conduct warfighting experiments for space and high altitude capabilities. USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is the proponent for space\/high altitude capabilities and is responsible for determining and integrating DOTMLPF-P for the Army.  The program also funds development and integration of new data sources and services into the JFFT Mission Management Center (MMC), providing users FFT information system services at the highest Mission Assurance Category level (MAC 1). Software products developed and deployed by the JFFT Testbed into the MMC enable the receipt, integration and dissemination of real-time FFT information to the Common Operating Picture (COP) displays for Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Forces and coalition partners.  JFFT Subject Matter Expert support to critical FFT interoperability assessments and development activities with coalition partners are supporting DOD's priority of strong alliances and partnerships.  Integrated FFT data solutions developed by JFFT Testbed enable FFT data for COP display and Situational Awareness between Army forces and Unified Action Partners.  The JFFT Testbed will continues to leverage FFT systems expertise and reduce Department of Defense costs by supporting numerous efforts, including the joint Personnel Recovery community response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to resolve critical issues in isolated persons reporting and locating."

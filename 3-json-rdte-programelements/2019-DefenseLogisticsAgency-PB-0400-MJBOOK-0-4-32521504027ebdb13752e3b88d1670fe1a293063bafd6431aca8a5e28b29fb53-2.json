                            "val": "Prior Years includes:\n-Capabilities Based Logistics: $7.342M. The Department requires procedures and technologies which provide enterprise-level capabilities critical to the distribution system to improve performance of the end-to-end DOD supply chain in direct support of the full range of military operations.  Ability to rapidly respond to customers\u2019 changing demands, with a reliably high level of service.  These needs include: capabilities which enhance any supply or transportation mission (aeromedical, air refueling, joint logistics over-the-shore, and seabasing); analysis, tailoring and implementation of selected best enterprise-level practices from industry; and tools\/procedures to optimize transportation plus supply (distribution) plans and schedules in support of an entire operation.  This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of capability-based logistics.\n\n-Deployment and Distribution Velocity Management: $6.869M. DOD requires procedures\/technologies targeted at optimizing throughput at the nodes and through the conduits of the deployment and distribution supply chains, from origin to point of use and return to include: inventory management enhancers (includes node cargo management\/tracking); materiel handling innovations (including methods of reducing handling); improved physical access to nodes (includes aircraft all-weather visual systems); port throughput enhancements (includes in-port time reduction methods); and innovative delivery methods (for example, precision airlift, autonomous re-supply).  This project addresses required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers of DOD\u2019s distribution and transportation systems in the area of deployment\/distribution velocity management.\n\n-Cross Domain Intuitive Planning: $2.408M. Procedures\/technologies which improve decision-making and collaboration within the supply chain, from the planning stage to real-time execution and retrograde operations, without need for highly specialized operators of the tools.  Projects in this area address following areas: decision support tools for any echelon of the supply chain or decision-maker, distribution process simulations and models for analysis and training, distribution demand forecasting\/execution monitoring tools, on-line training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, recommended courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  This project will provide required mission support to combatant commanders and other distribution\/transportation customers in the area of collaborative planning\/execution\/information sharing\/decision support tools.\n\n-End-to-End Visibility: $7.039M. Enhanced end-to-end visibility of all aspects of power projection\/sustainment spectrum is required to improve the effectiveness\/efficiency of deployment\/distribution\/redeployment operations to ensure warfighter support and confidence.  This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)\/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and\/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility, enhance planning\/execution, and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process\/system architecture which will integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DoD cargo during humanitarian\/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and\/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Additionally need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DoD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion\/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.\n\n-Distribution Planning and Forecasting: $8.504M. There is a lack of collaborative distribution planning, based on an understanding of aggregated customer requirements, for optimizing the end-to-end distribution process. Planning, forecasting and collaboration are insufficiently advanced to fully synchronize people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools should be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Project investigates the need for flexible end-to-end enhanced modeling and simulation and collaborative decision support tools.\n\n-Joint Transportation Interface: $14.917M. Synchronizing strategic\/theater delivery capabilities to meet increasingly dynamic customer needs.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro\/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct \"what -if\" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset\u2019s course, speed or departure\/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery\/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and\/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion\/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.\n\n-Distribution Protection\/Safety\/Security: $15.135M. The Theater Commander has not always been able to provide the appropriate security in a timely manner during deployment.  In some cases there are insufficient security assets to oversee convoy security in-country; therefore, all movement requirements are competing for the same limited resources.  Additionally need to explore new, portable methods of detecting hazardous\/asymmetric materials in very small quantities to support safe logistics operations.  Also explore technologies to enhance the capability to deliver personnel\/materiel to anti-access\/austere airfields and seaports."

            "val": "SF100 Aviation Systems Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance (TF\/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser; AC-130H\/W\/U and MC-130E\/H\/P, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking; near real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.  \n\nSF200 CV-22 Development\/Test and Evaluation:\nThe CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF\/TA radar best known as Silent Knight Radar (SKR) or APQ-187, provides long-range, night\/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable\/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following\/avoidance radar.  There is a plan to develop a Defensive Weapon System (DWS) that gives a ~360 degree field of fire to suppress\/eliminate enemy targets.  This effort integrates the SOF unique Color Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) with DWS providing necessary capability improvements identified during operational use and interim contract support.\n\nS750 Mission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThe Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. \n\nS875 AC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging\/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following\/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC\/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command\u2019s legacy C-130 fleet.\n\nD615 Rotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and improve aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following\/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC\/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command\u2019s legacy C-130 fleet."

These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters."

An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components to the extent possible and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A\/MH-6M aircraft operational beyond FY 2020 and until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications."

Additionally within the airframe upgrade, there are two sub efforts (new rotor blades\/flight control kits and new integrated airframe shells).  The airframe efforts (new rotor blades\/flight control kits and new shells) will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframes.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item\/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022  MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-unique upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. \n\n\u2022  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in DVE.  A competitive source selection process was conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time \u201csee through\u201d imagery and visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  \n\n\u2022  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   \n\n\u2022  IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A\/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Department of Navy IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The Government will integrate the systems onto the A\/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.   \n\n\u2022  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.\n\n\u2022  MPU - Provides for future cockpit architecture studies that will help define the replacement of current mission and video processors for all ARSOA platforms.  Additionally it will address near term required upgrades to existing components.  Potential upgrades will be through existing OEMs, while the future cockpit architecture studies will be competitively awarded.\n\n\u2022  The ASE Upgrades program develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements\/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment and flares.   For new systems, other services\u2019 development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the OEM.\n\n\u2022  The SRTV project integrates and tests software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time FMV intelligence.  A variety of contracting methods will be used for acquiring test assets, accomplishing SOF-unique modifications and testing to include use of other services\u2019 contracts, competition, sole source awards, and directed efforts of government organizations."

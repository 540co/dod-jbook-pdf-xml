            "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a joint training environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n\n- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Joint Interoperability Division (JID)\n\n- Marine Corps Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n\n- Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)\n\nJNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training to improve interoperability and create realistic tactical and operational joint training.  JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support Services and USSOCOM requirements to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training; and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment.  Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.\n\nJID: Joint Interoperability Division (JID) supports 35 annual schoolhouse interoperability courses and up to six CAPSTONE Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) courses tied to various Combatant Command (CCMD) joint exercises. JID trains CCMD, Services and partner nations' operations center personnel on interoperability planning tasks required during contingencies and exercises in emerging mission areas such as joint fires, net enabled weapons, remotely piloted aircraft, integrated air and missile defense, and contested operations including secure internet with Link-16\/TDL equipped major weapon systems and smart bombs.\n\nMarine Corps JNTC:  These funds provide USMC stability and risk reduction to a variety of ongoing joint efforts focused on improving the fidelity and realism of training simulation systems that prepare Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for deployment in support of CCMD operations.  In support of the Commandant\u2019s planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance and support of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF) Bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  It also provides a single source training environment capability enabling users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, it also enhances pattern of life and indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers' ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into training scenarios. \n\nADL: The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver training and education more efficiently and cost effectively. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. This oversight supports interagency interoperability and promotes personnel readiness, ensuring the right people receive the right training at the right time."

These funds can only be applied to work efforts in the U.S.. The Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Technology and Logistics (USD, AT&L) must approve each international agreement.  The program provides funds for multiple projects under separately approved international agreements as well as funds that support the establishment of such agreements.  Each international agreement is summarized in a separate Summary Statement of Intent (SSOI) that also states why the project serves to increase the defense capabilities of the U.S.  The SSOI is used to obtain project approval by the Department of the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) R&D cooperative programs differ from other Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) programs because issuance of funding from this PE coincides with the signature of international agreements.  These signatures occur throughout the fiscal year and often encounter unexpected delays during the staffing and negotiation phases of agreement processing prior to signature."

The performance goal is met if total foreign contributions into projects exceed total NATO cooperative R&D program funds by over 100%.\n\nThis program historically does not meet established execution benchmarks.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) R&D cooperative programs differ from other Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) programs because issuance of funding from this PE coincides with the signature of international agreements.  These signatures occur throughout the fiscal year and often encounter unexpected delays during the staffing and negotiation phases of agreement processing prior to signature."

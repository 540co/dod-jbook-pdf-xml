                            "val": "The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB & Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for over 170 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts\/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command & control. During FY 2017 the AFSCN supported 14 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $4.97B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. In FY 2017, the AFSCN supported 26 launches delivering $14.2B worth of satellites to their operational orbits. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence Community, and civil users. These efforts support cybersecurity operations and Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) activities as well as align with the evolving future space domain demands through Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG) & Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), to include transmit and receive, data transport, and cyber activities.\n\nRemote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC) - Satellite Anomaly Recovery and Support Upgrade; Enhanced High-Power Amplifier (EHPA): The Air Force will complete development testing of the EHPA first article. The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system. The EHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue through the 2020s.\n\nAFSCN Deficiency Resolution: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.  \n\nElectronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD): The ESD project called AFSCN Scheduling Tool (AST) will allow satellite operators to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas, automatically deconflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish the schedule in real-time to all users.\n\nResilient Enterprise Ground (REG): Provides the means to communicate with all future spacecraft through diverse antenna networks. This effort is a New Start in FY2019.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFSCN weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  BA 7 includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

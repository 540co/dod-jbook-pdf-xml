            "val": "This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) on systems engineering, development planning, program protection, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense (DoD).  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for: (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems, system security, and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance manufacturing, reliability, availability, maintainability, and software and hardware assurance, on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs) and major automated information systems (MAISs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) and program protection plans (PPPs) for MDAPs and MAISs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering, assurance and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) develops new methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) incorporating state of the practice into system engineering for the DoD in both weapon system design, and design tools.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP and PPP for each MDAP and MAIS, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering, program protection, and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  Based on the DASD(SE)\u2019s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense regarding systems engineering, development planning, program protection and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program\u2019s systems engineering, development planning, program protection planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.\n\nThe DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering across the Department.  The DASD(SE) improves DoD\u2019s SE capabilities through advocacy, oversight, policy, and guidance for the acquisition workforce responsible for Engineering, and Production, Quality & Manufacturing (PQM); in Engineering Tools and Environments; and in Specialty Engineering.  \n\nThe DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  The DASD(SE) prepares and submits a bi-annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.\n\nThis PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department\u2019s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of the DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews.\n\nBeginning in FY 2019, this PE will support activities to carry out responsibilities described in Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 855 titled Mission Integration Management (MIM)."

Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drives the need for diligent program protection planning and execution.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor networks; improve mitigation of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks."

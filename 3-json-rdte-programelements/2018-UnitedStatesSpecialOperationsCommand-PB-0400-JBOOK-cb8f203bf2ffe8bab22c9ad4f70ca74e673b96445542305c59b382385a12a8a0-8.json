                            "val": "This sub-project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Special Operations Tactical Video System\/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (TVS\/RSTA);  Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).\n\nU.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    \n\nOPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    \n\n\u2022   NSSS.  This program provides research and development and rapid prototyping as the HQ SOCOM Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by leveraging National Geospatial-Intelligence (NGA) and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units to include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid development, fielding and deployment, and focus on transitioning to SOCOM Programs of Records (POR). These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM\u2019s existing Military Intelligence Programs.  Focus items include:  Small Unmanned Aircraft System Multi-Intelligence geo-location and targeting capabilities with a Rapid Reliable Targeting system that supports NGA CAT1 level targeting, enhanced GEOINT processing capabilities by fusing Light Detection and Ranging with National Technical Means (NTM) and the Enhanced Image Rendering Tool, which allows sharing of NTM Imagery with coalition forces.  NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM\u2019s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automate radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.\n\n\u2022   JTWS.  The JTWS System of Systems (SoS) enables the SOF Cryptologic Operator to collect, process, locate and exploit threat communications signals of interest in order to provide timely, relevant, and responsive intelligence, cross-cueing, and threat avoidance information directly to the SOF Commanders.  The JTWS SoS is assembled in four variants: Ground SIGINT Kit; Maritime; Air; and Unmanned Aerial Systems.  Each variant has additional requirements for Communications Intelligence, Electronic Intelligence, and Precision Geo-location.\n\n\u2022   HF-TTL.  This program utilizes a commodity procurement strategy to provide SOF warfighters with the necessary tools to find, fix, and finish terrorist networks through the emplacement of sophisticated tags and devices that feed into an integrated architecture.  HF-TTL provides Global Combatant Commanders (GCC) and SOF operators with an immediate capability to tag, track, and locate people, things, and activities.  The HF-TTL program provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners.  The mission sets comprise a mix of different classes of tags and their associated detection, interrogation, viewing, tracking, and communications systems that are fielded annually to SOF Components and TSOC based upon dynamic and emergent SOF operational requirements.  \n\n\u2022  TVS\/RSTA.  This program provides SOF with critical Special Reconnaissance (SR) equipment that directly supports the planning and execution of SOF missions.  This capability allows the SOF warfighter to meet SOF SR mission requirements to find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate information of an adversary\u2019s movement, construct, identification, location; and associated things and activities.  TVS\/RSTA provides GCC and SOF operators with an immediate capability to visually and electronically acquire people, things, and activities and provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners and Commanders.  The program Family of Systems (FoS) consists of interoperable equipment to capture and transfer near-real-time ground-based, tactical day\/night\/reduced visibility, imagery, video, and electronic proximity and movement sensing, all capable of dissemination through SOF organic, global C4I, and commercial communications infrastructures.\n\nABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON) \n\n\u2022 SOFPREP.  This program serves as the intelligence focal point for production of SOF enhanced GEOINT (maps, imagery, and terrain data) and 3D scene visualization databases. SOFPREP gathers, processes, exploits, disseminates, and manages classified high resolution 3D databases and GEOINT data in support of SOF training, mission rehearsal, and execution preparation systems. The program builds the SOF common geospatial environment and manages the authoritative database of SOF-specific GEOINT terrain data.  SOFPREP is a NGA-certified co-producer in support of time-sensitive SOF specific requirements. \n\n\u2022   ISP.  This program collects and produces current, detailed, tactical planning data to support military operations to counter threats against U.S. citizens, interests, and property located both domestically and overseas. ISP products are specifically tailored packages that provide operational information, as well as intelligence data for use by DOD and the U.S. Department of State to support operational planners for counter-terrorism operations, evacuations, and other rescue missions.\n\n\u2022   SSE.  This program provides the capability to exploit personnel, documents, electronic data, material, and forensic evidence on sensitive sites\/objectives.  Biometric kits allow collection and transmission of unique, measurable biometric signatures from personnel, including live\/latent fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features.  It also provides a means to verify against and enroll subjects into the DOD authoritative database, and to query that database to support hold or release decisions. Forensic kits enable on-objective linking of events to specific persons through chemical analysis, latent fingerprints, cell phones and computer data analysis, and deoxyribonucleic acid collection. Exploitation Analysis Centers provide theater-level mobile forensic capabilities for more in-depth exploitation of captured evidence."

Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects\/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project\/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR\/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project\/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.\n\nThe NMCS met all FY 2016 performance metrics and is on track to meet its FY 2017 and FY 2018 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within\nallocated resources 100% of the time."

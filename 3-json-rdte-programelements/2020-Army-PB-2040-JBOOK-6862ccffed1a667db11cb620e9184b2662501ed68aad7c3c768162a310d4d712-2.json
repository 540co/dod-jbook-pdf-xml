The Reagan Test Site with its remote location and one of kind instrumentation systems provides a strategic test environment that cannot be replicated. In order to continue its critical mission of testing missile systems that are of paramount importance to the defense of the nation, the RTS instrumentation systems must be continuously updated and upgraded to support the emerging technologies being developed by the DoD such as hypersonics and other advanced weapons systems. Without modernization these instrumentation systems face obsolescence or degraded capability and the inability to provide the critical data needed for continued materiel development. Without instrumentation on par with the technologies being utilized in emerging systems, the materiel developer will be unable to complete their test programs or pass programmatic milestones toward deployment. These funds provide modernization of the radar, telemetry, optics, range safety, communications, command\/control and other equipment essential to meet test and evaluation requirements of the Services and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The RTS instrumentation is required to support data collection for test & evaluation assessments and operational decisions that have strategic implications for the Army, Navy, Air Force, United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other customers. RTS, located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Funding will enable RTS to continue to meet customer objectives and sustain the required instrumentation suite."

In addition, this approach will enable centralized command and control of the telemetry equipment increasing efficiency in mission preparation and execution. The telemetry back-end processing chain is currently comprised of discrete frequency- specific hardware components that are replicated for each telemetry channel required for a test event. This activity will develop a scalable frequency-agnostic, software-based solution that runs on commodity computer servers. More complex missions (e.g., Over-the-air (OTA) operational testing of the Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS)) will continue to require more telemetry channels, but this activity will avoid much of that future cost. This effort will provide enough hardware to increase capacity of the telemetry system."

Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities which include: Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), AZ; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL.\n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total Project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These Projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team. FY20 funds will be used for modernization of outdated instrumentation in support of developmental testing for Army, Department of Defense programs.\n\nElectromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems. This Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items. Nuclear Effects Test Capabilities Modernization acquires and upgrades Special Test Equipment for nuclear facilities located at WSMR. These acquisitions and upgrades include the Pulse Current Injection Simulator, Prompt Gamma Simulator, Gamma Range Facility, Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC), Semi-Conductor Test Lab, Electromagnetic Pulse and the Solar Furnace. Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the Test and Evaluation (T&E) ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users. Test Network Modernization (TNM) will upgrade existing test data networks to ensure infrastructures are capable of providing reliable and secure transport of data and communications for ATEC test activities. Applied Environments Modernization (AEM) program will upgrade antiquated Environmental labs for climatic and dynamic testing with new cascade refrigeration units, climatic chambers, vibration test systems, x-ray cameras, a real-time radiography system and full spectrum solar lights. Future Wireless Network program (FWN) will procure and integrate wireless network technologies across ATEC test activities which will provide near real-time data collection support for Developmental Test and Operational Test events. Robotics\/Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Instrumentation Suite will develop and procure instrumentation for testing controlled and autonomous ground and aerial robotic systems. System of Systems Cooperative Engagement Test Infrastructure (SCETI) will provide for the development of systems to conduct systems-level Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) testing for both aircraft and ground systems in a distributed environment."

Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems. Project focus is to address Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E)-identified Army test realism shortfalls.\n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 million per year or $7.5 million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.\n\nThe DOT&E annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army's abilities to create realistic operational environments. The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE) project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&E. ILTE is a portfolio of related development efforts that will deliver a system of systems to provide a Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) and instrumentation suite that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments. ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan. ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future weapon systems in a realistic operational environment. ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning System (GPS), encryption components, and integrate operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield. Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles. This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs), M1A2 Abrams, M2A4 Bradley, Stryker, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Apache AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2019 funds remaining for obligation in FY20 will be used to complete Block 1 of the Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) in support of PM Apache, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Rifleman Radio. In FY20 operational test instrumentation funding is strategically realigned to Army modernization in support of the National Defense Strategy."

Since existing range radar instrumentation is aged beyond useful life and cannot adequately support emerging test requirements in areas such as hypersonics, the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) develops modern instrumentation radars to replace obsolete tracking and surveillance radars at U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's Developmental Test Command (DTC) activities, which include: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ. The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army with critical testing data essential for the development of next generation technology and advanced system capabilities. The RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability. The planned solution to meet program requirements consists of four primary items: Long Range Single Object Tracking Radars (SOTR), Long Range Multiple Object Tracking Radars (MOTR), Medium Range Radars (MRR), and Short Range Radars (SRR). The resulting systems will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, RTC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers. \n\nThis Project will procure commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and\/or modified commercial off-the-shelf (MOTS) radars for both the MRR and SRR solutions, and a combination of recapitalization and COTS\/MOTS replacement for the FPS-16 Long Range Radars (LRR). Also, the program will conduct Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for upgrading three MPS-39 Long Range MOTRs.\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 request of $94.760 million continues procurement of MRRs and LRRs and provides acceptance testing of Medium, Long, and MPS-39 MOTR radars. The significant increase in requested program funding from FY 2019 to FY 2020 procures seven additional radars, accelerating the program by one year. This strategic acceleration aligns RRRP with developmental testing requirements emerging from Army Modernization efforts in support of the National Defense Strategy."

This capability is comprised of an ATD system built for the Title 10 LFT&E environment and associated biomechanics data and analysis tools. The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with underbody blast (UBB) events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment devices are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for Under Body Blast (UBB) events. The device produced by this Project will be used to satisfy a critical need for scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB."

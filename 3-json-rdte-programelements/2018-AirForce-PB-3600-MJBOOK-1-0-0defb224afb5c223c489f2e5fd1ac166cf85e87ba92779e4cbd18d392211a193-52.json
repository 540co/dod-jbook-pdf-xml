The project also provides an opportunity to quickly insert emerging technologies into existing and developing aircraft munitions and fuzes. Bombs and fuzes provides research, development and testing of conventional warhead, fuzing, and HOBS modifications to improve lethality against area, mobile, and fixed targets, to include anti-personnel anti-materiel (APAM) targets. This project provides for the development and testing necessary to provide a suitable manufacturing base of conventional warheads, fuzes, and HOBS. \n\nMajor thrust areas include:\n\n- Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE): MMHE is a continuing project to develop and improve the standardization and commonality of munitions handling and armament equipment to preclude duplication.  Efforts are primarily the study, design, and development of MMHE and armament control systems; however, support may be provided to other functional areas as requested.  Procurement will be performed and funded by the applicable weapons system project.\n\n- Medium Caliber Ammunition project assesses, refines, and develops medium caliber ammunition, to include, but not limited to, conducting 25mm (F-35) qualification and comparative testing.\n\n- Insensitive Munitions (IM): IM models and validates munition performance, integrates less sensitive explosive fills, addresses IM explosive fill deficiencies, and develops bomb case modifications to improve the response of conventional weapons to unplanned stimuli. Supports AF IM strategic planning to achieve IM compliance IAW U.S. Code, Title 10, Subtitle A, Part N, Chapter 141, Section 2389, ensuring safety regarding insensitive munitions.\n\n- BLU-134\/B Improved Lethality Warhead (ILW): This Next Generation Area Attack Weapon (NGAAW), formerly known as Improved Lethality (IL), continues and expands development planning and legacy warhead efforts to improve lethality against area targets, to include anti-personnel anti-material (APAM) targets. This effort studies, designs, develops and tests warhead and fuzing modifications which improve lethality against APAM while meeting current DoD policy on cluster munitions and unintended harm to civilians. These improvements may be synergistic with maintaining a suitable manufacturing base. This effort was a new start in Project 653133, Bombs & Fuzes, in FY15. \n\n- Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) II Rotary Wing Plus (RW+):  Integrate rotary wing rocket (2.75-inch), M151 warhead (Frag) with a new BAE laser guidance system on A-10\/F-16.  Provide limited envelope capability within 6 months, expand envelope in 14 months, and integrate new M282 warhead (Penetrator). This effort was an approved UON in FY2016, executing FY2015 funding.\n\n- Cockpit-selectable Height-Of-Burst Sensor (C-HOBS): Follow-on development activities for legacy fuzes and HOBS, including reliability enhancements and producibility improvements."

UAI standardizes software interfaces to support integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operational Flight Programs (OFP) cycles.  UAI is currently being implemented on the F-15E, F-16 Block 40\/50 and EPAF(European Participating Air Forces) F-16 aircraft, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Laser JDAM, Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software (PGMPS). Additional aircraft and weapons, including but not limited to, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF\/F-35), B-1, B-52, LRS-B, MQ-9, JASSM-ER, CWDS as well as Army and Navy UAVs and Navy F\/A-18s, have program plans to implement UAI. UNI standardizes software interfaces between the Embedded Global Positioning\/Inertial Navigation System (EGI\/INS) and the aircraft and weapons. The UAI program office is responsible for development and enhancement of the standard (U.S. and allied), support to coalition\/allied\/joint interoperability efforts for weapons-platform interface efforts, provision of certification tools and implementation support to aircraft and weapons."

            "val": "This program develops and demonstrates technologies to support Air Force electronic combat warfighting capabilities. The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace combat, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications. It develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole. It integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding. It develops and demonstrates technologies for navigation and timing in radio frequency (RF)\ncontested and denied environments. It develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for radio frequency electronic combat suites and advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms. It also develops and demonstrates technologies that identify and mitigate avionics system cyber vulnerabilities as well as protects avionics and other critical technologies. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601F, and 0602298F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It develops disruptive electronic warfare and countermeasures concepts specifically selected for high-impact, game-changing effects; evaluates them in high fidelity virtual and hardware evaluation settings; and demonstrates them in an operationally relevant environment.  It establishes and maintains an all-source, physics-based, threat-to-countermeasures electronic warfare systems engineering methodology. It develops a core analytic function, supported by simulation-based wargaming and interactive engineering modeling capabilities to evaluate advanced countermeasures concepts."

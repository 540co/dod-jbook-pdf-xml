            "val": "The Fiscal Year FY 2020 budget estimate request funds the development of Aircraft Avionics systems required to horizontally and vertically integrate the battlefield and the integration of those systems into Army aircraft. Tasks in this Program Element support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.\n\nThe Doppler Global Positioning System Navigation Set (DGNS) Upgrade program completes system engineering trade studies to reduce space, weight, and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as an inertial sensor interface card and Instrument Flight Rules map display. It also prepares Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to the existing DGNS Line Replaceable Units (LRU) as a result of those trade studies. The DGNS upgrade continues with execution of Non-Recurring Engineering for Computer Display Unit (CDU) and Signal Data Converter LRU ECP packages. The DGNS CDU upgrade replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display, provides a moving navigation map capability and optimizes pilot interface to augment existing Instrument Flight Rules capability promoting safer flight operations. The CDU upgrade will support Assured-Position Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) operations in conjunction with additional system LRU upgrades, includes anti-jam antenna capabilities, and supports Department of Defense (DoD) and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations.  This will require assessment and follow-on upgrade to the DGNS navigation system. The CDU upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance and associated PNT capability gaps, and will evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.\n\nThe Enhanced Aviation GATM Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) Navigation System (EAGLE) A-PNT integration program assesses current capabilities in identified operational PNT environment levels, tests identified upgrades to existing EGI hardware in order to accommodate A-PNT in identified operational environments, and incorporates M-Code. It supports DoD and Army's requirement to maintain A-PNT throughout operations and requires assessment and follow-on upgrade to the EGI navigation system. The EAGLE upgrade will perform an assessment of A-PNT assurance levels to understand system performance, associated PNT capability gaps, integrate anti-jam antenna capabilities, and evaluate candidate solutions to cover any identified gaps.\n\nThe Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) program portfolio includes DVE Army Directed Requirement (DR) and Environment Exploitation System (EES).\n\nThe DVE DR is to provide DVE systems to 15 HH-60M Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and 25 Special Operations aircraft. The DVE DR fulfills an immediate DVE requirement while bridging the gap between future DVE capabilities. The DVE DR system provides a forward looking, situational awareness, fused-sensor image for single aircraft takeoff and landing in brownout conditions. The program will complete development and test efforts in support of the DVE DR in FY 2019.\n\nThe EES program focuses on development and maturation of active and passive sensors, synthetic vision, sensor and software data fusion, imagery processing, user interface, and multicore processing technologies to enable current and future fleet capabilities and innovative technical solutions for the current Army aviation fleet to safely operate in DVE. EES will equip Combat Aviation Brigades with evolving modular DVE solutions creating revolutionary tactical advantages while increasing survivability.\n\nThe DVE Increment I Capability Development Document outlining the DVE requirement for the UH-60 and CH-47 to takeoff, land and perform ground taxi operations in brownout conditions was removed from Army staffing in February 2018.\n\nThe Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations, safety, and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons. ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling\/management, risk management, mission approval, and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS) to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations.\n\nThe Improved Data Modem (IDM) is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation and is fielded on every modernized, rotary-wing Army aircraft, including the CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk. The IDM-401 provides the Army rotary-wing fleet with critical communication capabilities, performing as an internet controller and gateway to the Tactical Internet (TI) and Fire Support (FS) internet. The IDM enables connectivity to multiple radios used by rotary-wing aircraft and the Blue Force Tracker transceiver, as well as providing the means for rapid data transfer. The Multi-Core Processor (MCP)-501 modification effort will be a technology replacement for the current Army IDM-401. The MCP-501 will satisfy Army requirements for hardware, software, and firmware and be able to satisfy cybersecurity requirements. The MCP-501 will replace the current IDM-401 with a common server capability to support current and additional IDM-401 functionality that are common among multiple Army Aviation platforms and become a core component of the Digital Backbone for Army rotary wing aircraft.\n\nThe  Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS) is a decision support and battle synchronization system for automated mission planning, risk assessment, and transfer of mission data to aviation platforms in support of Mission Command functions within an Aviation unit. This includes route generation, performance planning, communications planning, terrain analysis, data transfer, and mission rehearsal. It also provides connectivity to Army Mission Command Systems. The AMPS efforts support the advancement of Army Aviation Mission Planning from the legacy Hardware\/Software solution to a mobile, Future Airborne Capability Environment\/Open Architecture conformant, hardware agnostic system. These efforts will include development and testing of a new underlying architecture to support the move of Army Aviation Mission Planning from the current structure to one that supports synchronization both vertically and horizontally between Aviation and Ground forces. It will allow for a modular, multipronged approach to meet the needs of the various planning and execution environments and allow aircrews to continually plan and update route, threat and performance data throughout all phases of an Aviation mission."

Tasks in this Project support research, development, and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.\n\nThe Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations, safety, and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons. ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling\/management, risk management, mission approval, and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS) to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations.\n\nThe Improved Data Modem (IDM) is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation and is fielded on every modernized, rotary-wing Army aircraft, including the CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk. The IDM-401 provides the Army rotary-wing fleet with critical communication capabilities, performing as an internet controller and gateway to the Tactical Internet (TI) and Fire Support (FS) internet. The IDM enables connectivity to multiple radios used by rotary-wing aircraft and the Blue Force Tracker transceiver, as well as providing the means for rapid data transfer. The Multi-Core Processor (MCP)-501 modification effort will be a technology replacement for the current Army IDM-401. The MCP-501 will satisfy Army requirements for hardware, software, and firmware and be able to satisfy cybersecurity requirements. The MCP-501 will replace the current IDM-401 with a common server capability to support current and additional IDM-401 functionality that are common among multiple Army Aviation platforms and become a core component of the Digital Backbone for Army rotary wing aircraft.\n\nThe Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS) is a decision support and battle synchronization system for automated mission planning, risk assessment, and transfer of mission data to aviation platforms in support of Mission Command functions within an Aviation unit. This includes route generation, performance planning, communications planning, terrain analysis, data transfer, and mission rehearsal. It also provides connectivity to Army Mission Command Systems. The AMPS efforts support the advancement of Army Aviation Mission Planning from the legacy Hardware\/Software solution to a mobile, Future Airborne Capability Environment\/Open Architecture conformant, hardware agnostic system.  These efforts will include development and testing of a new underlying architecture to support the move of Army Aviation Mission Planning from the current structure to one that supports synchronization both vertically and horizontally between Aviation and Ground forces.  It will allow for a modular, multipronged approach to meet the needs of the various planning and execution environments and allow aircrews to continually plan and update route, threat and performance data throughout all phases of an Aviation mission. Development of a mobile aircraft performance planning\/weight & balance calculator is currently underway and will be the first migration of AMPS capabilities to a mobile hardware agnostic environment."

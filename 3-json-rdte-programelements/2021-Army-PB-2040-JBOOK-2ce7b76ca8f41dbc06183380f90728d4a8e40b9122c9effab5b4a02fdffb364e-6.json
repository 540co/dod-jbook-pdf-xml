Resources provided by this PE operate six elements of the DoD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB): White Sands Test Center (WSTC) - White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) - Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) - Fort Huachuca, Arizona; Yuma Test Center (YTC) - Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) - Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Centers (TRTC) at various locations. This PE also funds the Army's test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC) - Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.\n\nThis PE finances the overhead (institutional) test operating costs not billable to DoD test customers per DoD Instruction (DoDI) 3200.18 and DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoDFMR) 7000.14-R, which include: recurring test infrastructure\/capability sustainment requirements; replacement of test equipment; test operating procedures; and test revitalization\/upgrade projects to maintain $8.7 Billion of testing capabilities; and improvements to the safety, environmental protection, and efficiency of test operations. The test capabilities at these ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&E) requirements of funded acquisition programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, cyber, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.\n\nThis PE sustains the T&E capabilities required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies. Types of systems scheduled for testing include, but are not limited to: Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier Systems, Missiles, Rockets, Mission Command Network, Tactical Command, Control, and Communications, and Robotics\/Unmanned Autonomous Systems. These T&E capabilities enable AFC modernization efforts and readiness.\n\nSpecific systems supported in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 with continued support in FY 2021 include: 105-mm Mobile Wheeled Howitzer; 30mm\/40mm ammunition; Active Protection System (APS); AH-64 Block III; AN\/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel 3-D Radar; APR-39C(V)1 Radar; Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV); Army Integrated Air-Missile Defense (AIAMD); Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS); CH-47F Chinook; Common Infrared Counter Measures (CIRCM); Common Robotic System-Individual (CRS-I); Counter Unmanned Aircraft System (c-UAS); Counter Rocket Artillery Mortar (C-RAM); Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter System (EHETS)\/Medium Equipment Trailer (MET); Enhanced Night Vision Goggle - Binocular (ENVG-B); Expedient Leader Follower; Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA); Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV); Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS); Hypervelocity Gun Weapon System; Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), Javelin; Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) for US Navy; Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV); Leader Radio; M109A7 Paladin\/M992A3 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV); M1147 Advanced Multi-Purpose X(AMP); M1A2 Abrams SEPv2 Next Evolution Armor (NEA); M-2\/3 Bradley Expedited Active Protection System (ExAPS); M-2\/3 Bradley Fist; M776 Chrome Tube; M777 Long Range Cannon; Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD); Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF); Modular Handgun System (MHS); Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle; Patriot 3 (PAC-3) Precision Guidance Kit (PGK); Precision Strike Missile (PrSM); Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV); Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (TUAS); Squat Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET); Stinger Shelf life Extension Program (SLEP); Stryker; Systems for Assured Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD); and UH-60M Black Hawk."

Costs include sustainment of maintenance contracts for equipment not included in the Army inventory.  This equipment is necessary to secure arms rooms, ammunition, explosives (AA&E) storage facilities at the FBR, and Chem\/Bio surety sites.

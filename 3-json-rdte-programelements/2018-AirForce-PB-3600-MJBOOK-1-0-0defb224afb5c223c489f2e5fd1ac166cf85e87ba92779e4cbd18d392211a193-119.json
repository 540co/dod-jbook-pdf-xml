Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in analyzing and developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. These efforts provide stability in Air Force Acquisition by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, acquisition process improvement analysis, and developing and managing a technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. These efforts provide stability in Air Force Acquisition by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data."

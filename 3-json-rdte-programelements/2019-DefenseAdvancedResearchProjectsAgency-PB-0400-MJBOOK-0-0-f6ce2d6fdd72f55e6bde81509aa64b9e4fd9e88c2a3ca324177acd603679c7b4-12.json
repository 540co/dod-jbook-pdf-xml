            "val": "The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.\n\nThe objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  \n\nThe Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services."

To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications) while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification, as well as tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic replanning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  The RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy."

It will also provide the means to deter escalation of threat, and, if deterrence fails, the ability to destroy enemy combat systems.  The goal of the fight will be to push enemy decision makers beyond loss tolerance before they achieve operational objectives.  Technologies to accomplish this include command, control, & communications (C3) that operate in a contested environment and interoperate with host-nation forces; distributed sensing, including the ability to leverage indigenous information sources; and hybrid effects that include a mix of kinetic, non-kinetic, and information operations capabilities.  A major thrust within the SESU program will be systems architecture and technology to enable manned-unmanned teaming with a focus on C3 and autonomy of the unmanned platforms.

The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program is to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location.  ReACT will achieve this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture.  The key technical challenge is to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  The ReACT system will sense the target's emissions and then optimally configure the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest.  The ReACT technology is planned to transition to the Air Force and Navy."

Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around the ocean basin.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain, maintain, and re-acquire, if lost, an initial location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus trilaterate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy."

This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.

These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operating standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment technologies.  The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to temporarily restore connectivity for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will emphasize early risk reduction with future scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.

Submarines could exploit expanded areas that were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class submarine.

Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.  The Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment.  The program will leverage Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies. Under an existing Memorandum of Agreement, following vehicle integration and initial testing, the program will transition to the Navy."

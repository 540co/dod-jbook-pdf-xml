ESS will meet the requirements for strategic communications and capability gaps identified in the Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the Protected Follow-on for Resiliency (PAFR) Study and the Strategic Tiger Team. The ESS architecture and functionality will be designed in accordance with the United States Strategic Command's signed ESS Concept of Operations and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's validated Capability Development Document (CDD) satisfying the legacy AEHF strategic requirements and mission performance with enhancements for increased resiliency and cybersecurity.\n\nESS will support strategic mission requirements to provide the National Command Authority (NCA) and Combatant Commanders with highly-reliable, secure Military Satellite Communications. ESS will support the forecasted strategic demand in all operational environments and will be compatible with the existing architectures. The ESS system will satisfy emerging requirements using modular open system approaches to support incremental enhancements.\n\nFor more rapid and resilient strategic capability risk reduction, the ESS Program Office is executing its approved Space Segment acquisition strategy that leverages Middle Tier Acquisition authorities from the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 for rapid prototyping, while maintaining the continuity of the AEHF strategic mission that interfaces operationally within the existing architecture.  \n\nActivities for the ESS ground segment acquisition includes evolving and enhancing existing ground segment, space-to-ground segment integration, and modernization in support of Enterprise Ground Services compatibility, in accordance with the acquisition strategies and schedules. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ESS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

A rapid prototyping phase effectively replaces the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase from a traditional acquisition under Department of Defense 5000 series Directives and Instructions. This approach will award up to three contracts in FY2020 to focus on reducing space segment risks with the objective of maximizing ESS demonstrated capability for the payload and other key technologies. An ESS Program Office-led RFP and source selection will determine which space prototyping contractor, via their performance during the rapid prototyping phase, is positioned for the space segment Build, I&T and Delivery follow-on. The space prototyping contractors will be carried through the follow-on (Build, I&T and Delivery) source selection to continue momentum until the follow-on contract is awarded.\n\nReturn on investment from space prototyping will energize the industrial base and increase competition in strategic SATCOM; inject innovative technical, process and integration approaches; burn down risk early and identify\/correct issues as early as possible; and decrease traditional fielding timelines to support a more resilient and responsive architecture against emerging threats. Success in the competitive rapid-prototyping determines and informs follow-on Build, I&T and Delivery.\n\nThe initial Ground Segment Acquisition Strategy was approved by the Program Executive Officer (PEO) in 4th Quarter FY 2019 to begin early technology readiness studies for ESS Phase 1 Mission Planning in FY 2020. Final approval for Mission Planning to begin architectural design and development\/production may require additional approval and authority designation by the MDA. In-Band and Out-of-Band Command and Control studies are underway to best evolve these systems that are currently under sustainment.\n\nA Space Segment Payload ECU acquisition strategy will be delivered to the PEO for approval in FY 2020."

            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 January 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps) to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) S&T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) is the Marine Corps' foundational Capstone Operating Concept that guides capability development, wargaming, and experimentation and this PE. EF 21 aligns with national strategic guidance including the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Military Strategy (NMS), Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), and with Naval strategy in the Department of the Navy's Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower. \n\nEF 21 describes a future Marine Corps ground force that will have cornerstone characteristics of being naval, expeditionary, agile, and lethal. This force will face security environments and threats driven by Complex Terrain (to include informational and human aspects), Technology Proliferation (including precision weapons), Information used as a Weapon, Battles of Electromagnetic Spectrum Signatures, and Increasingly Contested Maritime Domains. The future Marine Corps will be designed to meet those future security environments but needed force characteristics also impose constraints and challenges on required capabilities. An example would be a need to conduct Information Warfare but with systems constrained by size, weight, and power considerations necessary for a naval and expeditionary force. Another example is Marine firepower requirements to be lethal against technologically comparable threat systems but Marine capabilities and weapons constrained by deployment and sustainment challenges of naval shipping and a distributed expeditionary force. These capability constraints and challenges in turn drive unique S&T requirements that define this PE.\n\nS&T projects in this PE enable future force capabilities through advanced technology development to meet Marine needs within the unique constraints described above in the warfighting functional areas of: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver and mobility; force protection; logistics and sustainment; human performance, training, and education; firepower; and Expeditionary Cyber. This PE funds advanced technology development, technology demonstrations, assessment of emerging technologies, experimentation in warfighting concepts, and the Future Naval Capability (FNC) process as means to develop unique Marine future capabilities with new S&T.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system\/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. \n\nIn addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Naval Future Naval Capabilities Program. The USMC Future Naval Capabilities Activity, formerly named Littoral Combat\/Power Projection (LC\/PP), addresses the advanced technology development associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.    The eight Expeditionary Warfighting Areas support the the Technology Maturation  portfolio investment.  The USMC FNCs support the Technology Maturation\/Acquisition Enabler investment."

Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0603673N  Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development, where the Navy's participation in the FNC Program is funded.   The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval Technology Gaps generated by Integrated Process Teams (IPTs) that are co-managed by Navy and the Marine Corps flag\/general officers with representation across the naval research enterprise.  FNC funding is aligned to naval challenges that may be associated with any of the FNC focus areas (i.e., Pillars).  FNCs contain both 6.2 Applied Research and 6.3 Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity (BA) components as technology is matured from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.   \n\nThe FY 2017 to FY 2018 increase in the USMC Future Naval Capabilities Activity is due to realigning funds within the PE for the initiation of the Fuel Efficient Technology Suite and Water Speed Enhancement efforts in FY 2018."

DC, CD&I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for Science and Technology (S&T).  MCWL's Commanding General (CG) is the DC, CD&I designated Proponent of USMC S&T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&T.  The MCWL\/FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.  \n\nThe current MCWL\/FD Campaign Plan addresses how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) called for in the Secretary of the Navy's \"Cooperative Strategy 21\" and the Marine Corps' capstone \"Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21)\" concept, according to the objectives of the Commandant of the Marine Corps' guidance to develop the future Marine Corps Force 2025.  Execution of the MCWL\/FD Campaign Plan results in recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  In support of the Marine Corps' role to provide an ever-ready quick strike force to protect US interests, MCWL\/FD pursues concepts and new capabilities focused on the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The MAGTF is the Marine Corps' doctrinal, task organized, force deployment package.  It consists of four elements:  the Command Element that provides overarching command and control (C2) of the entire force; the Ground Combat Element normally built around a core infantry unit with supporting armor, artillery, and other ground units; the Aviation Combat Element which provides aircraft, air defense, and other aviation functions; and the Logistics Combat Element which consists of combat service support (CSS) elements including medical, supply, and transportation.  Marine Corps Force 2025 also seeks to maximize the employment of electronic, information, and cyber warfare, as well as manned\/unmanned teaming, within each element of the MAGTF.  MCWL\/FD also examines future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment.  MCWL\/FD accomplishes its mission through five subordinate Divisions:  \n\nFutures Assessment Division's (FAD's) mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks. \n\nThe mission of Concepts and Plans (CAP) Division is to:  examine select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges, and Naval warfare and joint\/coalition integration and capabilities, in order to develop Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS to promote development of the emergent Marine Corps force.  CAP is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.\n\nWargaming Division conducts formal wargames to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and identify opportunities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities. \n\nExperiment Division conducts live force concept-based experimentation to facilitate exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  \n\nScience and Technology (S&T) Division conducts investigations and assessments to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL\/FD investigates the relevance to EF21 capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following EF21 derived Thrust Areas:  Command, Control, Communications, and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Autonomy and Robotics; MAGTF Fires; Maneuver; Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy); Expeditionary Medicine; Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW); and Force Protection. \n\nMCWL\/FD investments encompass inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  CSS and Force Protection; MAGTF C4; MAGTF ISR; Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence."

Although this category covers a few small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by MCWL\/FD, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact.  Investments in this activity may be conducted under the Thrust Areas of Expeditionary Logistics, Expeditionary Medicine, Force Protection, or Autonomy and Robotics. \n\nThe FY 2016 to FY 2017 increase in category funding is attributable to a shift in radar technology use (due to lack of technological advances as well as availability), while investigating systems that can identify, neutralize, or destroy unmanned systems.  This realization led to increased costs due to exploring additional\/alternative radar capabilities.  In addition, increased emphasis on logistics enablers, prototype autonomous air delivery technology purchases, and expanded efforts to enable standoff detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) caused funding to increase.  \n\nThe funding increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is primarily attributable to initiation of the integration and experimentation with DARPA-initiated Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) developed technology for a full scale, modular multi-mission unmanned air system (UAS)."

Its objectives are to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly transition advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline, and to provide safe separation and collision avoidance for remotely piloted aircraft.  This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.\n\nFunds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

                            "val": "The purpose of the Imaging and Targeting Support (I&TS) project is to develop, mature, demonstrate, and rapidly transition next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (active and passive systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).\n\nDevelopmental efforts pursued include: improved sensor capabilities such as hyperspectral imagery (HSI), measurement and signature intelligence, polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indication (GMTI), maritime search\/track, Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar, foliage penetration and additional radar, electro-optical, nuclear event detection, and other modalities; increased geolocation accuracy; increased dismount detection capability; advanced sensor data correlation; automated target detection; network centric warfare; and other Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and associated planning and direction; collection; processing and exploitation; analysis and production; and dissemination capabilities. These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.\n\nThe funds in this project are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and on the results of the Airborne Sensors for ISR Analysis of Alternatives, as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.  The program office has the ability to initiate an I&TS project, within the GEOINT Capabilities Working Group (GCWG) construct but outside the normal annual GCWG vetting process, to expedite development and acquisition of urgently needed capabilities for the warfighter.  Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System 2B efforts include, but are not limited to, development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.\n\nTraditional focus areas include, but are not limited to: development, demonstration, and rapid transition of common radar and electro-optical sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Low Frequency SAR, and antenna, Electro-Optical(EO), Infrared (IR), HSI, Low Light, Laser Radar (LADAR), Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and their operational modes (high resolution imagery, Ground and Dismount Moving Target Indication (GMTI\/DMTI), persistent surveillance, wide area motion imagery, Spectral Identification) for multiple airborne platforms, including medium and high altitude platforms; development and demonstration of advanced tactical sensor and associated tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination processing algorithms and tools (automatic registration, automatic and assisted target detection, network centric warfare). Development of integrated multi-sensor capabilities to detect and identify obscured targets; development and implementation of standards (Common GMTI\/DMTI, National Imagery Transmission Format; and monitoring and enhancement of Imagery Intelligence product quality (radar and EO\/IR imagery, GMTI data, and spectral information) and timeliness throughout the image chain (from sensor to user). Development and integration of airborne sensors to support an open systems architecture pod capability. These efforts focus on reducing the find, fix and track elements of the time critical targeting kill-chain timeline while improving operator and decision-maker efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."

C-ABSAA also supports the \"Worldwide Operations\" key performance parameter in larger RPA requirement documents, and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS. Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability set for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis, research, and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs. \n\nOngoing activities include support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives, collaboration with the FAA, NASA, and the other Services to develop national policy and standards, and SAA related studies, analysis, modeling and simulation, flight demonstrations of critical technologies, and program planning and project execution. RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution."

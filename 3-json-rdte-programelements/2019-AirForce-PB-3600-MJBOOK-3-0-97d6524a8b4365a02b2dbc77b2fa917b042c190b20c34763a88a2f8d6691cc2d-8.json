            "val": "Information Systems Security Program - Includes resources, manpower authorizations, necessary facilities and equipment required to perform INFOSEC research and development, to provide INFOSEC services, to procure INFOSEC products required to secure telecommunications and information systems when such products are separately procurable from host systems, and to provide INFOSEC maintenance and support. Also includes costs associated with the protection afforded to telecommunications and information systems which process sensitive data and efforts to ensure authenticity, integrity, and availability of the information and the system.\n\nThe Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance, and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution \/management systems (known as the Key Management Enterprise (KME)). ISSP delivers on rising national, DoD, and AF priorities to address cyber security threats and increasing war-fighter dependence on cyberspace. The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure, collect, process, store, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power in modern, high-tempo, full-spectrum operations. AF Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment protects information such as war-fighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness and ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the war-fighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and\/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and\/or exceptionally grave damage to national security. \n\nThe overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation war-fighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) mandates to address decertifications, new requirements, and end of life issues. NSA's first tenet calls for an AF KME that permits a totally \"man-out-of-the-loop\" electronic crypto key distribution system from the generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU). This eliminates the current key vulnerability of compromise \/interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key. NSA's second tenet requires an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable. This enables more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, lower life cycle costs, and ensured global information grid-compatibility. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, as these budget activities include development efforts, including the AF KME, to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD EKMS Program. AFEKMS, as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME) and in concert with the overarching DoD EKMS program, provides a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material, with users across DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and all AF weapon systems. AFEKMS supports U.S. DoD Information Assurance. Information Assurance emphasizes confidentiality, access control, multi-level secure databases, trusted computing, and information integrity. DoD EKMS has a three-tier hierarchical structure. This tiered structure provides capability to distribute, manage, and account for COMSEC keying material.  Tier 2 installations comprise the local distribution network (COMSEC accounts) and Tier 3 is where keying material is transferred from the EKMS infrastructure to the consumers End Cryptographic Units (ECUs). Additionally, AFEKMS resources provide maintenance\/distribution of AF Communications Security (COMSEC) publications for all AF users. \n\nEKMS improves protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy manual key management systems. EKMS has and continues to greatly accelerate availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission via Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) versus the manual handling and shipping of materials. While the current EKMS level-of-effort is directed at enhancing current and developing systems, the ultimate goal is for it to seamlessly transition to the net-centric DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The AFEKMS Program continues to provide software development to support emerging requirements during the KMI transition period. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as development activities to extend life of the Simple Key Loader to bridge the gap between EKMS and the KMI implementation.\n\nNOTE:  AF KME Software development (e.g., Data Management Device - DMD, Common User Application Software - CUAS, and Simple Key Loader - SKL) is rolled up into Tier 2\/Tier 3 Development. Software upgrades can be bundled and tracked as a unit, thereby allowing less management overhead and more focus on configuration management and control.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

The iApp is designed to meet certification and accreditation requirements and iApp user interface is designed for ease of adoption and minimal user training for EKMS DMD, Consolidated Tier 3 Testing Infrastructure (CETTI) User Application Software (UAS), and Simple Key Loader (SKL). The CERDEC effort develops a replacement KOV-21 Card for current Simple Key Loader (SKL) to extend life of SKL until KMI compatible key loader is available."

In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were also identified and have been replaced or are in the process of being replaced. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements\/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified by device and algorithm in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides this assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Infrastructure (KMI-See PE 0303140F, Project 67523, AF KMI for a full description).  This AF effort supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform to next-generation cryptographic capabilities.  It provides U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision making information in accordance with national and international policy\/standards, the validated operational requirements of the warfighters, and the intelligence communities.  \n\nThe AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and\/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging\/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure, transparent, network-centric capabilities across the cyber domain. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning\/execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the AF Information Network and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.\n\nThe DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy EKMS. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man \"out-of-the-loop\" in the distribution of crypto key materials.\n\nThe AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. This Research and Development effort includes system engineering, development and testing to successfully implement the AF KMI Last Mile architecture as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME). The AF KMI Last Mile is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KMI Last Mile capabilities include as part of the AF KME distribution, management, and loading of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the end cryptographic unit (ECU). It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrate other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KMI Last Mile is currently in the Development Phase. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nIn parallel with AF KMI, DoD and the Services are addressing the need for a new generation of future KMI-aware ECUs that will be capable of direct interaction with the DoD KMI Enterprise, under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative  (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative).  In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. \"Last mile\" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F."

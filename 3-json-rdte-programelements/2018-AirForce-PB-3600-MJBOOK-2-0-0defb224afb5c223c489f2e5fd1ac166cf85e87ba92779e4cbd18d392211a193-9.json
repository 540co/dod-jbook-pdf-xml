                            "val": "B-52 System Improvements - A comprehensive project to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions. To facilitate future capabilities, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other analysis or paper work necessary to establish a program of record.  Additionally, this project may lead to airborne integration experiments or demonstrations of emerging technologies.\n\nCost includes any other analysis or documentation and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 weapon system.  Cost includes Program Management Administration (PMA) costs, centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership.\n\nB-52 System Improvements will encompass the following major aircraft areas but is not limited to the examples given within each area.\n\nAvionics - Offensive and Defensive; Electronic Warfare systems require upgrades to continue to protect the aircraft in the battle space. Radar Modernization is required to ensure the aircraft can perform the mission in today's environment and resolve current mean time between repair issues with legacy radar.  Global Positioning Satellite Interface Unit (GPS-IU) requires replacement due to throughput issues. \n\nB-52 Airspace Compliance - Communication, Navigation and Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) upgrades are required to comply with increasing FAA requirements. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrade to meet FAA mandate for FY20. GPS guidance unit requires upgrade to new military M-Code standard.\n\nSituational Awareness (SA) - upgrades to current SA systems is required to ensure the B-52 maintains battle space awareness of intelligence broadcasts, friendly force locations, enemy forces and any emerging threats within the Area of Responsibility (AOR).  Adaptation of new data links as well as addition of existing links is crucial to the B-52 remaining relevant to the integrated airborne battle space.\n\nWeapons\/Targeting Pod Integration - Improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system. Integrate emerging targeting pods to include optical and radar targeting capabilities.  \n\nCommunications - current UHF communications systems require upgrades due to legacy radios and satellite systems rearing end of life.  Multiple User Objective System (MUOS) satellite deployments will require the B-52 to upgrade legacy UHF radios to remain relevant.  New technology Beyond line of Sight (BLOS) and Line of Sight (LOS) radios are emerging and required on the B-52 to ensure communications continue in the AOR.  Extreme High Frequency (EHF) program required to meet Nuclear Command Authority two way communications.\n\nFlight Systems - current Jet A fuel used freezes at higher temperatures than previous fuel and therefore requires the addition of an internal fuel tank monitoring system to ensure the fuel does not gel and freeze while flying at altitude. In additiona, the B-52 requires a new Environmental Control System (ECS) upgrade to support any new major aircraft modifications. EHF studies have indicated this will be a needed modification for integration depending on the terminal selection.\n\nNuclear Systems - studies, analyzes, and tests aircraft systems' hardness to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons effects, such as Low Level Continuous Wave (LLCW) and High altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Survivability tests.  It upgrades mission critical systems to survive in CBRN environments.\n\nElectronic Flight Bags - require a system for displaying aircrew checklists on a permanent display.  This supports current AF requirements to reduce carry on paper checklists.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.\n\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The B-52 TDL, provides low latency, jam-resistant situation awareness and command and control communications needed to support in-theater operations and missions. This project will consist of integrating an existing off-the-shelf Link 16 terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). The TDL terminal will be fully integrated with CONECT. This Line-Of-Sight (LOS) Link 16 capability allows the warfighter to utilize this capability by maintaining situational awareness, avoiding threats and employing an array of weapons.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the Link-16 upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security requirements (JRE messaging, crypto modernization, etc.) as well as other aircraft upgrades (1760 IWB, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, BSB updates, RMP, Re-Engining, etc) may require study\/support for potential impact to the CONECT and Link-16 system. Funds may be used for Engineering Development Models (EDMs), test, and field terminals.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.\n\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year"

It includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. The 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments.  Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage and consists of two sub increments 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013.  The 1760 Capability Production Document was validated by the AFROC in February 2015.  Development efforts for Increment 1.1 were completed in November 2015 and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) May 2016.\n\nIncrement 1.2 \n\nIncrement 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J).  This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.  Increment 1.2 completed Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in October 2015.  Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in March 2016.  Milestone B approval was granted in April 2016.  An Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) was conducted in May 2016, validating cost and schedule baselines.\n\nUpon completion of JASSM\/ER software development, an interim capability providing for carriage and deployment of no less than 20 JASSM\/ER (8 bay (power 4), 12 external) is planned.  A combined DT\/OT will validate this capability in advance of 1.2 Full System validation.   \n\nAircraft Hardware Development:  Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements, for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft, and two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft. \n\nSoftware Development: Development of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground based JMPS.\n\nCRL Hardware Development: Develops Group A associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (power supply and power distribution box).  One CRL will be modified for Interim and three CRLs will be modified for 1.2 Full using RDT&E funds.\n\nSupport Equipment:  Consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The current inventory of GPS IUs (76 installed on B-52H, plus current supply level of 16), plus 1 in the System Integration Laboratory (SIL), and 2 on Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA)) will be upgraded by Prime Contractor Boeing.  The upgraded LRUs will be replaced using blue-suit installation, using remove-and-replace processes on the flight line (the current maintenance process).\n\nThe GPS IU integrates GPS Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data into navigation, communications, and weapons systems onboard the B-52.  The GPS IU acts as a controller for a MIL-STD-1553 data bus communications path.  The major areas of support include GPS interface control and monitoring, targeting pod functions, navigation displays for the Pilot and Copilot stations, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) control functions.\n\nOriginally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, it is projected to exceed the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load by 2018.  The GPS IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2018.  The upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU.  The modified GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements.\n\nGPS IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.\n\nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.\n\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The APQ-166 system will be increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the current failure rate of the APQ-166 places long-duration missions at risk. This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire radar system. Development, production and installation of new components and systems to replace the legacy equipment; to be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft. RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, off-the-shelf components and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability of the radar system and the capabilities for new missions. This Radar Modernization Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons and to perform mission-essential navigation and weather avoidance functions. In addition, all the applicable training devices which process radar data or represent the radar subsystem must also be modified and upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will affect all three Weapon System Trainers (WST), the WST Training Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), both B-52 Offensive Station Maintenance Trainers (OSMT), and the Bombing-Navigation System Maintenance Trainers (BNSMT). The program will retire the five existing BNMSTs and replace them with three new virtual training devices.\n\nAs the RMP upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security\/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.), increased radar integration (advanced targeting pod, mission planning, crew vehicle interfaces), as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S\/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and\/or support for potential impact to RMP. \n \nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. \n\nFunds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.\n\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year"

B-52 Aircrew Training Devices simulates the necessary visual, motion, and audible cues to provide ground training of Air Force Global Strike Command aircrew members. The B-52 Weapon System Trainer (WST) Air Refueling Upgrade is a comprehensive project that will allow B-52 Aircrew to accomplish credible air refueling training in the simulator, which minimizes the requirement for on-aircraft air refueling training. To facilitate this capability, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA),Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other Analysis or paperwork necessary to establish a program of record. \n \nFunds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nDMSMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.\n\n\nBA7- This project is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

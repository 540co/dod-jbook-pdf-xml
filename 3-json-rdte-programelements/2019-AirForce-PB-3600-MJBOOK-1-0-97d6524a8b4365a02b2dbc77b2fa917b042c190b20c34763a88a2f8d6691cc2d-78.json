                            "val": "The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today. The F-15C continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night \/ under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors). The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft, sophisticated \"double-digit\" anti-aircraft missile systems and other enemy systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. The F-15 Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) will replace the F-15's functionally obsolete self-defense Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) to enhance weapon system situational awareness and survivability against enemy threats. F-15 EPAWSS will also improve reliability and sustainability. F-15 EPAWSS is linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and \/ or phased technology \/ equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability and aircrew training.\n\nThe F-15 EPAWSS upgrade will significantly improve the F-15's capability to autonomously and automatically detect, identify and locate radio frequency (RF) threats as well as provide the ability to deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt and defeat RF and electro-optical \/ infrared (EO \/ IR) threat systems in contested and unplanned operations within highly contested environments through 2040. The F-15 EPAWSS will provide indication, type and position of ground-based RF threats as well as the indication, type and bearing of airborne threats with the situational awareness needed to avoid, engage or negate the threat. The F-15 EPAWSS will prevent RF and IR threat systems from detecting or acquiring accurate targeting information prior to threat engagement to complicate and \/ or negate an enemy threat targeting solution--and effectively counter enemy missiles \/ weapons if adversary threat systems engage and employ weapons against friendly forces--through components such as chaff, flares, decoys \/ angle countermeasures and jamming.    \n\nIncrement 1 replaces the obsolete TEWS.  Increment 2 adds a towed decoy\/angled countermeasure capability. Increment 2 development begins in FY 2021.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 EPAWSS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\"\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, passed Milestone B approval, and has begun engineering and manufacturing development activities. This program element provides funding for the development of the F-15 EPAWSS to address current and future threats."

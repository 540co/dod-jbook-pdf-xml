MDA uses the Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) and the Agency's Achievable Capabilities List (ACL) to prioritize technology investments including Advanced C4ISR. MDA's investments balance the pursuit of promising next generation technology with the need for near-term solutions to enhance existing BMDS capability.\n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

The advanced technology development will include development of target acquisition and discrimination algorithms and assessment of performance.  Performance assessment and transition risk reduction will use modeling, simulation, and online or offline assessment of live tracking opportunities. When ready, technology will transition to appropriate program elements for advanced component development and integration into BMDS X-Band Radars.\n\nThe Radar Sustainment Contract (RSC) will be used for both advanced technology development and for transition of technology to systems. The RSC is an Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract awarded in 2012 to sustain all the BMDS X-Band Radars. The contract provides sustainment of previously developed X-Band radar products, such as: \n-Software maintenance of existing software developed to support the X-Band Radars\n-Models & Simulation - development, maintenance, and verification of high fidelity models, support for war games and exercises, and support for performance assessment events\n-Engineering Services - engineering support for deployed radars to facilitate maintenance efforts which may include but are not limited to hardware obsolescence studies, hardware redesign, technology insertion, and refurbishment efforts\n-BMDS Test Planning, Execution, and Analysis - planning, execution and analysis of BMDS test requirements for previously developed hardware and software in accordance with the MDA Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP)."

This provides integrity and oversight of the BMDS as well as supports MDA in the development and evaluation of technologies that will respond to the changing threat. Additionally, PWS includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation, and provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations.  Other MDA wide costs includes:  physical and technical security; civilian drug testing; audit readiness; the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program; legal services and settlements; travel and agency training; office, equipment, vehicle, and warehouse leases; utilities and base operations; data and unified communications support; supplies and maintenance; materiel and readiness and central property management of equipment; and similar operating expenses. PWS is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the adjusted RDT&E profile (which excludes: 0305103C Cyber Security Initiative, 0603274C Special Programs, 0603913C Israeli Cooperative Program and 0901598C Management Headquarters)."

All MCRCO projects will align to this phased approach. In the Identify Phase the MCRCO undertakes a continuous process of investigation and compiling of technologies, concepts, and prototypes for various capability areas. Activities in this phase include but are not limited to research, war gaming\/lectures\/and external experiment attendance, industry and FFRDC engagements, Innovation Portal Challenges and Forums, gap identification, and emerging technology analysis.  This is also where the MCRCO portfolio of projects are determined and approved for execution.\nIn the Assess Phase the operational assessments are performed by the MCRCO.  These assessments of capability prototypes are categorized by complexity of effort and the perceived time it will take to conduct the assessment.  The Capability Assessment Categories (CAC) are:\nCAC 1 - Non Developmental Capability Prototype - Plug and Play (1-90 days)\nCAC 2 - Integration Capability Prototype -Reconfigure and Play (91-180 days)\nCAC 3 - Developmental Capability Prototype - Develop and Play (181-360 days)\nThe assess phase has three utility focuses that prototypes must demonstrate prior to being assessed: Military Utility, Enabling Competition, and Lifecycle Affordability.\nThe Inform Phase not only provides the results of the assessment event, but it also tracks the performance of the acquisition process.  The goal is to deliver the capability rapidly to support warfighter requirements . It focuses its efforts on measuring the time it takes for key acquisition events to occur. These events include but are not limited to requirements transition, contract award, production, test, and fielding. Other Measure of Effectiveness will focus on costs and rework associated with acquisition process."

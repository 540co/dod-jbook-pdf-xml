            "val": "This program develops and conducts integrated enterprise advanced technology demonstrations in persistent knowledge, awareness, and command & control that provide compelling advantage to the warfighter in kinetic and non-kinetic multi-domain operations for air, space, cyberspace, land, sea and undersea. This program develops multi-domain battlespace awareness capabilities through advanced aerospace sensors\/signals and exploitation algorithms, counter-countermeasures, advanced data handling, multi-domain fusion techniques\/visualization, secure net-enabled architectures and communications\/networks, and operation\/upgrade of the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS). This program develops training, simulation, mission rehearsal and other Airman performance-aiding methods including adaptive Airman-machine\/interface teaming and multisensory fusion. This program develops electronic and cyber warfare capabilities including trusted sensors\/systems, cyber susceptibility discovery and mitigation, and cyber protection\/resiliency. \n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the Secretary of the Air Force in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021,the entirety of Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, is transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603444F, Maui Space Surveillance Systems, and the associated Project\/activities are transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, is transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635325, Mission Effective Performance is transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech. \n\nIn FY 2021, non-Vanguard efforts and activities in Project 635327, Warfighter Interfaces, are transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603203F, Advanced Aerospace Sensors, and the associated Projects are transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. \n\nThe Air Force Science and Technology portfolio will continued to be managed at the Enterprise level by the Air Force Technology Executive Officer, dual-hatted as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Commander, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorates and locations. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 0602298F, and 1206601SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It is designed to apply developed vulnerability discovery, vulnerability mitigation, and cyber protection technology to avionics systems and components and embedded systems. This involves technologies for trusted sensors and trusted systems that deter exploitation of our critical hardware and software. This project aims to develop cyber resilience and protect systems through adaptation of the system to the threat.  It demonstrates these technologies in open and adaptable architectures for system integration in field demonstrations and proves out the technologies through rapid integration of sensors and architectures for technology transition. It integrates research efforts in electronic and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, is transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE Consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and AF Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Project activities include developing multi-function radio-frequency systems including radar and electronic warfare technology and the position and timing information to enable distributed sensing.  Desired warfighting capabilities include the ability to detect concealed targets in difficult background conditions.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology is transferred from PE 0603203F, Advanced Aerospace Sensors, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech, Project 63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and AF Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

This project includes development of software-intensive solutions suitable for cloud-based integration and for development\/operations-like operational environments.  This project develops technology for effective management of online and offline information sources incorporating both constrained and cooperative sensing.  In FY 2020, this project was realigned to better reflect technical areas being emphasized such as autonomy, multi-domain and multi-sensor information processing, leverage of machine learning developments and enterprise-level modeling, simulation and analysis.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 6369DF, Target Attack and Recognition Technology, is transferred from PE 0603203F, Advanced Aerospace Sensors, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech, Project 6369DF, Target Attack and Recognition Technology, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and AF Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located at Wright Patterson Air Base, Ohio. This is a administrative realignment, and not a new start."

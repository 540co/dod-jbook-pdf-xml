            "val": "The MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) research project 534 is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The MIT LL project supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components, and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds nine technology areas.  Note: In FY 2019, the tenth technology area, Cyber Security, Science and Engineering, moved to individual project code 815.\n\nOf the technology areas, there are four core-technology areas:  Advanced Devices; Optical Systems and Technology; Information, Computation and Exploitation Sciences; and Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technologies.  There are four emerging-technology initiatives:  Advanced Materials and Processes; Quantum System Sciences; Biomedical Sciences and Technology; and Autonomous Systems.  There is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. \n\nThese nine technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual efforts in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence, project 535.  The Technical Intelligence project provides global science and technology (S&T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today\u2019s global S&T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW\/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow\u2019s future. The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Cyber Security, Science and Engineering under project code 815, which began in FY 2019.  The Cyber Security, Science and Engineering research project 815 supports innovative research that addresses critical national security problems in cyber. The project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, and algorithms in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD."

Leveraging technology watch and horizon scanning (TW\/HS) tools, and scouting areas of global technology development, the program\u2019s end-state is to inform senior leadership on where best to invest resources in technology areas to maintain or regain global competitive advantage. The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.  Note:  In FY 2018, $5.253 million is being executed for this effort, but erroneously shown under Project code 534."

Ongoing efforts and areas of concentration include: foundational approaches for integrating traditional and cyber domains, tools and methods to compute threat-based cyber metrics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based capabilities supporting cyber analysis and decision making, building trustworthy and resilient mission systems even with untrustworthy components, new cryptographic systems and prototypes, side-channel prevention and exploitation techniques in cyber and cyber-physical systems, and techniques for exploit repurposing. Integral to these efforts are demonstrations of the impact of cyber effects on traditional kinetic systems, the quantitative and repeatable evaluation of prototypes, and deployment of prototype technology to national-level exercises. The cyber security mission area uses Line funding to research new cyber security techniques in anticipation of DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) needs and requirements."

The Combatant Command Intelligence Enterprise Management Support Office (CCI EMSO) is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community (IC) users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. \n\nOUSD(I) and Joint Staff sponsored a capabilities based assessment resulting in an Intelligence System Initial Capability Document (IS-ICD - JROCM 094-16) and a Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Logistics, Policy, Facility (DOTMLPF) Change Request (DCR - JROCM 088-17).  In response OUSD(I) coordinated with the Air Force to create the CCI EMSO, formerly Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology Provisional Program Activity Office (CCIIT PPAO). CCI EMSO is tasked to address these gap areas for the CCMDs.  Budget line enables long term research and evaluation of systems and processes capable of supporting the CCI Enterprise.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community (IC) users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. \n\nOUSD(I) and Joint Staff sponsored a Capabilities Based Assessment resulting in an Intelligence System Initial Capability Document (IS-ICD - JROCM 094-16).  In response OUSD(I) coordinated with the Air Force to create the CCI EMSO, formerly Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology Provisional Program Activity Office (CCIIT PPAO). CCI EMSO is tasked to address these gap areas for the CCMDs.  Budget line enables long term research and evaluation of systems and processes capable of supporting the CCI Enterprise."

To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information, invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success, ensure the viability of our capabilities, and implement a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes as well as the ability to effectively collaborate\/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote the effective\/efficient\/responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources."

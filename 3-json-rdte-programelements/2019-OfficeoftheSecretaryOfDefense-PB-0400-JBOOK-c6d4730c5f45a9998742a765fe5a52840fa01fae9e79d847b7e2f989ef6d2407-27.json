            "val": "The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts experiments designed to develop capabilities in anticipation of emerging adversary threats, while addressing immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  QRSP efforts support the Department\u2019s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by leveraging commercial technologies and acting as an incubator for potentially game-changing capabilities.  This Program Element also supports the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) strategy to address future threats in a more competitive environment with resurgence of near-peer competitors and adversaries who have studied and worked to counter U.S. technological capabilities.  QRSP provides an agile mechanism to affordably counter emerging technological threats, inform the requirements process, and help maintain DoD\u2019s technical superiority, while fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  Funding in this Program Element enables the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)) to anticipate and respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman\u2019s Gap Assessment, USD(R&E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).    \n\nThe QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell support.  Focus areas within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access\/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; target identification and tracking; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; technical risk assessments through wargaming; and, autonomous systems.\n\nThe QRF objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies and accelerate these capabilities to the warfighter.  The QRF program initiates prototyping projects during the execution year to mature technologies critically needed for the CCMDs.  QRF focus areas include anti-access and area denial, broad electronic warfare, and autonomous learning systems for processing and analyzing intelligence streams.  \n \nThe RRF objectives are to develop proof-of-concept prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies, and expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative and affordable concepts and technologies that meet time-sensitive operational needs as identified by CCMDs, military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as advanced algorithms and software intelligence, to enable conceptual prototyping with agile technology insertion.  The program also leverages existing capabilities in our traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      \n\nThe JRAC focus is on responding, in timeframes acceptable to the CCMDs, to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that are submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  To meet these objectives, JRAC leverages contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nThe SMA Cell's objective is to support CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  SMA products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership."

QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.\n\nIn FY 2018 and FY 2019, QRF will continue to identify and fund prototypes and technology demonstrations that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Investments respond to Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities, including the following interest areas: counter anti-access and area denial; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; novel human identification technologies; human-machine collaborative decision making; and, counter-electronic warfare technologies. \n\nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022  Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech: This project successfully developed a speech triage capability to determine if and when there is speech in a captured radio frequency signal.  Once speech has been detected, the prototype can identify speakers, languages, and keywords in real time across multiple channels.  In 2017, this project transitioned to the Naval Air Systems Command Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office (PMA-290) for deployment and follow-on integration on Navy signals intelligence platforms.   \n\u2022  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization: This project developed new Link 16 improvements for increased anti-jam communication performance.  The project also designed a real-time processor that fits into existing radio circuit card slots to increase adoption of the new technology.  Details of this project are classified.  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization transitioned to the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) radio program for integration into the Link 16 baseline system.\n\u2022  CyberPhantom: This project developed fully customizable cyber tools for open network exploitation.  The solution leveraged best practices of the cyber workforce and expanded cyber space capabilities with a unique blend of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software integrated with new customized tools.

Patton uses a holistic approach to identify critical threat precursors as highlighted by warfighters.  In addition, a team of analysts developed a baseline of data feeds that integrated with a set of enhanced visualization tools to help communicate I&W.  As a result, operators have the information required to analyze adversary threat behaviors.  In FY 2017, the project developed, demonstrated, and transitioned the visualization tools to CCMD customers."

It achieves this by anticipating adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responding to new threats and opportunities.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and increase \u2018speed to market\u2019 by providing cost effective capabilities faster than typical acquisition cycles.\n\nIn prior years, RRF supported the development of alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing innovative technologies.   \n\nIn FY 2018 and FY 2019, RRF will continue to provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and developing near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  RRF projects support goals from the new Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering).  The RRF\u2019s current focus areas include: open source data analysis; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization; prototypes for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; additive manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; maritime technologies; and, novel applications of repurposed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) technologies.  Typical RRF projects address these focus areas through a conceptual prototype within 6 to 18 months and for less than $1.000 million.  \n\nRecent success stories and significant transitions of note include:\n\u2022  Advanced File Carver: This project developed a completely new tool that allows the rapid extraction and recovery of files from large data stores such as hard drives.  The Advanced File Carver significantly increased the functionality available to users over comparable GOTS\/COTS competitors while simultaneously increasing performance speed ten-fold.  Additionally, this tool provides capabilities previously unavailable, including the reconstruction of partially overwritten files, and the recovery of digital images whose headers were deleted.  As a GOTS solution, the Department of Defense (DoD) has made this technology available across the Department and to over 15 federal agencies.\n\u2022  Ingres Tactical WiFi: The airborne Ingres system uses active WiFi signals and advanced processing algorithms to provide an accurate geolocation of target devices in dense, electromagnetically congested, urban environments.  Ingres can identify WiFi transmitters, such as a target's phone or laptop, with better than ten meter accuracy from standoff distances.  Ingres is transitioning to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command to perform evaluations in operationally relevant environments.   \n\u2022  Aluminum Start System: This project developed an electric plasma start system for aluminum combustors to replace the standard hydrogen-oxygen pilot-flame ignition system.  Aluminum combustors are an effective alternative to fossil fuel engines that can use sea water instead of air for oxidizer; however, current systems require pressurized hydrogen and oxygen to initiate combustion.  The prototype microwave-powered steam-plasma torch eliminates hydrogen-oxygen start systems and their associated risk.  This effort transitioned to the U.S. Navy for follow-on development and integration into the aluminum combustion power system for large displacement unmanned underwater vehicles.\n\u2022  Bloom: Responding to an emerging operational need, Project Bloom developed a moored buoy capable of long duration surface measurement operations.  The system provides a platform for radio frequency (RF), magnetic, optical, radiological, and chemical sensing on a standardized and easy to deploy buoy.  The Bloom buoy includes an internal winch capable of submerging it for \"sleep\" periods and to avoid approaching craft.  The operational prototype was deployed to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility and transitioned."

Due to increased speed from design to prototype, reduced cost, and reduced waste, additive manufacturing provides a unique supporting capability for maintaining a U.S. competitive advantage.  This focus area will leverage swiftly-developing commercial innovation and emerging capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia to develop conceptual prototypes focused on warfighter needs.  Projects include spare part replacement, jet engine repair, custom hardware enclosures, and three-dimensional (3-D) models.  Projects have the potential to significantly improve supply chain efficiencies by storing parts as software and manufacturing on demand, and by using rapid prototyping to reduce the time and cost of design.  Projects can also reduce amount of labor required to produce functioning prototypes.  Projects will also investigate security of additive manufacturing technologies and digital schematics.

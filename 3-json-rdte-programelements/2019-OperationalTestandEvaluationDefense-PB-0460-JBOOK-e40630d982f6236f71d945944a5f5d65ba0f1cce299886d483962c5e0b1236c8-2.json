            "val": "The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).\n\nJoint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.   \n\nThreat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  Threat Systems provides DOT&E assessment officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.\n\nThe Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) T&E Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure\/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), weapon system developers, and the Services.  The Center\u2019s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM\/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The Center develops unique CM\/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines effectiveness of precision guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs.  Analysis and recommendations on CM\/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&E, DASD (DT&E), and the Services.  The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM\/CCM technology and capabilities.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds."

Threat Systems will:\n\n- Provide intelligence support to DOT&E staff to address specific questions on threat systems affecting programs on the OSD T&E Oversight list and provide briefings and special intelligence reports when necessary.\n- Provide DOT&E representative support at the Threat Steering Group (TSG) in the transitioning of the System Threat Assessment Reports (STARS) to the new Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) report process.\n- Continue to represent DOT&E interests on Acquisition\/Intelligence\/ Requirement Task Force (AIRTF) and Executive Steering Group (AIRESG) and provide access to the Intelligence Mission Data Management Analysis & Reporting System (IMARS).  \n- Support the US warfighter by providing threat intelligence to ensure operational and developmental testing occurs against realistic threat representations.\n- Sustain and manage threat M&S to support test and evaluation by overseeing and coordinating intelligence community developed threat models, performing threat model anomaly resolution resolving differences from live fire testing, integrating threat models into T&E facilities and distributing performance and signature models to T&E users.\n- Review validation reports to independently ensure that correct threat data and critical parameters are presented in the report to assessment the threat representation\u2019s capabilities to replicate a real world threat system.\n- Continue identifying initiatives to improve cyberspace threat representation and prediction, cyber-economic threats to DoD systems, representative threat offensive and defensive cyber operations capabilities, and scalable cyberspace threat test environments that can interface with cyber test networks.\n- Manage Integrated Technical Evaluation and Analysis of Multiple Sources (ITEAMS) efforts supporting programs on the OSD T&E Oversight List by conducting intelligence \u201cdeep dives\u201d to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets.\n- Initiate new ITEAMS efforts leading to the development of new threat systems for T&E.\n- Represent DOT&E at foreign material exchanges, inter-agency coordinating groups, and non-proliferation groups to raise awareness of T&E needs for foreign material, coordinate service requirements, and de-conflict and prioritize foreign material requirements for T&E.\n- Represent DOT&E at the Intelligence Mission Data Oversight Board responsible for development, production and sharing issues affecting the intelligence data supporting weapons systems acquisition.\n- Oversee legacy DOT&E investments and continue management and oversight of legacy and new Test Resource Management Center-funded threat system investments.\n\nThese activities will ensure DOT&E carries out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\n\nThe Center has received 47 requests for support in FY17, which exceeds our capacity to support.   The Center will assess the requests based on priority and schedule. The Center will test, analyze, and report on more than 30 systems, with emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CM\/CCM employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs. Each program supported will receive an independent assessment of our data\/findings and test support for CM\/CCM evaluations. The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&E enterprise, with a clear focus on Title 10 weapons systems, aircraft survivability and hostile fire initiatives. The Center will continue to conduct ongoing investigations towards determining and filling the gaps in EW and multimode system testing. In addition to these test activities, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM\/CCM-focused tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development. Our support will be distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.\n\nThe Center will complete the initial development of JSIS and the High-Power Portable Radar Threat Simulator (HPRTS), which will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and ASE urgent operational needs. The Center will complete the development of a new test van to support more remote threat live fire testing. The Center will continue working with the Threat Simulator Working Group (TSWG)-sponsored HSIG model. \n\nThe Center will provide expertise to many organizations and will continue to be actively involved in the following panels: JECM Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), JASP, Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&E Subcommittee, JCMT&E WG, and JCMT&E WG HFI subgroup lead.\n\n5th Generation Aerial Target (5GAT)\n\nIn FY17, the 5th Generation Aerial Target program will complete the government owned air vehicle and subsystems layout.  The program will begin tooling and parts fabrication using carbon composite manufacturing methods.  In addition, the program will begin the electronic attack equipment integration."

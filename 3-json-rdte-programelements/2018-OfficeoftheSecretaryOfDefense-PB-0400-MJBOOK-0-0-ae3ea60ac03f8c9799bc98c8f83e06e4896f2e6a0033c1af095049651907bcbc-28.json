            "val": "This Program Element (PE) addresses Defense Research and Engineering priorities to advance engineering state of the practice, and address complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including modeling and simulation (M&S), systems engineering (SE) research, and engineering capabilities for resilience, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems in support of the full range and scope of Department of Defense (DoD) missions and operations.\n\nM&S is a key enabler of DoD capabilities; underpins innovative solutions meeting real-world national security challenges; acts as a force multiplier; saves resources; and saves lives.  The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&S, enhances the DoD M&S Enterprise by (1) enabling cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&S.\n\nSERC is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department\u2019s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of 23 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD\u2019s systems engineering research problems.\n\nEngineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for achieving more affordable and mission-resilient warfighting systems designed within a shorter time frame by conducting research and development and new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, modeling capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.  These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that enables advanced knowledge management and multi-community collaboration, including data retention and lessons learned."

Its products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks that will integrate physics-based models and engineering tools across acquisition disciplines to vastly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, iteratively optimize designs and improve architectures to reduce or eliminate sensitivity to adversary tactics and capability improvements, and adapt those designs over time. The goal is to achieve a vitally-needed transformation in the contribution of Defense systems engineering to design resilience and effectiveness across the systems lifecycle. These engineering improvements are essential to address a geopolitical environment marked by rapidly changing threats, tactics, missions and technologies, and fiscal constraints. The pace of change renders current point-design approaches unsustainable in both cost and time.\n\nERS research and development focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.   These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration.  ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased\/easier utilization of High Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability."

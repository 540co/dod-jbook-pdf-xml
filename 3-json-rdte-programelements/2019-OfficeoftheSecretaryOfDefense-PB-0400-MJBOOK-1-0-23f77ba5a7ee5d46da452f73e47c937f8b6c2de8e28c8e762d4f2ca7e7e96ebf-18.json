This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities. \n\nDefense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government\/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. \n\nA number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY18 will continue defining and implementing DEF \u2018best practices\u2019 related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace."

As with the FY 2016 programs, FY 2017 feasibility studies will define the required actions for incorporating DEF into programs, begin DEF designs on select designated programs, and assess the potential costs of those actions.

OUSD (AT&L) will continue to engage with program offices through the Military Department DEF POCs, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other defense agencies to facilitate the feasibility studies.  OUSD (AT&L)\/IC will ensure the DEF feasibility studies are addressed in program Acquisition Strategies and Program Protection Plans (PPP).  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies were executed."

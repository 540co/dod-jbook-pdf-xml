CTTS also recognizes that many of the combating terrorism requirements already supports many of these high interest areas; to include, increasing lethal capability of U.S. forces at the squad and small unit level; countering Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (drones) overseas and domestically; tunnel detection and mapping in theater and along the Southwest U.S. border; novel body and vehicle armor; detecting and mitigating novel chemical threats against commercial transportation; telematics; covert communications; and the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  \nFrom a broader perspective, projects remain distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat\/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.\nWhile supporting the NDS, the CTTS program will also continue to identify capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and quickly delivers these capabilities to U.S. Defense and interagency users, as well as international partners through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation.  CTTS continues to expand its partnerships with other Defense and Interagency, as well as with our foreign partners\u2019 rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users.  CTTS is unique in its approach, annually obtaining joint requirements directly from military and law enforcement operators, intelligence analyst, and first responders.\nThe CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. This includes rapid technology capability development, testing products, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, operational test and evaluations, and coordinating the transition from development to operational use. For FY 2021, the time from requirements to contracts has been shortened in order to provide solutions even more rapidly to the users.  CTTS normally manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners; while also reviewing proposals and negotiating contracts for another 100 requirements prior to the next fiscal year.\nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, CTTS also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTS has earned throughout the Department of Defense and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products.  The funding and number of requirements from users that CTTS will be able to address in FY 2021 has been reduced by 25% in accordance with the Secretary\u2019s directed Defense Wide Review Task 266."

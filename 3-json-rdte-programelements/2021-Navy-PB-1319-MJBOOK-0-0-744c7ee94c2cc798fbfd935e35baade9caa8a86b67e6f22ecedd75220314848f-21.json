Delivery of breakthrough capability often requires new technologies in manufacturing and supply chains of national security. The Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program is intended to improve the productivity and responsiveness of the U.S. defense industrial base by funding the development, optimization, and transition of enabling manufacturing technologies to key naval suppliers.  In general, investments transition emerging Science and Technology (S&T) results to acquisition programs; improve industrial capabilities in production, maintenance, repair and industrial base responsiveness; and advance manufacturing technology to reduce cost, improve performance, and responsiveness. Currently, the ManTech Program is focused on affordability improvements for specific key acquisition platforms as defined in the Navy ManTech Investment Strategy.  Key platforms currently targeted include: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)\/OHIO Replacement Program (ORP); DDG 51 Class Destroyer; CVN 78 Class Carrier; Joint Strike Fighter (JSF); and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter.  Office of Naval Research (ONR) ManTech helps these Navy programs achieve their respective affordability goals by transitioning developed manufacturing technology which, when implemented, results in needed cost reduction or cost avoidance.\n\nToday's Sailors and Marines are enabled by naval Science and Technology (S&T). Since 1946, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) has fostered scientific research related to the maintenance of maritime superiority and national defense.  ONR manages the Department of the Navy's (DON) portfolio of naval Basic and Applied research, and Advanced Technology Development investments to ensure naval forces can effectively deter conflict, but when called upon, fight, win and come home safe. Current investments hedge against uncertainty, providing solutions to commanders today, and options for the future. The Naval S&T budget supports higher guidance defined by the National Defense Strategy, and responds to requirements identified by the Secretary of the Navy through research priorities set by the Chief of Naval Research, coordinated across the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE), and outlined in the Naval R&D Framework. \n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment. Efforts in this PE generally have Technology Readiness Levels TRL) of 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.), 5 (component and\/or breadboard validation in relevant environment.), or 6 (system\/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this Program Element (PE), the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Manufacturing Enterprise addresses the development, optimization, and transition of manufacturing enterprise technology to key naval platform suppliers. Emphasis is on affordability for the following shipbuilding platforms: VIRGINIA Class submarine (VCS)\/COLUMBIA Class submarine (CLB), DDG 51 Class destroyer, CVN 78 Class carrier, F-35 Lightening II aircraft (F-35), and CH-53K Heavy Lift Helicopter. Manufacturing enterprise technology areas include, but are not limited to design for easier production\/design for manufacturability; development of build\/assembly strategies; modeling and simulation technologies; model-based tools and approaches to optimize ease of production; intelligent manufacturing planning and factory execution; elimination of inefficiencies in design optimization, material usage, labor utilization, work flow, etc.; supply chain procedures and improvements (such as network centric manufacturing capabilities to facilitate resilient and adaptable supply chains); development of more efficient structural fabrication product lines; streamlining of outfitting operations; prediction and reduction of welding distortion; advanced automation and robotics for manufacturing; advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning for production environments; and inspection technologies such as digital radiography and ultrasonic technologies. Energetics efforts concentrate on developing energetics solutions to ensure the availability of safe, affordable, and quality energetics products largely in support of Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS)."

            "val": "This program element funds continuous efforts in the development of modernized tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems that will enable safety of aircraft operations.  ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil, military, domestic and international ATC mandates and combat identification requirements.  \n\nTactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS), the Army's system of record for Airspace Control (AC) and enroute Air Traffic Services (ATS) within the Army Mission Command Information System (MCIS), requires the development  testing and integration of these new web-based services for AC into common MCIS hardware, while meeting the Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  Includes development and testing of improvements to the air picture to include Blue Force Tracker correlation and radar fusion capability.  TAIS develops software and hardware for AC web services to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment and integrates advanced surveillance capabilities to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities.  \n\nAir Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) is an Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system that provides ATS at Army terminal airfields and landing sites at Division, Corps, and Echelons Above Corps to include services for Joint and Allied aircraft.  ATNAVICS will integrate TPX-59 capabilities to control aircraft both Outside of the Continental United States and Continental United States. ATNAVICS will network its radar picture and interrogator data to aviation and joint network nodes through TAIS.  .  As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies, flight information will be captured by the Advanced Surveillance program.  Advanced Surveillance allows ATC reception of aircraft self-reporting data to include the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast and integrates local radar feeds and self-reporting aircraft positional data into a correlated situational awareness air picture. \n\nMobile Tower System (MOTS) Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I) upgrades provides the Joint Force Commander or Combatant Commander a highly mobile, self-contained, integrated and reliable information system platform for visual and procedural aircraft deconfliction and aircrew force protection in unified action terminal airspace environments.  The Airfield Lighting System (ALS) is a component of the MOTS and can be operated by solar power or by generator power.  The ALS improvements include a Precision Approach Path Indicator and an ALS trailer charging system.  \n\nTactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) is a mobile ATC communications system that provides initial ATS at remote landing sites and drop zones. It enables secure ground-to-air and ground-to-ground communications between Army aircraft, other services, Allied aircraft and ground stations. TTCS provides aircraft separation and ground control capabilities, a meteorological measuring system for basic weather information, Blue Force Tracker which provides near real time situational awareness and precision location capability.  Future improvements include incorporating advance surveillance as risk mitigation by improving airspace situational awareness and providing an improved soldier interface that is common with other ATC systems.\n\nATC Tactical Networking supports the non-recurring engineering, test and evaluation tasks for  integration of radios, control stations and transmitter\/receivers and software that will provide all ATC tactical systems an airfield network node capability.  This will enable each ATC system to send voice and data between ATC platforms including connectivity to an external network for long range flight-following and data exchange further reducing aviation operational risk by providing ATC operators a common air picture.  ATC Networking is required to meet the Net Ready Key Performance Parameter for ATC tactical systems."

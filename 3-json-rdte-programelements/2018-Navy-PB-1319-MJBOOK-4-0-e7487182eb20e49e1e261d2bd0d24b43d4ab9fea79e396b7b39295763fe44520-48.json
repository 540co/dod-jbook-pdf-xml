            "val": "The Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Payloads integration program will alleviate Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability gaps caused by rapidly changing missions, threats and technologies. It will provide responsive capability to integrate and support rapid fielding of ISR payloads for all UAS within the Marine Corps. Sensor payloads will increase the effectiveness and versatility of the Marine Corps UAS currently planned to have Electro-Optic(EO) \/ Infrared (IR) collection, communications relay, and automatic identification capabilities. Upgrades include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)\/ Electronic Warfare Support (ES), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) \/ Moving Target Indicator (MTI), Wide Area and Hyperspectral Imagery collection.\n\nThese payloads provide the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) organic capabilities that facilitate the six functions of Marine Corps Aviation and the Marine Corps Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Enterprise across the range of military operations. \n\nThe payload development process will follow a Hybrid Acquisition Model of Incremental\/Spiral approach while leveraging work conducted by various government laboratories such as the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Agency (JIDA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Geospatial Agency (NGA). All payloads will follow similar acquisition paths but on independent time schedules. These acquisition paths will be defined by three (3) phases, each marked by a decision gate. Phase I establishes the preliminary integration design concept and conduct of technology demonstration with validation of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5\/6 as the decision gate for Phase II.  Phase II establishes full payload-to-Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) integration during which time all necessary program management, engineering, fabrication, test, and evaluations activities are conducted to achieve Test Article Fabrication, System Test and Evaluation, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) and Training Concept development, and Data Management and Documentation. Validation of funding, derived requirements, project risks, cost and schedule estimates, contracting strategy and achievement of TRL 7 or higher constitute the decision gate for Phase III. Phase III is program of record transition which supports a production decision based on the exit criteria from Phase II."

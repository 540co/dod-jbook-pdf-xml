These technologies will also be focused on reduction of time, risk, and costs associated with new therapeutic development.  For example, this program will develop in vitro tissue constructs (IVTC) that will emulate human response to therapeutic compounds, thereby significantly reducing the cost and time for evaluating safety and efficacy of therapeutics."

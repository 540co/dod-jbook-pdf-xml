EIS utilizes the services provided by Cloud One and Enterprise Resource Planning Common Services (ERP CS)\u2014together, previously known as the Common Computing Environment (CCE).  \n\nCloud One and ERP CS provide common platforms, common application support services, data center migration strategy, and security services for hosting AF mission applications. Cloud One provides AF target environments and cloud migration services for AF mission applications and ERP CS provides the AF target environments for AF ERP mission applications.  This acquisition is critical for multiple hosting environments leveraging DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) Core Data Centers (CDC), commercial cloud capabilities and DISA brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines. This effort also provides technical expertise, programmatic guidance, and policy navigation that supports AF approved application rationalization processes to multiple hosting environments and enterprise IT Lifecycle Capabilities Integration Environment (CIE) testing of services.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EIS capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis requirement supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

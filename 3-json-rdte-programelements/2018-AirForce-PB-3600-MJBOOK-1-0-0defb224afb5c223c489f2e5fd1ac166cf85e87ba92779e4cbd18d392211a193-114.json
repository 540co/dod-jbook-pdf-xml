Facility sustainment includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventative maintenance tasks, and emergency response and service calls for minor repairs. It also includes major repairs or replacement of facility components that are expected to occur periodically.  In addition to standard facility sustainment, such as roof replacement, refinishing of wall and floor surfaces, and repairing and replacing of heating and cooling systems, this work includes inspections and repairs of heavy plant machinery in large industrial facilities.  This work includes, but is not limited to, inspection and repair of high-power electrical switching gear, hydraulic, lubrication, forced-air and fluid cooling systems, high pressure vessel health monitoring, facility control and remote monitoring systems, liquid oxygen systems, steam systems, test instrumentation, and fire detection and suppression systems.  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and landscaping, waste disposal, and the provision of central utilities) are not included. These sustainment funds support the following Air Force organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, 704th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, the 412 Test Wing (TW) at Edwards AFB, CA, 704 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, AEDC's Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, and AEDC's National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

                            "val": "The REF FY 2020 RDT&E request is $2.793 million (Base) and $3.000 million (OCO) and is for system integration, testing, and evaluation to support project requirements\n\nThe REF is the Army's Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with the ability to acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), and Non-Standard Equipment (NSE) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for globally employed forces.  It inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select-prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.  The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions to inform materiel development for the future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.\n\nThe REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Memorandum, Under Secretary of the Army, 30 Jan 2014, subject:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF).\n\nThe REF bridges the gap between the Army's traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier Readiness, effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF 10-Liner process provides the ability to react quickly to an ever-changing enemy who changes in days and months, not years in a complex world.  The REF coordinates with the Combatant Command (COCOMs) and Army Service Component Command (ASCCs) in theater to fully understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  Although the REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, it focuses on Brigade level and below to equip solutions to identified capability gaps.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the Soldier's needs serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).  This establishes a formal acquisition reporting chain that leverages existing reporting venues to ensure appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) visibility, oversight, and direction.  \n\nThe REF capabilities cross all Warfighter Functions:\n1.\tMission Command\n2.\tMovement and Maneuver\n3.\tIntelligence \n4.\tFires\n5.\tSustainment\n6.\tProtection \n\nThe RDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, and innovative solutions.  RDT&E funds are necessary in the majority of all REF projects.  Most importantly, REF requires RDT&E funds to conduct safety certification (testing) for non-standard equipment before it is equipped to the Soldier.  This critical requirement exists to ensure that REF-provided equipment is safe for Soldiers to use and that any risks are identified and documented.  The REF also requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different COTS\/GOTS and NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.  RDT&E funds maybe used to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) systems or advanced technologies in conjunction with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs).  Frequently, these technologies only need small amounts of funding to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed U.S. Army Forces problems.  \n\nThe REF requires RDT&E funds to modify, test, and evaluate existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, however may be suitable to solve another problem.  REF will also fund deliberate projects in support of technology-solution-scouting to meet anticipated Army needs and to mitigate operational gaps.  These efforts measure and identify current technologies, and provide information to better inform Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and other communities of interest, with the intent of enlightening future Army requirements.  Example efforts that may require RDTE include the following projects:  Tactical Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and communications systems; tactical and small Combat Out Post\/Forward Operating Base (COP\/FOB) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Force Protection systems; Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS); Electronic Warfare (EW) systems; Non-Tactical Vehicles (NTV); Persistent Duration UAS, and Subterranean (SubT) Operations."

The REF focus is on rapidly placing capabilities into Soldiers' hands.  This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) rapidly adapting COTS\/GOTS\/NDI equipment to meet operational needs, and 2) developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia.  All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment are provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved acquisition program or terminated through an approved Army process.  Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation and future capability development.  REF capabilities routinely serve as a bridge to specific ONS, JUONS, and JEONS gaps to meet urgent operational requirements."

This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint Expeditionary Mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This equipment enhances the field Soldier's well-being and provides the Soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support."

This PE supports the maturation and demonstration of technologies associated with aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, rapid ammunition\/munitions deployability and resupply, combat rations and combat feeding equipment, combat clothing and personal equipment (including protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear), and expeditionary base camps with an emphasis on emerging operating environments and missions that require expeditionary maneuver. The Projects focus on the challenge of integrating clothing and individual equipment on the Soldier to effectively bridge the gap between humans, technology, and equipment design. The Projects in this PE adhere to Tri-Service Agreements on clothing, textiles, and food with coordination provided through the Cross-Service Warfighter Equipment Board, the Soldier as a System Integrated Concepts Development Team, and the Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board.\n\nWork in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602787A (Medical Technology), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology), PE 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0603015A (Next Generation Training and Simulation Systems), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603008A (Electronic Warfare Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.\n\nWork in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602786A (Warfighter Technology) and supports Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) operational concepts by demonstrating precision aerial delivery and airdrop from non-traditional platforms.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

The architecture will provide a unifying performance construct that considers human dimension and equipment capability resulting in a desired tactical outcome by applying systems engineering processes, analytical tools, and models to assess the complex Soldier as a System and conduct system level trade-offs. This capability is used to assess new and emerging Soldier clothing and equipment components as well as configurations against established baselines using Human-in-the-Loop principles. This effort also matures and integrates associated foundational efforts including human performance assessment measures and evaluation devices required at various testing locations. This effort develops standardized methodologies required for demonstrations to provide operationally relevant assessments.

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers, which are rapidly deployable\/re-locatable, require no Military Construction, and need limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and assesses the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under Program Element (PE) 0602786A \/ Project VT4. Demonstrated EBC equipment is transitioned to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).\n\nWork in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

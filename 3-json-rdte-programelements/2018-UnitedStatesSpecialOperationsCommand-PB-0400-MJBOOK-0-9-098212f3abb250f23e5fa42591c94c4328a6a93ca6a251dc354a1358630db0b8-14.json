These submersibles, equipment, and diving systems are used by SOF in the conduct of infiltration\/extraction, personnel\/material recovery, hydrographic\/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:\n\n\u2022   Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS):  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development of one Engineering Developmental Model (EDM) to replace the SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) system.  The EDM is being developed due to obsolescence of the SDV system.  This project will utilize mature technologies, which include electric propulsion along with upgraded navigation, communication, and sensor suites.  It also provides for integration efforts with the current Dry Deck Shelter (DDS), development of engineering changes for SWCS production craft configuration, and integration of other diving technologies to meet SOF requirements.  \n\n\u2022  Dry Combat Submersible (DCS): This sub-project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development efforts for a surface-launched, dry, diver lock-in\/lock-out vessel capable of inserting and extracting SOF and\/or payloads into denied areas.  USSOCOM awarded an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in FY 2016 to produce one production representative vessel, with options to produce two additional vessels.   USSOCOM is testing one submersible prototype to validate test, commercial classification, and SOCOM safety certification processes and will continue to use the prototype to evaluate capability enhancing technologies and reduce risk in the DCS program.\n\n\u2022   DDS Modernization:  This sub-project provides for the pre-planned product improvements, testing, and integration of specialized underwater systems to meet the unique requirements of SOF, and compatibility with the submarine fleet.  The current DDS is a certified diving system which attaches to modified host submarines that provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms.  Funding supports product improvements to the current DDS, as well as associated diver equipment for in-service submarine support systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, and follow on development efforts for future SOF payloads.\n\n\u2022   SOF Combat Diving:  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, development, and transition of SOF peculiar diving equipment providing the SOF combat diver the ability to engage the enemy and conduct operations.  SOF Combat Diving will provide capabilities to USSOCOM components and will support the SDV, SWCS, and DCS in conduct of infiltration\/extraction, material recovery, underwater ship attack, beach clearance, and other missions.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, commercial and developmental life support, maneuverability, employment of weapons, diver navigational accuracy and situational awareness, thermal protection, and underwater communications."

                            "val": "This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development of medium and heavy surface combatant craft, combatant craft mission equipment, and pre-planned product improvement (P3I) and technology insertion engineering changes to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF).  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:\n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Medium Mk 1 (CCM):  This sub-project is a semi-enclosed, low-observable, multi-mission combatant craft for platoon-size maritime mobility in maritime denied environments.  It is multi-mission capable, including Maritime Interdiction, Insert \/ Extract, and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) Operations.  CCM is Naval Special Warfare\u2019s (NSW) craft-of-choice for long-range, high-payload SOF mobility operations in denied environments up to high threat.  CCM has NSW\u2019s best Iron Triangle: 40 knot (kt) speed; 4 crew + 19 passengers (pax) \/ 10,000 pound (lb) payload; and 600 nautical miles (nm) range.  CCM Mk 1 payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 60 feet long, CCM is C-17 \/ C5 transportable and can launch\/recover by well deck or shore based trailer.  \n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH):  This sub-project represents a family of solutions that provides platoon-size maritime surface mobility.  The current CCH is the Sea, Air, Land Insertion, Observation, and Neutralization (SEALION) craft.  SEALION is a fully-enclosed, climate-controlled, low-observable, semi-submersible craft that operates in denied environments up to high-threat. SEALION is NSW\u2019s most versatile and survivable combatant craft and the craft-of-choice for sensitive maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and those missions requiring a prolonged presence in denied environments.  Its clandestine mobility capability is only exceeded by an undersea craft.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 7 crew + 12 pax \/ 3,300 lb payload; and 400 nm range.  SEALION payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 77+ feet long, SEALION is C-17\/C-5 transportable and can launch\/recover by well deck or shore based mobile travel lift or crane.  \n\n\u2022   Next Generation Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (NG CCFLIR):  The CCFLIR capability provides SOF with a multi-sensor, electro-optic system that enhances SOF effectiveness by improving their ability to detect, recognize, identify, range, track, and highlight objects of interest in a maritime environment.  The NG CCFLIR will use technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as operational range, image fusion, net-centric data sharing, information assurance, and seamless craft and combat systems integration.\n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Mission Equipment (CCME):  This sub-project (previously Next Generation Surface Systems) provides a rapid response capability to support SOF combatant craft systems, subsystems, and their emerging requirements.  CCME provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as, but not limited to, conformal antennas, identification friend-or-foe capabilities, enhanced communications, weapon integration, software refresh, and navigation subsystems in support of future missions.  Solutions to these emerging requirements may be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), leveraged from other Government agencies , or new solutions. \n\n\u2022   Combatant Craft Assault (CCA):  This sub-project is a National-to-Theater transition.  The CCA is the theater version of the High Speed Assault Craft.  The CCA is a low-observable combatant craft for squad-size maritime mobility operations in maritime denied environments.  CCA is NSW\u2019s best craft for VBSS in maritime denied environments up to and including medium threat.  It is the craft-of-choice for maritime interdiction and boarding operations because of the open deck space, maneuverability, and interoperability with an Afloat Forward Staging Base.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 3 crew + 12 pax \/ 5,000 lb payload; and 300 nm range.  At 41 feet long, CCA is air transportable by C-130 \/ C-17 \/ C-5 and can launch\/recover by crane, davit, well deck, or shore based trailer.\n\n\u2022  Threat Awareness System (TAS):  This sub-project provides SOF with an Electronic Intelligence capability for enhanced force protection of SOF in Maritime denied environments by allowing them to identify and avoid enemy detection capabilities.  TAS will utilize technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as miniaturization and marinization to enable seamless craft integration."

Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistic support.  \n\n\u2022  CCH:  SEALION I & II were transitioned from U.S. Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I & II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity.  Based on market research completed in December 2015; currently pursuing a Sole Source award for SEALION III in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I & II.\n\n\u2022  NG CCFLIR:  Completed a full and open competition in September 2015.  An Engineering Manufacturing Development contract was awarded to FLIR Systems Incorporated, which included production and sustainment options.  The NG CCFLIR will be installed on the CCM, CCH, and CCA.\n\n\u2022  CCME acquisition strategy emphasizes on spearheading Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology for successful transition into SOF Combatant Crafts. CCME accomplishes this by using the full spectrum of contracting services, using existing contracts where appropriate, and leveraging from other Government agencies including the Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&L Science & Technology. CCME focuses on developing the technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility, to then transition to the craft. The integration and procurement piece is managed by the individual Combatant Craft Program.\n\n\u2022  CCA will use various contracting and better buying power practices to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the craft\u2019s current performance envelope.\n\n\u2022  TAS will conduct market research to determine feasibility and appropriateness of conducting a full and open competition. TAS will pursue existing Government-Off-The-Shelf technology in order to reduce acquisition timeline."

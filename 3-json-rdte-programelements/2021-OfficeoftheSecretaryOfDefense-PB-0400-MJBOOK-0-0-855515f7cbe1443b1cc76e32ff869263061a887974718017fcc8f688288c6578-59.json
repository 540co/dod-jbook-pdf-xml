            "val": "As the Department of Defense strategic, operational, and tactical plans and objectives transform the war fighter with new capabilities and doctrine, the budgeting and accountability of funds used to pursue the Department objectives will become more complicated and detailed for senior leaders to make decisions with supporting rationale for the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.\n\nThis initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C).\n  \nNEXT GENERATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:\n\nThe Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) is responsible for advising the Secretary of Defense on all Defense budgetary and fiscal matters, for Defense budget development and execution, and for overseeing financial management across the Department. The OUSD(C) has a broad set of responsibilities in supporting the Planning, Programing, Budget and Execution (PPBE) process. The Office of the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), provides independent analytic advice to the Secretary of Defense on all aspects of the Defense program, including alternative weapon systems and force structures, the development and evaluation of program and defense program alternatives, and the cost-effectiveness of defense systems.  There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements. The Comptroller\u2019s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.\n\nOUSD(C) and CAPE use multiple systems to formulate, justify, distribute, and execute DoD budgets. The information managed by the budget formulation and programming systems is redundant, and reconciliation of information is difficult and inefficient. These systems require extensive manpower investments to give executives the information they need to make key financial decisions in a timely manner.\n\nThe OUSD(C) and CAPE require a more efficient, effective Defense budget environment that optimizes the budget cycle to ensure users are processing and reporting efficiently and DoD Senior Leadership has the information to make informed, critical decisions.\n\nThe OUSD(C) requires capabilities that shall provide for the effective formulation, and justification of the Defense budget. The requirement is for:\n\u2022 Automated exchange and reconciliation of budget data\n\u2022 Improved efficiency through the utilization of a unified budgetary model\n\u2022 Instantaneous ability to generate data for management reviews and decisions\n\u2022 Capability to accommodate emerging business practices\n\nMoving forward, the new \u201cto be\u201d system shall be designed as a single system with a unified data source for OUSD(C) and CAPE. The new system shall provide a single, integrated system that employs the latest technologies to fulfill the Department\u2019s financial management responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. The new system shall provide twenty-first century information technology that shall allow users to view information from multiple fully integrated modules simultaneously, e.g., current year budget submission, decision documents from previous years, and budget execution information.\n\nDEFENSE REPOSITORY FOR COMMON ENTERPRISE DATA:\n\nDefense Repository for Common Enterprise data (Advana) support financial audit, cost management, performance management, and readiness.\n\nThe DoD Advana requires:\n\u2022 All supporting Department data that rolls up to the DoD financial statement (detailed accounting data reconciled to the financial statement)\n\u2022 Proof of the completeness of all transactional data reported within the UoT (detailed accounting data reconciled to business events)\n\u2022 Ability to extract subset populations\n\u2022 Ability to secure and protect the data within the UoT\n\nThe failure to meet these requirements will result in the Department unable to successfully conduct and pass an audit.\n\nTo achieve these requirements, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is creating a tool called the Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (Advana). This tool has the potential to significantly improve DoD\u2019s capability and capacity to handle large volumes of standard and non-standard business and readiness data. Both an application and analytical platform, the Advana leverages an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications to deliver a complete Advana.\n\nThe first phase of Advana implementation is a proof of concept with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) systems to develop a baseline application and configuration. When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The proof of concept was successful and the program moved to an operations phase in FY18.\n\nDRCED is a joint effort between Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO), Office of the Chief Management Officer (ODCMO), Office of the Chief Information\nOfficer (OCIO), USSOCOM, and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)."

The Office of the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), provides independent analytic advice to the Secretary of Defense on all aspects of the Defense program, including alternative weapon systems and force structures, the development and evaluation of programs and defense program alternatives, and the cost-effectiveness of defense systems. \n\nOUSD(C) and CAPE use multiple systems to formulate, justify, distribute, and execute DoD budgets. The information managed by the budget formulation and programming systems is redundant, and reconciliation of information is difficult and inefficient. These systems require extensive manpower investments to give executives the information they need to make key financial decisions in a timely manner.\n\nThe OUSD(C) and CAPE require a more efficient, effective Defense budget environment that optimizes the budget cycle to ensure users are processing and reporting efficiently and DoD Senior Leadership has the information to make informed, critical decisions. \n\nThe OUSD(C) requires capabilities that shall provide for the effective formulation, and justification of the Defense budget. The requirement is for:\n\u2022 Automated exchange and reconciliation of budget data\n\u2022 Improved efficiency through the utilization of a unified budgetary model\n\u2022 Instantaneous ability to generate data for management reviews and decisions\n\u2022 Capability to accommodate emerging business practices\n\nMoving forward, the new \u201cto be\u201d system shall be designed as a single system with a unified data source for OUSD(C) and CAPE. The new system shall provide a single, integrated system that employs the latest technologies to fulfill the Department\u2019s financial management responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. The new system shall provide twenty-first century information technology that shall allow users to view information from multiple fully integrated modules simultaneously, e.g., current year budget submission, decision documents from previous years, and budget execution information."

Without an automated capability to provide a transactional universe for sampling and\nevidentiary proof the department will not be in compliance with public law.\n\nThe requested funds will be used to buy \u201cBig Data\u201d software and hardware infrastructure and required contractor services to implement the technology to meet the UoT\nrequirement.  These funds also include subject matter expertise costs for DCFO and funds to be placed on a contract for hardware, software, and labor. This will not result in hiring additional government personnel.\n\nThe Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (Advana) will have the capability to:\n\u2022 Ingest data from multiple accounting and financial feeder systems\n\u2022 Normalize data from multiple sources providing a common data architecture\n\u2022 Reconcile transactional details to summary financial data\n\u2022 Provide auditor\u2019s the ability to sample TI-97 detailed transactions\n\u2022 Business Analytics\/Reporting\n\u2022 DATA Act which is a statutory requirement to be completed by May 2017\n\u2022 Provide NIPR and SIPR capability for non-sensitive and sensitive data\n\nThis effort will expand in scope to support other enterprise analytics efforts like cost management, performance management, and readiness. The scope is to bring in\ndata from an estimated 50 systems and demonstrate existence and completeness of business and accounting transaction data, which are capabilities required for audit\nreadiness and other analytical use cases."

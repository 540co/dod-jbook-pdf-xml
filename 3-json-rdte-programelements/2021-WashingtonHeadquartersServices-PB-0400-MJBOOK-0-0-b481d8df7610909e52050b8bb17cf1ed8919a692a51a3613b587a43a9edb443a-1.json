DDS requirements are driven by challenging technical problems identified by the Secretary of Defense where technology is failing the Department's mission and could impede the lethality and effectiveness of the war fighter.  These technical problems vary in scope and complexity, but at a minimum, when resolved, have a positive impact on the war fighter's mission and capabilities.  DDS involvement may be in the development of new code, product management, advising on code development processes and releases, and hacking or re-writing existing policies or processes that are antiquated or otherwise unnecessary.  DDS engages on highly troubled projects to quickly implement fixes that ultimately reduce schedule slip, increase security, lower costs, improve user experiences, and accelerate performance.    \n\nThe most pressing project in which DDS is engaged involves the vetting and security clearance process for personnel.  DDS has partnered with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency to build a prototype to improve the personnel vetting and security clearance process.  With the transfer of the background investigation mission from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to the DoD, DDS is exploring ways to deliver more accurate vetting results while eliminating the existing backlog of cases. The DDS-led System for Automated Background Evaluation and Review (SABER) prototype effort will focus on delivery of an automated investigation result, beginning with the user applying for a clearance, processing the data through government and commercial databases, recording an adjudication decision, and enrolling in continuous evaluation."

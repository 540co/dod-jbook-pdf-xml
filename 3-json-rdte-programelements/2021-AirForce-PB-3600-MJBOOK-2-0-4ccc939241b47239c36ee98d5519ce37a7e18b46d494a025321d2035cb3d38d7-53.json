Based on the Department and Air Force direction, there is a concerted effort in these periods of fiscal restraint to reinvigorate, institutionalize, and systematize wargaming across the Department.  This effort requires continued funding to maintain the level of effort to most effectively pursue an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources.  The Air Force continues to refine the wargame process and design to better integrate and synergize those efforts in support of the new Air Force Strategy, Planning, and Programming (SP3) process.  Specifically, in addition to maintaining a robust Title 10 Wargame series, Global Engagement, servicing Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) objectives. The HAF Wargaming Enterprise is executing on-call Wargaming in support of the AF\/A5, the Agile series, along with quick-turning wargame support to the USAF Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team (ECCT) requirements, the Enterprise series,  Plan Blue, and to service AF\/A5S strategy and concept development objectives; all to better address the requirements of the SP3 process and cycles.  Additionally, HAF Wargaming provides and coordinates Air Force representation at other Service and Joint wargames as they execute across the department.  These efforts are providing decision support to senior Air Force leaders involving investment strategies and develop concepts to best employ U.S. forces in future conflicts.\n\nThe Wargame Information Environment (WIE) is a continually evolving system that provides an array of services to game players which enables the accomplishment of game objectives.  The backbone of the WIE is GameNet, a deployable, standalone, Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, three-dimensional visualizations & mapping, and services.  Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off-the-shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the wargame.  The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently collaborate, make decisions, present those decisions, and execute moves within the wargame; documenting each step in the process.  This information capture enables discovery during the wargame and permits postgame analysis.  These findings inform portfolio rebalancing exercises, concept and strategy development, and very senior leader decision making.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

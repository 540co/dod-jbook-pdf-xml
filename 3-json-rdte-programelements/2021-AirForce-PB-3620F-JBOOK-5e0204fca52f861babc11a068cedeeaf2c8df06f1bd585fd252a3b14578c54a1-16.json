SATCOM provides survivable communications for Presidential support and nuclear command and control, and affords national and military leaders a means to maintain strategic situational awareness and convey their intent to the Joint Force Commander (JFC).  In order for the United States to maintain its asymmetric advantage of global space-based communications, the SATCOM enterprise must be prepared to \"fight SATCOM\" as a single enterprise through a Contested, Degraded and Operationally-limited (CDO) environment, prevent or withstand loss, and continue to deliver effects to warfighters.\n        \n        The Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) strategy is to evolve current and future SATCOM systems to meet the needs of an integrated \"Fighting SATCOM\" Enterprise, sustain the existing AEHF system capability, develop a more affordable and resilient SATCOM enterprise capable of meeting near term and emerging requirements, demonstrate technologies and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) that lead to a future Protected Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM (PATS) capability that provides tactical level Military SATCOM (MILSATCOM) users protected, anti-jam satellite communications while operating in a contested environment, and develop an integrated (Commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM and MILSATCOM) \"Fighting SATCOM\u201d Enterprise. PATS will provide tactical users significantly higher data rates than AEHF and a security architecture that enables forward deployed users to have protected satellite communications in scenarios where AEHF terminals cannot be deployed. \n        \n        Under this construct the SMI will: 1) Continue the Capabilities Insertion Program (CIP) to enhance the current AEHF constellation and Protected Communications performance, and improve system operational resiliency, 2) Invest in technologies and demonstrations (e.g. Protected Tactical Service Field Demonstration (PTSFD)) that enable the future Protected Tactical Enterprise Service (PTES) and SATCOM programs by continued development of the Protected Tactical Testbed, and demonstrating resilient and affordable wideband protected technologies and CONOPS, 3) Demonstrate and develop a roadmap to evolve the current stove piped MILSATCOM Command and Control (C2) management system into an integrated \"Fighting SATCOM\" Enterprise, 4) Develop and demonstrate flexible terminal interface technologies with Services and SATCOM Terminal providers, and 5) Develop and demonstrate an improved integration of ground gateways and data networking with the space segment with the goal of providing seamless end to end SATCOM service for the warfighters in a CDO environment. \n \nThe FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $7.224 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n      \n        Space acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats. Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\n        This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AEHF weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392SF and 1206398SF.\n                \n        This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."

Findings in both AoA reports identified the need for an enterprise approach to managing SATCOM in an aggregated architecture for both cost savings and the necessary responsiveness to counter evolving threats.  Market research has identified high Technology Readiness Level products; and prototyping demonstrated mature interfaces and architectures to enable rapid capabilities that are \"Fighting SATCOM\" Enterprise-aligned."

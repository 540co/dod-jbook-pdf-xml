In addition, this effort validates laser lethality performance and conducts analyses against a variety of targets and investigates the impact of low-cost laser countermeasures.  This project includes laboratory efforts for HEL applied research as well as concepts analysis for United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC\/ARSTRAT) Technical Center competencies in directed energy, missile defense, and space technical areas. Solid State Laser (SSL) efforts continue to leverage other funds provided by the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO), the Air Force, and the Navy to develop multiple technical approaches that reduce program risk and maintain competition. \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

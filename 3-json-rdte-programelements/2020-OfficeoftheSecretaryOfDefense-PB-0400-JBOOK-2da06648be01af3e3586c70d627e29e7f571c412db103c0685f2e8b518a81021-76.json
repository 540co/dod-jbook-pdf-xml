            "val": "This Program Element provides funding to support efforts to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  The targeting of U.S. capabilities by our strategic competitors create the potential to degrade core U.S. military technological advantages through unwanted technology transfer.  The technology transfer, primarily unclassified technology, threatens DoD's ability to maintain the technology advantage required to support the lethality and survivability of the Joint Force.  DoD is executing a campaign plan to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  First DoD is promoting strategic technology investment to provide DoD access to new and innovative technology.  These investments are required to create breakthroughs in key areas of basic research, foster transition and decrease time to market of applied research to economically viable companies, and harvest U.S. innovation or with likeminded allies.  Secondly, DoD must ensure its strategic technology investments are protected against unwanted technology transfer by developing and maintaining the tools and techniques that enable the U.S. engage in technology transfer at the time, place, and parties of our choosing.  Thirdly, DoD must combat adversaries' attempts to thwart U.S. technology security mechanisms to control technology transfer.  The Department will support these three efforts by developing the appropriate suite of analytic tools, a data acquisition strategy, and utilize program protection activities to address the threat over the long term.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific RDA practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor networks; improve mitigation of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, mature processes to identify Critical Program Information integration of defense exportability features and improve program protection planning."

Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department, and is critical to preserving intellectual property, enhancing the competitive capabilities of our national industrial base, and maintaining DoD\u2019s technology advantage. This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production, system maintenance \/sustainment and component manufacturing.  To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities.  DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security (e.g., implement cybersecurity standards on contractor information system networks, report cyber-intrusion incidents, manage deemed exports, and other mechanisms that result in the loss of this information) to protect this information from all loss mechanisms.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses, rethink how we safeguard our capabilities, and deter our strategic competitors. \n\nThis project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information, and an analysis of losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action to include deterring our strategic competitors and identifying opportunities to promote our innovation base."

Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drives the need for diligent program protection planning and execution.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of classified and unclassified controlled technical information, critical program information, critical components and critical mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition and S&T practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor information networks; improve mitigation and management of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify and protect Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of DoD Instruction 8582.01 Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems for Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks."

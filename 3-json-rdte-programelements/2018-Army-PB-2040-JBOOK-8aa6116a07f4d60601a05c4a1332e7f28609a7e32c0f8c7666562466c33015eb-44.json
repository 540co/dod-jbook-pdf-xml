On 14 Jul 2015, the trigger Configuration Steering Board (CSB) concurred with the Course of Action (COA) to validate the revised requirement for the Echelons Above Division (EAD) Gray Eagle and grant authorities through a new Acquisition Decision memorandum (ADM) to pursue the extended range capable Gray Eagle configuration.  ER is an enhanced derivative of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS and closes the capability gap by delivering extended surveillance coverage which supports Army RSTA missions in excess of 34 hours.  ER\u2019s extended range provides the capacity for multi-intelligence payloads, precision strike capability, and reconnaissance in support of Special Operations Forces (SOF), Mission command from Aerial Intelligence Brigade (AIB) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).

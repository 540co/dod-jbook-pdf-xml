Tasked by the Secretary of Defense, the NEC will oversee and monitor operations and security of the enterprise and develop tools to assist in monitoring the readiness of the NC3 architecture and capture the operational risks as adversaries develop the ability to disrupt our capabilities from multiple threat vectors.  This effort will fund systems engineering and assessment activities previously accomplished by DISA in support of the NC3 Enterprise. \n\nThe NEC will capture and integrate process and system data to assess operational risk, characterize multi-domain threats, and explore operational trade space associated with next generation NC3 architectures.  The NEC will work with the services to explore new technologies and develop innovative solutions in a virtual environment, and capture metrics that identify system problems and readiness issues before they impact operations. The NEC will also develop digital engineering capabilities to help support governance responsibilities of NC3. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NC3 enterprise capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

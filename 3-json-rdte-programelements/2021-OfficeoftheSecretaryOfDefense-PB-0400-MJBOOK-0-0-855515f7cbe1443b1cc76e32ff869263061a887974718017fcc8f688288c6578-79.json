The DOD SBIR\/STTR Program funds over one billion dollars annually in mission oriented research and development (R&D) projects via small technology companies. The purpose of the program is to stimulate technological innovation, increase private sector commercialization of Federal R&D, increase small business participation in Federally funded R&D, foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation, and cultivate cooperative research & technology transfer between small business and research institutions. The SBIR\/STTR Program is codified in 15 USC 638. The SBIR\/STTR Programs competitively fund scientific and technical innovation to specifically address the mission needs of participating DOD components. \n\nDOD components participating in the SBIR and STTR Program include the: Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), Joint Science & Technology Office for Chemical & Biological Defense (CBD), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)."

Phase III SBIR\/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR\/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR\/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and\/or non-SBIR\/ STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in military and\/or private sector markets. This PE funds the administrative support to the SBIR\/STTR programs including policy development, monitoring program execution for participating DOD agencies, outreach to small businesses, training for DOD small business and contracting professionals, and an annual conference to bring together the stakeholders for networking and program updates."

                            "val": "This project provides AEGIS Cruiser & Destroyer ACS upgrades and integrates new equipment and systems to pace the threat and capture advances in technology. ACS capabilities have continually evolved starting with AEGIS Baseline (BL) 2 on Guided Missile Cruisers (CG) 52-58, BL 3 on CG 59-64, and BL 4 on CG 65-73, BL 5 on Guided Missile Destroyer (DDG) 51-78, BL 6 on DDG 79-90, BL 7 on DDG 91-112, BL 9 starting with DDG 113 and BL 10 on First Flight III DDG. \n\nThe AEGIS Modernization Baselines will provide new technology to replace aging military equipment, extend service life, and maintain combat viability of AEGIS combatants into the future. These baselines reduce combat system maintenance life cycle costs and streamline the development of capabilities.  AEGIS BL 9, consisting of an upgraded computing infrastructure and computer program enhancements, will modernize DDG 51-53, 57, 61, 65 and 69.  AEGIS BL 9 will also be introduced on the new construction destroyers, DDG 113-124 and DDG 127.  CG 59, 60, and 62 computer programs will also be upgraded, bringing all BL 9 warfighting improvements (with the exception of BMD).  BL 9 will provide an updated computer program to BL 8 CGs (CG 52-58), improving warfighter effectiveness by introducing Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA), improved SM-6 integration, capabilities to address Fleet Urgent Operational Needs (UONs), and reducing the number of AEGIS Baselines within the Fleet. \n\nAEGIS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 16 and the required Technical Insertions (TI) 12\/12H\/16 Computing and Display Plant will provide warfighter upgrades to AEGIS Cruisers and Destroyers to include improved Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities (DDG only), SEWIP BLK II, MH-60R Integration, IFF Mode 5\/S, SPQ-9B in the Fire Control Loop, Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC), Condition Based Maintenance, Combat System Boundary Defense, NIFC-CA 2019, and NIFC-CA Collateral #3. ACB16 will support 3 hardware configurations: PHASE 0 AEGIS BL 9.C2.0 TI12 will support 15 DDGs (51\/52\/57\/61\/65\/69\/80\/113-120) and 2 AEGIS ASHORE (AA) facilities (Poland\/Romania); PHASE 1 AEGIS BL 9.C2.1 \/ 9.A2.1 TI12H will support 2 DDGs (79\/83) and 7 CGs (63-65\/66\/68\/69\/71); and PHASE 2 AEGIS BL 9.C2.2 TI16 will support 12 DDGs (81\/84-88\/92\/94\/121-124, 127) and 3 CGs (70\/72\/73).\n\nAEGIS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 20 and Technical Insertion (TI) 16 will provide critical warfighter upgrades to AEGIS FLT III Destroyers. ACB 20 combat system development and integration efforts will support the Air Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) acquisition milestone requirements and build upon ACB 16 to form the foundation for the AEGIS Flight III DDG Combat System. Provide Computer program updates that can be backfit to AEGIS TI 16 hardware configurations.\n\nAEGIS Far Term Interoperability Improvement Plan will address the remaining interoperability issues within fielded AEGIS Combat System configurations to integrate F\/A-18 Digital Air Control (Phase 1) in support of F\/A-18 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter initial deployment, integration of the Shipboard Gridlock System\/Automatic Correlation (SGS\/AC). These updates will be implemented in a phased approach to align with current and future AEGIS development efforts.\n\nAEGIS Task Force Cyber Awakening will assess and provide corrective actions to improve AEGIS Combat System Computer Program and Hardware configurations against emerging threats within the Cyber arena. These improvements will be implemented within AEGIS Combat Systems currently under development and include updates to Boundary Defense Components (BDC).\n\nAEGIS BL 5.4 combines AEGIS BL 5.3.9 and BMD 4.1 into single AEGIS Computer Program enabling a near simultaneous shift from AAW to BMD to AEGIS Flight I\/II DDGs to ensure viability against emerging threats until end of service life (ESL). These improvements will include Computer Program updates to integrate the improved radar performance provided by the hardware upgrades to the SPY-1D radar.\n\nAEGIS IFF MODE 4\/5 Integration program will address Mode 4 issues; implement Mode 5 IFF within the Fire Control Loop for All AEGIS Baselines by 2020 to support Urgent fleet demand to support emerging warfighter requirements.\n\nCombat Systems Test Bed (CSTB) will address the shortfalls in AEGIS Modeling & Simulation highlighted by DOT&E in BL 7, 8 and 9.1.  Combat Systems Test Bed will provide automated analysis to efficiently process large amounts of M&S data.   This increased data will allow a deeper understanding of Surface Combatant performance allowing the Program Office to quickly identify gaps and validate solutions to field capabilities faster."

These enhancements will address current and future training requirements by implementing new functionality to enable the individual warfighter through distributed battle group events to engage in more complex training requirements to support fleet required training certification events. Capability Development and integration are related to Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Underwater, Surface, and other warfare areas. Capability enhancements and upgrades include development of re-useable common components that can be leveraged by SSDS MK2 combat systems, and\/or integration of re-usable common components developed by the TSTC Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT) Program and Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) MK2 TSTC Training Improvement programs to meet AEGIS combat system training requirements. TSTC provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict, realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas (e.g. NIFC-CA and BMD missions to support IAMD). TSTC provides ships' Commanding Officers and Battle Group\/Battle Force Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Organization, the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F Fleet Synthetic Trainers (FSTs).   TSTC continues to integrate and update, as new tactical capabilities are being introduced, to enable crew operator proficiency training for basic and sustainment level training events, through distributed strike group certification fleet synthetic training (FST) events and including COMPTUEX FST at Sea integration into Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environment.  Continued Development is required to integrate new capabilities and interfaces to provide training for AEGIS and SSDS combat system capability upgrades, and to address the Fleet's Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) Fleet Training Wholeness initiative.  Additionally, modernization is needed to support the DoD Training Transformation Plan, the Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Response Plan and Commander United States Fleet Forces Command Fleet Readiness Training Plan.\n\nThe Advanced Training Domain (ATD) is being developed to combine BFTT and the AEGIS Combat Training System (ACTS) into a common system that integrates with AEGIS BL 9.2.2AF, and SSDS BL 11.xAF.  ATD is being hosted along with the AEGIS and SSDS combat system on TI-16 common processing and display hardware.  ATD is being designed to be the core of the Total Ship Training Capability, and is projected to be more reliable, simpler to use, and architected to be extensible to meet interoperability and capability enhancement challenges in the future.\n\nThe BFTT is being updated to maintain integration and capability enhancements developed for the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), and the Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC), and SSDS Fire Control Loop Improvement Program.\n\nTSTC provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict, realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas (e.g. NIFC-CA and BMD missions to support IAMD). TSTC provides ships' Commanding Officers and Battle Group\/Battle Force Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Organization, the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F FST\/LVC events.\n\nDevelop and integrate MH-60R simulator to enable embedded shipboard training in support of basic and sustainment training, as well as establishes the pathway to support pier-side Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) events.\n\nDevelop and Integrate Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Enhanced Training (CET) to support basic and sustainment level training, as well as provide ability to distribute and establish CEC data link during pier-side fleet synthetic training exercises.  CET will also provide enable proficiency training of NIFC-CA capability.\n\nDevelop and integrate CEC Interim Training (CIT) capability to support pier-side fleet synthetic training events.  This is an interim capability support the distributed portion of the CET capability, until CET is fully deployed.  This supports training of strike groups of new tactical capabilities that were integrated into the AEGIS BL9 ships, and provides the necessary functionality to allow ships to train as a strike group.\n\nDevelop and integrate upgrades to Battle-Force Electronic Warfare Trainer (BEWT) to support soft kill training with NULKA.\n\nDevelop Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) simulator to enable training of Modes 1, 2, 3A, 4, C, 5 and S on both AEGIS and SSDS ships.  Capability will support AEGIS and SSDS IFF MODE 4\/5 Integration program will address training Mode 4 Inoculation, and allow training of Modes 5 and S IFF.\n\nDevelop and integrate commensurate training improvements to SSDS ACB 20 for Enhanced Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and Electronic Warfare (EW) tactical improvements.\n\nIntegrate Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) networking and cyber security upgrades maintain authorization to participate in distributed shipboard training events.\n\nTSTC integrated on AEGIS provides the capability to complete system and operational level testing of the combat system."

Efforts demonstrate seamlessly integrated communications and information security technologies across all network tiers, ranging from unattended networks and sensors, through maneuver elements using airborne and space assets. Project EL4 matures and integrates antennas, wireless networking devices, protocols, and software; network operations tools and techniques; and combines these with current fielded networks and systems in a series of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) network modernization demonstrations to measure their technology readiness levels and assess them against currently fielded network architectures in an operationally relevant environment. Project EL5 matures information security devices, techniques, services, software and algorithms to protect tactical wired and wireless networks against modern network attacks; generates and distributes tactical cyber situational awareness; and focuses on configuration, operation, monitoring, defense and network reconstitution in bandwidth constrained tactical environments while reducing the operator workload required to conduct these functions.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology) and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).\n\nFY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC)."

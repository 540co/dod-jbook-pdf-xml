            "val": "The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will enable leaders, Soldiers, and units to train where they will fight, along with their partners with whom they will fight, in complex operational environments to include dense urban, woodland, jungle, dessert, and sub-terrain, before they get there.  The STE will operate within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi-Domain Operations.  STE is currently a pre-acquisition effort leveraging Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs) on the path to Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in FY 2021.  This collective training capability will revolutionize Army training by providing the repetitions and sets necessary to achieve improved proficiency prior to live training and combat; thereby improving Soldier lethality and survivability.  The STE will be available where training occurs (home station, combat training centers, armories, institutions, ship-board, deployed).\n\nSTE is comprised of three main Lines of Effort: 1) STE-Information System; 2) Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCT), both air and ground; and 3) Soldier \/ Squad Virtual Trainer (SSVT). STE-IS (delivers the Common Synthetic Environment, like an operating system), consisting of Global Terrain\/One World Terrain (OWT), Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The RVCT Air and Ground (RVCT A\/G) will collectively train units, using proponent developed Combined Arms Training Strategies (CATS), on a simulated, fully interactive, real-time battlefield.  S\/SVT is broken into Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) and Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT). SiVT, which is the immersive training capability delivered as part of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) provides initial squad training capability for S\/SVT in Increment 1.  SVT will support Army wide formations such as artillery, Military Police, and units for Weapons Skills Development, Joint Fires Training and Use of Force.  Future lines of effort under market research include the integration of Live training and Next Generation Constructive.  The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, and will include  the future Live and Constructive capabilities. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.\n\nFY 2021 base funding of $129.547 million will finalize the technical  development and demonstration of prototype designs to deliver IOC at 5 installations (Ft. Hood, JBLM, Ft. Leonard wood, Ft. Benning, and Ft. Drum) for STE-IS, RVCT, and SiVT (IVAS). Funds will also support conducting a Limited User Test (LUT) to verify and validate the capabilities of TSS, TMT, OWT and RVCT as an integrated prototype solution in the CSE.  This effort will reduce technical risk, validate design, validate cost estimates and refine requirements for future STE, S\/SVT and Live capabilities."

                            "val": "The STE will be a single, yet comprehensive interconnected training system that provides a Common Synthetic Environment (CSE), in which air and ground units from crew\/section through Army Service Component Command (ASCC) conduct realistic multi-echelon \/ multi-domain combined arms maneuver, air ground integration, and mission command training. All of these components are interconnected and based off of a standard, modular and open system architecture model. The focus of the FD6 project is on the STE-IS and RVCT components of the holistic training strategy. The STE-IS provides a common software environment consisting of the Training Management Tool (TMT), Training Simulation Software (TSS), and One World Terrain (OWT) solution. The Training Management Tool (TMT) is the capability that enables units to quickly plan collective training events, prepare training events; execute and monitor events, and assess event results and readiness.\n\nThe Training Simulation Software (TSS), the core STE simulation engine, provides a realistic STE-IS that enables collective training from Soldier\/Squad through ASCC. The STE-IS is a dynamic, digital representation of the Operational Environment (OE) and the military capabilities in the scenario. The TSS provides entity, aggregate, and common services, as well as adjudicates STE-IS interactions at the entity level (e.g., Computer-Generated Forces (CGF), and synthetic equipment).\n\nThe One World Terrain (OWT) is a 3-Dimensional global terrain capability and associated information services that supports the virtual replication of the physical Earth and complexities of the Operational Environment in support of training in the STE. The STE and RVCT requirements, which are codified in abbreviated Capabilities Development Documents (CDD-A) with full versions currently in staffing, directly support the Army Collective Training Environment - Initial Capabilities Document (ACTE-ICD) as the Army's cornerstone for replicating the Operational Environment (OE) during training events enabling the Army to train as it fights. Separate, but interoperable, RVCT systems are required for both air and ground collective training. The Air RVCT will represent the U.S. Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserves fleet of rotary wing aircraft, and specified U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft. The Ground RVCT will represent ground\/amphibious track and wheeled vehicles from the U.S. Army, Army National Guard, Special Operations Units and the USMC.\n\nFY 2020 Update: STE User Assessment conducted in Apr-May 2019 further refined the requirement and demonstrated that the technology was quickly maturing and provided better costing data for STE.  In June 2019, the contracting command awarded five subsequent STE OTAs for the STE-IS, RVCT, and S\/SVT (Weapons Optimization) to seven vendors allowing better refinement of the technical requirements needed to achieve IOC in 4Q 2021.  The focus of FY 2020 is on development and technical user assessments leading to a successful Limited User Test and Initial Operating Capability for the STE-IS and RVCT components in FY 2021.  \n\nFY 2021 base funding of $122.553 million will finalize the technical development and demonstration of prototype designs to deliver IOC at 5 installations (Ft. Hood, Joint Base Lewis McCord, Ft. Leonard Wood, Ft. Benning, and Ft. Drum) for STE-IS and RVCT. In addition, funds support conducting a Limited User Test (LUT) to verify and validate the capabilities of STE-IS and RVCT as an integrated prototype solution with military utility. This effort will reduce technical risk, validate design, validate cost estimates and refine requirements for future STE, S\/SVT and Live capabilities."

To ensure speed and agility to deliver and modernize STE, a modular open systems architecture (MOSA) will be developed enabling the Army to exploit rapid advancements in cutting-edge commercial visualization and immersion technologies. STE will employ an IT Box requirements model to enable agile development of the STE-IS with parallel incremental development of the RVCT A\/G and S\/SVT. This model facilitates leveraging commercial and Government technology development that are necessary for future Live and Constructive centered increments. Other acquisition elements such as testing, contracting, and technology transition will consider any and all means available to innovate and incorporate complementary support to add momentum in this approach.\n\nSTE Increment 1 IOC is programmed for 4Q 2021. IOC is defined as the first fielding and acceptance of the STE-IS capability at installations identified IAW the Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP). IOC fielded STE systems will include the following attributes: verification, validation and accreditation process complete; STE-IS capabilities in support of RVCT A\/G and Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) IOC in FY 2021 and ultimately the Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT) IOC in FY 2023; meeting Information Assurance and Risk Management Framework requirements. New Equipment Training (NET) will include the capability to support the RVCT, and the ability to provide initial sustainment via interim contractor support (ICS). Soldiers will interface with the STE-IS through the Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainer (RVCT) and SiVT via the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS).\n\nFuture phases currently under market research will provide Soldier\/Squad Virtual Trainer (S\/SVT) capabilities and integrate Live training components as well as Next Generation Constructive (NGC).\n\nFive (5) OTAs were awarded in FY 2019 in support of STE prototype initiatives: STE-IS (TSS\/TMT, OWT), RVCT, Live (market research only), and SVT Weapons Optimization (market research only). Confidence events and evaluations were built into the OTAs to determine the readiness and availability of technology in support of 4Q 2021 IOC. Prime(s) and Sub-vendors will execute the STE agreement(s) through an Agile development process with established success criteria and their DevOps processes. Vendors will continually include the Government and all stakeholders (Internal and external) in the Agile development process. This process will ensure all parties have transparency and early input into the modular design effort in order to support success of the product(s) being developed for the STE."

The S\/SVT is the next generation trainer that enables Soldiers\/Marines to conduct squad, weapons, and joint fires training, as well as rehearse lethal and non-lethal use-of-force interactions prior to live events to measure the unit's Mission Essential Task List proficiency, which then provide a unit's Objective 'T' readiness.\n\nS\/SVT is comprised of Squad Immersive Trainer (SiVT); also commonly referred to as both the IVAS and the Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT) capabilities. The first increment of the SSVT, which is the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) capability, integrates into the Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.0 as part of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). Increments 2 and 3 of S\/SVT combines individual Soldier and squad training into a single capability and includes STE Squad Capability (SSC), Weapon Skill Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF), which integrate the NEXTGEN Marksmanship and the NEXTGEN Call For Fire Artillery Virtual Training capability into the STE baseline.\nThe second phase; the SVT system design combines and integrates several individual Soldier and squad training capabilities, Weapon Skills Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF).\n\nS\/SVT is dependent and interconnected through the STE-IS software baseline. The STE-IS core cross-cutting capabilities deliver software, application(s) and services that optimize cloud-enabled capability simulation processing to Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainer (RVCT), Soldier Squad Virtual Trainer (S\/SVT), and the future Next Generation Constructive (NGC) capability to include Force-on-Force (FoF) and Force-on-Target (FoT) Live training instrumentation.\n\nFY 2021 funding of $6.994 million reinitiates the market research and prototype solutions for the SVT solution assessing industry and academia's technical readiness and availability around Weapons Skills Development, Joint Fires and Use of Force."

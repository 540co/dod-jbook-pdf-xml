Active implementation included 14 Joint Concepts into Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) processes during FY 2016 resulting in 3 studies, 5 Capabilities-Based Assessments (CBA), 14 DOTMLPF-P Change Requests (DCR), 1 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), 3 Capability Development Documents (CDD), 1 Capability Production Document (CPD), and development of 3 Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) courses. The final update for the Joint Operational Access Concept Implementation Plan was signed May 2016 signaling that appropriate DOTMLPF-P processes are developing capabilities critical to addressing Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) challenges.  18 legacy concepts were approved by the Director of the Joint Staff for archival.  The CJCSI 3010 was approved Aug 2016 with improved terminology and process descriptions to guide joint concept development and implementation.  Initiated the pilot year of the DepSecDef directed Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund (WLIF) program, resulting in 13 OSD-funded projects designed to spur and support warfighting field experiments, demonstrations, and operational user input to develop innovative capabilities, and new operational and organizational constructs to address emerging warfighter challenges."

This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management, and are measured by the following:\n\n(1)\tMeet IOC that enables rapid generation of GFM decision-making information for Policy-makers and warfighting Combatant Commands based on authoritative Service force capability, readiness, availability and current employment data.\n\n(2)\tReducing the manual process of assembling Capability, Readiness, Availability, Employment (CRAE) data, is the first step to providing enhanced force management decision-making. Mining this data is currently a labor-intensive, time-consuming process and significantly impedes rapid response capabilities. Automating this data aggregation requires EFS Data services and Web Service Interfaces supporting a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog (JFCC) as described in the EFS Capability Package (CP) and is critical to operationalizing the force structure data and achieve GFM DI Next Steps Allocation.\n\n(3)\tServices, CCMDs, Joint Staff and OSD will be able to efficiently manage (collect and analyze) force generation data supporting GFM in far less time than the current process, and with an authoritative common view of the sourcing-to-employment tracking of forces. This is accomplished by the automated linking of the Organization Unique Identifier (OUID) attributes from the GFM DI Org Servers (OS) to the Unit Identification Code (UIC) resident in JOPES.\n\n(4)\tThe JFCC will enable the rapid generation of information when making time-sensitive decisions and allow a Joint Planner to inculcate the association of standard and consistent force structure instance data and consistently applied data \"types\" with force structure data referenced over time in the GFM sourcing solution generation and deployment planning, execution, and distribution processes.\n\n(5)\tAbility to meet the VCJCS guidance to meet the GFM DI Full Operating Capability (FOC) by FY 2020 for GFM Allocation."

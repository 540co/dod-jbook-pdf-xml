This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA\u2019s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development budget projects.\n\nThis project aligns with DTRA\u2019s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction and consequence management communities. The portfolio addresses this guidance through S&T investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Program managers drive interdisciplinary portfolios primarily drawing from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and information and network sciences. The portfolios themselves are broadly focused on fundamental, exploratory research to support the development of: standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; nuclear detection in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; WMD agent defeat technologies; and biologically-based and -inspired materials for DoD applications.\n\nThis project maintains a robust, forward-looking portfolio targeting mission-focused research demonstrating scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for breakthrough discoveries."

The Basic Research portfolio was restructured to establish a University Partnership (UP) model with a new prioritization process. This process will focus novel UP research on high-priority CWMD gaps, to include energetics and reactives, nuclear data, weapons effects, materials science, machine learning, radiation biology, advanced analytics, and other critical areas.  This model reduces administrative burdens and increases technical collaboration with partners focused on current and emerging areas of interest thereby allowing for reduced investment in FY 2020."

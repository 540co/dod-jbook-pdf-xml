Projects under the CTEIP PE support the National Defense Strategy and align with the USD R&E priorities.  CTEIP funds projects in Hypersonics, Directed Energy, Cyber Security\/Electronic Warfare, Missile Defense, Nuclear Effects, Space Autonomy and Command\/Control and Communications.  Other Investments align with objectives in the Strategic Plan for DoD T&E Resources for high priority test needs and common range Infrastructure.  \n\nThe Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other Government agencies T&E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities. CTEIP evaluates and selects for execution those proposed projects that best provide the greatest return on investment; make efficient use of limited test resources; leverage Service investment; and promote joint solutions to fill test capability gaps.  CTEIP provides enterprise solutions that benefit the Department as a whole.  The CTEIP PE supports two basic tasks: investments to improve and develop the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Projects (REP).\n\nThe JIM funds critically needed T&E investments in the major areas across the USD R&E priorities and planned investments which continue to drive innovations on our Major Ranges and Test Facility Bases to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of testing.  Examples of Critical investments include infrastructure developments needed for testing hypersonic weapon systems, electronic warfare threat emulators long range airborne telemetry, mobile optical tracking, nuclear survivability and unmanned and autonomous systems. CTEIP continues to serve as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and linkages between test and training ranges.  \n\nThe REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high-priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), or system-of-systems testing. Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.\nThis Budget Activity 6 PE includes special studies, analyses, project improvements, quick reaction efforts and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  Additionally, this activity supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD testing requirements for component weapon systems.\n\nDetailed below is the description of the FY2021 CTEIP budget.  FY2021 includes increased investments in high-priority hypersonic ground and open air range test capability developments, for critically needed upgrades to DoD Threat Models and Simulations, investments in High Energy Laser testing, revitalization and improvements of the Nuclear Effects testing capability and efforts to test autonomous vehicles both virtually and live."

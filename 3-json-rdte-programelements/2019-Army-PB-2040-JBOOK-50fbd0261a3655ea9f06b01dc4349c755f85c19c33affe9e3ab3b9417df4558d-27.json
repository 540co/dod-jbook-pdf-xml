These capability drops will be based on requirements contained and further developed as part of the PCTE Information System Capability Development Document (IS CDD).  Efforts in FY19 focus on expanding access, developing, integrating, and evaluation prototype capability drops. In addition, limited capabilities provided in prior years will continue to be improved and developed.

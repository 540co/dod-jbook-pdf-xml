Scheduled 6.2 upgrade for FY18 have been changed to FY19.  6.6 upgrade removed from schedule to be planned for FY23. TTR 2018.1 and 2018.2 upgrade removed from system Development and Delivery schedule.  Next Gen Phase 3 changed from FY18 to FY19, and Next Gen Phase 7 removed from current schedule, to be planned for System development and Delivery for FY23.\n\n3093: Cost growth in FY18 from previous submission due to revised government Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE).  The revised LCCE supports the contract awarded in March 2017.  Areas of cost growth include increased hardware development costs based on adjustments to the ground station necessary to account for a shipboard variant; additional Software Lines of Code (SLOC) due to implementation of an open systems architecture and limitations on reuse of legacy proprietary software code, and an increase due to systems engineering\/ program management (SEPM) labor costs required to mature and integrate system components.   Cost growth funded via prioritization within aviation training and range programs."

The BFTT component develops new capabilities and integrates training capabilities developed by the AEGIS and SSDS TSTC into a consolidated integrated training system for use on AEGIS and SSDS ships. TSTC enhancements developed address current and future training requirements to align with the Combat System new and improved capabilities by implementing new functionality and by integrating capabilities being developed by both the AEGIS and SSDS Training Improvement Programs into a consolidated training system. TSTC developments and upgrades include the evolution to an open distributed architecture with maximum commonality across ship classes, integrating existing training systems, or leveraging capabilities developed by other programs.  \n\nTSTC provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict, realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas (e.g. NIFC-CA and BMD missions to support IAMD). TSTC provides ships' Commanding Officers and Battle Group\/Battle Force Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Organization, the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F FST\/LVC events.\n\nDevelop and integrate commensurate training improvements to SSDS ACB 20 for Enhanced Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and Electronic Warfare (EW) tactical improvements.\n\nTSTC integrated on SSDS provides the capability to complete system and operational level testing of the combat system."

Products from this effort are directly tied to the Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP), MH-60R\/S master plan, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) master plan, the Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) program, component technologies, including the Multiplex Data Bus Controller Translator Transmitter, F\/A-18C-F Requirements Procurement Plan (RPP), open architecture implementation, multiple technology refresh efforts and the Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft\/P-8 programs.  These efforts will support training optimization of future naval aviation training\/preview\/mission rehearsal systems (fixed, deployed, and unmanned).  Tasks include: specification development to provide for common, modular, High Level Architecture compliant, high fidelity Distributed Mission Training and mission rehearsal capabilites ashore and afloat.  Technologies to be developed and integrated include: intelligent semi-automated forces (SAF) technologies, automated performance measurement technology, advanced net-ready weapons simulation, Air to Air\/Air to Ground, visual\/sensor enhancement, sensor\/weather server, common post mission assessment technologies, tablet mission preview technology, advanced visual-sensor technology, high resolution helmet mounted, and\/or flat panel displays, 20-20 visual acuity image generation, NAVAIR Portable Source Initiative improvements, common correlated data set technologies, common link, common software\/database reuse technologies, advanced environmental effects modeling, fused radar\/infra-red\/electro-optic and acoustic sensor simulations, aerodynamic modeling, physics-based infra-red simulations, spatial disorientation research, comms degradation modeling, and final Test and Evaluation (T&E) within the Aviation Training Technology Integration Facility (ATTIF), Naval Air Warfare Center-Aircraft Division.  This Manned-Flight Simulator (MFS) ATTIF capability provides a window to fleet aviators for critical comment, evaluation and fine tuning of new, interoperable, and innovative technologies such as LVC before final transition to the fleet.  Naval Aviation Distributed Training Center, debrief\/After Action Review (AAR), and intelligent training tools for the virtual environment are focused on human performance and trend analysis enhancements for fleet readiness and distributed mission training at all levels.  \n\nMetrics:  These technology transitions seek to lower Total Ownership Costs of the training systems and life cycle costs, including: increasing software re-use, reduced instructor manning profiles, software-based fidelity enhancements and increased fleet readiness by enhancing overall system fidelity to the projected operating environments.  NASMP readiness improvements are conservatively forecasted at 12-35% Training and Readiness improvement via synthetic environment upgrades and associated technology upgrades to stand-alone and networked simulators.  Individual technology transition investments have routinely exceeded 300+% financial Return On Investment.  Technology Readiness Levels, Training and Readiness, fleet readiness, and financial metrics are used."

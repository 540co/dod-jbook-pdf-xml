            "val": "This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop material, biological and energy technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.\n\nThe major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, fabrication and processing techniques, models, devices and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and\/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems. Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of technology areas including manufacturing, electronics, sensors, optics, and complex and autonomous systems.\n\nThe Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new DoD capabilities. This influence extends throughout the development of new materials, devices, and processes and relies on the integration of biological breakthroughs with those in engineering and the physical sciences. Contained in this project are thrusts that apply biology's unique fabrication and manufacturing capabilities to produce novel chemicals and materials at scale, as well as research to develop new high-throughput methods and devices to analyze biological changes at the cellular and molecular level. Additional work leverages advances in synthetic biology to engineer novel biological systems and develop new approaches to biosecurity. This project also includes major efforts aimed at integrating biological, computational, and digital sensing methodologies to explore neuroscience technology and maintain human combat performance."

It will also develop approaches that yield new materials, materials capabilities and parts that cannot be made through conventional processing approaches, as well as address efficient, low-volume manufacturing.  As a result of recent advances in manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing and manufacture on demand, and the push towards programmable hardware in embedded systems, the development cycle from design to production of both hardware and software is severely bottlenecked at the design phase.  Integration of advanced materials with superior properties into manufacturing approaches is also complex and slow, hampering new materials integration and evolution of design.  Research within this thrust will create methods to translate natural inputs into software code and mechanical design, as well as reduce manufacturing complexity through new material feedstock formats with reconfigurable processing technologies.  This thrust is an aggregation of programs previously contained in Multifunctional Materials and Structures."

The path from idea generation to a discovery is a lengthy, complex process involving many unpredictable steps, cycles and stages across fundamental and applied research and development.  Research in this thrust is an outgrowth from Multifunctional Materials and Structures that is focused on developing and implementing strategies to address many of the challenges and bottlenecks inherent along this path and to speed the rate at which an idea can be advanced into a concrete capability.  Specific approaches include advanced multiplayer gaming technologies to catalyze development of new technology concepts, development of tools for data collection and visualization to accelerate fundamental and applied research, and strategies to understand how seemingly benign commercially available technologies may be converted or combined into threats to military operations, equipment or personnel.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project MS-01.  This thrust is an aggregation of programs previously contained in Multifunction Materials and Structures."

The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces created the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics and imaging systems.  The program also sought to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic and other inorganic materials to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program was to develop new design tools that enabled optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools and manufacturing processes enabled previously unattainable 3-D optical designs to be manufactured."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.\n\nResearch thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments).  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01."

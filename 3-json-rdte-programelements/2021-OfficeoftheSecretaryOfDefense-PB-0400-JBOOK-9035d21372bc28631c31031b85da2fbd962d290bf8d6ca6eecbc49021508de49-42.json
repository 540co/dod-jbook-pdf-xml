CWP comprehensively addresses all three National Defense Strategy lines of effort: to develop a more lethal joint force; strengthen alliances and attract new partners; and implement business practices for greater performance and affordability. Coalition warfare and multinational operations are fundamental features of the U.S. National Security Strategy. Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. Coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.\n\nCWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent\u2019s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  For every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects, the program has leveraged $3 in foreign partner resources \u2013 from 76 foreign partners \u2013 and $2 in other U.S. Government resources, providing an overall 5:1 return on investment.  CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners."

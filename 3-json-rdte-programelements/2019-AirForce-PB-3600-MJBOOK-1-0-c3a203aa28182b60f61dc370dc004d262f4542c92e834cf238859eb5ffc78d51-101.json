            "val": "The AF requires a comprehensive set of test facilities to implement the Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) Test Process in order to test EW systems, including Directed Energy (DE).  To manage program risk effectively throughout the weapons system acquisition process, and conduct T&E effectively and efficiently, a broad multi-spectrum, integrated set of T&E capabilities for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) through open-air ranges (OAR) is required. The EW Test Process Support task provides for investment management, coordinated technical oversight, and application of EW T&E facilities, including studies, analyses, and related documentation.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) at Holloman AFB, NM, provides timely, accurate, and secure RCS and antenna measurements for tri-service and joint program offices, DoD laboratories, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry.  The NRTF tests fielded and developmental systems and technologies to meet Low Observable (a.k.a. stealth) and EW customer requirements.  The Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), 412 EWG\/OL-HN and the Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) provide the ability to realistically evaluate hardware components and simulated weapon systems against manned hardware threat representations throughout the acquisition process.  GWEF and 412 EWG\/OL-HN provide simulations of advanced Infrared (IR) semi-active Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs), Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), IR and Laser countermeasure functions; integration of actual threat hardware and ground clutter into advanced threat IR missile simulations.  DIADS provides algorithm based enemy command and control (C2) capabilities plus early warning radar detection, limited ground control intercept features and also allows man-in-the-loop interaction for the enemy C2 positions.  The Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) will replace 90's technology with state-of-the-art stimulators to upgrade the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, CA and provides Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) capabilities at the BAF.  Improvement and modernization efforts within this PE are identified for the EW mission area.  EW provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support the AF EW Test Process, including DE.  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installation or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

To manage program risk effectively throughout the weapons system acquisition process, and conduct T&E effectively and efficiently, a broad multi-spectrum, integrated set of T&E capabilities for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) through open-air ranges (OAR) is required. The EW Test Process Support task provides for investment management, coordinated technical oversight, and application of EW T&E facilities, including studies, analyses, and related documentation.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) at Holloman AFB, NM, provides timely, accurate, and secure RCS and antenna measurements for tri-service and joint program offices, DoD laboratories, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry.  The NRTF tests fielded and developmental systems and technologies to meet Low Observable (a.k.a. stealth) and EW customer requirements.  The Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), 412 EWG\/OL-HN and the Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) provide the ability to realistically evaluate hardware components and simulated weapon systems against manned hardware threat representations throughout the acquisition process.  GWEF and 412 EWG\/OL-HN provide simulations of advanced Infrared (IR) semi-active Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs), Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), IR and Laser countermeasure functions; integration of actual threat hardware and ground clutter into advanced threat IR missile simulations.  DIADS provides algorithm based enemy command and control (C2) capabilities plus early warning radar detection, limited ground control intercept features and also allows man-in-the-loop interaction for the enemy C2 positions.  The Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) will replace 90's technology with state-of-the-art stimulators to upgrade the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, CA and provides Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) capabilities at the BAF.  Improvement and modernization efforts within this PE are identified for the EW mission area.  EW provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support the AF EW Test Process, including DE.  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems."

Annually, the MAJCOM commanders establish a list of their top 20 requirements. The MAJCOMs' requirements lists are integrated and prioritized into a classified Air Force requirement list.  Each MAJCOM then approves the FMA Top 20 List and final validation comes from the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.  System analyses are based on and driven by acquisitions.  The USAF provides assessments and data for threat systems to all DoD components."

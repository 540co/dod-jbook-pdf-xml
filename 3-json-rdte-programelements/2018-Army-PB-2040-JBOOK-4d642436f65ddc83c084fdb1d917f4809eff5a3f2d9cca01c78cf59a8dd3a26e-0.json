This project funds collaborative applied research and integration of government, academic, and industry scientific research to advance innovative capabilities.  \n\nThis PE sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Soldier\/Squad portfolio. \n\nWork in this PE builds on the materials research transitioned from PE 0601102A and 0601104A. This work complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (ISN) industrial partners through Fiscal Year (FY) 2017."

The AMPV will replace five mission roles currently performed by the M113 FoV by transferring the current M113 Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) to a new Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD) platform. In total, the AMPV FoV will account for approximately 30% of the ABCT's tracked fleet and consists of the following five variants:\n1. Mission Command (MCmd) Vehicle: This platform enables effective mission command planning and execution for both the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and Tactical Command (TAC) Vehicle versions of the MCmd. It will host current Battle Command Systems, future replacements, and upgrades of hardware and software.\n2. Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.\n3. Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litters or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.\n4. General Purpose (GP) Vehicle: This platform will operate throughout the battle space by conducting re-supply, maintenance, casualty evacuation, and other tasks within the formation.\n5. Mortar Carrier (MC) Vehicle: This platform will provide immediate responsive fire support to conduct fast-paced offensive operations.\n\nThe AMPV program was initiated with a Capability Development Document (CDD) that was approved on 21 June 2013 and subsequently revised on 24 October 2016.\nThe CDD reflects a set of stable, technologically achievable requirements.

In addition, the contractor will continue work related to Logistics\/Product Support. All 29 prototypes will undergo testing in FY2018, with tests often occurring simultaneously at multiple locations. The contractor will support these tests by providing Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to assist in repairing and maintaining the prototypes and by providing Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to troubleshoot any issues that might arise during testing. As required, the contractor will update the AMPV designs to address any shortcomings that are uncovered during testing or to incorporate any updates to government performance requirements. A Corrective Action Period (CAP) is planned for late 1QFY2018 through late 2QFY2018. During the CAP, the contractor will incorporate any design changes that are deemed necessary. An Interim Design Review (IDR) will be conducted at the conclusion of the CAP. The IDR will demonstrate that design changes made after the CDR are baselined and the system design is ready for manufacturing. A minimum of seventeen (17) artifacts will be generated by the contractor in support of IDR. Additional system level testing will take place following the CAP. At least 9,950 miles (not including contractor shakedown testing) will accrue during formal government testing prior to the CAP and at least an additional 9,500 miles will accrue following the CAP. Following completion of the post-CAP system level tests, a Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) will occur 4QFY2018. During the FCA, the contractor will demonstrate that the as-tested performance of the vehicles complies with design and interface requirements. Immediately following the FCA, the contractor will support the Limited User Test (LUT) in 4QFY2018. Eighteen (18) of the prototypes will be used during the LUT and the contractor will support the test by having FSRs and Test Engineers (TEs) on site and SMEs on call. Besides ensuring that the prototypes are adequately supported before and during testing, the contractor will provide all facilities, parts, tools, and other support items necessary to conduct a Logistics Demonstration (Log Demo) 2-4QFY2018. The contractor will validate the logistics support package prior to the Log Demo and will ensure that the nine (9) primary objectives of the Log Demo are achieved. The first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract option covers 52 vehicles, 10 of which (2 of each variant type) will support Full-Up System Level (FUSL) live fire testing. The recurring manufacturing cost associated with these 10 live fire assets will be Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funded, while the remaining 42 vehicles will be Procurement funded. Further, the live fire testing is scheduled to begin 2QFY2020 and the lead times associated with select hardware, such as electronic components, is expected to be such that some items must be procured as early as 3QFY2018. In accordance with the Full Funding Policy, the entire procurement cost of the live fire test assets is being budgeted in the fiscal year in which select items are initially procured. Accordingly, the FY2018 cost in this element includes the full recurring manufacturing cost necessary to procure 10 FUSL live fire test assets."

The contractor provided support of EMD testing activities at government test locations; including Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) testing at the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), system live fire testing of prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), and Limited User Testing (LUT) at a location to be determined. All testing activities were completed by the end of 1QFY2019. As required, the contractor analyzed the results of the testing program and incorporated any necessary design changes into selected prototypes. In addition to test support, the contractor completed a System Verification Review \/ Production Readiness Review (SVR\/PRR) 1QFY2019. The SVR\/PRR is a formal examination of the program to ensure that the AMPV design is ready for production and that the contractor has accomplished adequate production planning. As part of the AMPV design assessment, the contractor may also evaluate the capabilities of the AMPV design to satisfy other emerging Army requirements. Based on all engineering design work completed under the EMD contract, the contractor will also complete and deliver a final Technical Data Package (TDP). A final significant area of effort for the prime contractor during the EMD contract is continued work related to Logistics Support. This includes completion of the Logistics Demonstration, completion of the entire Technical Manual validation, and the start of Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) verification. In addition, and in support of Milestone C, the contractor will support an update to the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), completion of the Product Support Business Case Analysis, completion of the Depots Source of Repair (DSOR) Analysis, completion of the Core Depot Assessment (CDA), and completion of the Item Unique Identification (IUID) Plan. Following completion of Milestone C (completed 1QFY2019), the program will exercise the existing option for the first year of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP-1). Under the LRIP-1 contract option, the prime contractor will provide support to planned Production Qualification Testing (PQT) and, therefore, this element also includes costs related to PQT support. FY2019 prime contractor efforts will include support to PQT planning and the identification\/procurement of System Support Packages (SSPs) that will be required for PQT. Also in support of PQT, the Government will procure selected mission equipment for the PQT test articles."

As part of PQT, and in support of Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) assessments, six vehicles will run a total of 14,000 miles. The miles will be equally split between the Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) and the Yuma Test Center (YTC). An additional 19 vehicles will undergo performance testing as part of PQT. This testing will be performed at ATC, YTC, White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC), and Dugway Proving Grounds (DPG). PQT is conducted with production-representative vehicles from LRIP. The objectives include verification that the production-representative systems meet performance requirements, generation of data to support the system evaluation in support of the Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision, and determination of system readiness to enter Initial Operational Testing (IOT). Government costs include all costs incurred at the test sites and costs associated with Government personnel that will be collecting\/analyzing test data, as well as personnel associated with providing oversight of the test activities. The LFT&E will yield information to complement earlier vulnerability tests and modeling and analysis efforts, and will be used to fill data voids from prior testing. It will validate ballistic and blast performance at the system level to completely evaluate vehicle, crew, and occupant survivability. Ten vehicles will undergo testing at ATC and there are three elements to the testing: Controlled Damage Experimentation (CDE), Fire Survivability Testing, and Full-up System Level (FUSL) testing. CDE will be conducted on selected subsystems integrated into the AMPV to determine the consequences of various types of damage. This information will be used to confirm the impact of subsystem damage on platform functionality. Fire Survivability Testing will generate the data required to evaluate the effectiveness of the Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) to protect crews and internal and stowed equipment from fires expected to be initiated by ballistic impacts. FUSL testing will demonstrate the ballistic resiliency and crew survivability of fully functional, production-representative, combat-loaded AMPV variants and investigate the synergistic effects of various damage mechanisms and failure modes. Government costs include all costs incurred at ATC and costs associated with Government personnel that will be collecting\/analyzing test data, as well as personnel associated with providing oversight of the test activities. Finally, as required, vehicle design updates incorporated as corrective actions may be proven out on modified prototype vehicles at select Government test locations. All Government costs incurred as a result of these tests are included in this element."

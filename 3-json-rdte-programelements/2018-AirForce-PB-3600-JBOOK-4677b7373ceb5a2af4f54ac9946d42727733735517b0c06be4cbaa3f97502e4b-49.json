Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during airland operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.\n\nC-17 RDT&E funding efforts support, but are not limited to:  Aircraft performance improvements and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications\/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering\/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; block development\/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering\/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.\n\nIn FY18 the major efforts are:  Replacement Heads-Up Display (RHUD), Fire Filter Mitigation, and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS).\n\nFilter Fire Mitigation which is a redesign of the shutoff valve.\n\nBLOS includes, but is not limited to:  Narrowband tactical satellite communications Mobile User Objective System (MUOS); both Aero-I\/Aero-H multi-channel voice and data upgrades delivered via an intermediate-gain antenna; next-generation Military GPS receiver (M-Code); and upgrades for Ku\/Ka band satellite communications.\n\nCommand and Control Capsules to replace non-airworthy Silver Bullet Capsules includes development\/design. Effort will allow US Government senior leaders and staff to work, communicate, and rest in airworthy capsules during long range missions into threat areas, with the protection of the C-17A Globemaster III's defensive systems capability.\n\nReal Time In Cockpit (RTIC) enhancements integrate a situational awareness (SA) capability that allows aircrew to communicate with ground crew during airlift, airdrop, and other joint operations.\n\nFixed Installation Satellite Antenna (FISA) enables high bandwidth satellite communications, allowing for greater, in flight situational awareness. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

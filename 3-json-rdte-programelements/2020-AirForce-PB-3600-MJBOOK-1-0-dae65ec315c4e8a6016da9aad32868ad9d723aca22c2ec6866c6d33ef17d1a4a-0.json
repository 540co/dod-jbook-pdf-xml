            "val": "Intelligence Advanced Development (IAD) develops and demonstrates technology required to support warfighter needs for timely all source intelligence information. IAD supports global awareness, consistent battlespace knowledge, precision information, and the execution of time critical missions. IAD focuses on enhancing defense intelligence capabilities through exploration and development of innovative tools including data analytics for mining and exploitation, machine-learning, and software automation.  IAD projects provide improved on-time information to the warfighter using new and existing data sources, streamlining data analysis, thus reducing the footprint required, and enhancing performance. These support the Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) Contested\/Congested Degraded Operations (CDO) problem set. The Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site, Information Intelligence Systems and Analysis Division (AFRL\/RIE), works directly with users, employing evolutionary approaches and integrating finished modules directly into the field. The programs are oriented toward specific shortfalls and deficiencies as documented by the Major Commands (MAJCOMS), Unified Commands, and intelligence organizations in their mission and functional area plans. This PE expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational users via rapid prototyping. It is focused on technology insertion to correct AF intelligence deficiencies at the tactical and operational levels. The PE bridges the transition of new technologies from Advance Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Integrated Technology Thrust Programs (ITTPs) into current\/new systems, and supports the associated Defense Technology Objectives (DTOs). IAD may also reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new\/updated warfighter requirements.\n\nRequirements for this PE are identified and prioritized by Air Combat Command (ACC). Development of new\/improved capabilities to meet the requirements are managed by AFRL\/RIE. Prototype products, usually in the form of software, are provided to users in incremental capability spirals for operational environment evaluation.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Intelligence Advanced Development capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

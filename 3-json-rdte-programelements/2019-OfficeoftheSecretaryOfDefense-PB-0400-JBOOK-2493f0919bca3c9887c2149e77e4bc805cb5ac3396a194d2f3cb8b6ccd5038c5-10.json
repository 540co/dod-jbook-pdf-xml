These capabilities include enhanced mobility for terrestrial signals intelligence (SIGINT), aerial and ground tactical EW systems, radio frequency interference mitigation, EW common visualization and planning tools, improved direction finding, and distributed dismounted EW systems.  Each of these technologies were tested in individual and integrated technical assessments with warfighter participation.  The prototypes leveraged partners from Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and industry.  Using FY 2017 funding, the capabilities individually transitioned to several programs of record in FY 2018 including Prophet; Terrestrial Layer Support (TLS) to Multi-Domain Battle\/Joint Combined Arms Maneuver; Multi-Function Electronic Warfare Air-Large; and, EW Planning and Management Tool."

Current Army systems lack a common, integrated PNT capability to enable free maneuver in an anti-assess\/area denial (A2\/AD) environment.  The PNT prototype system uses an enhanced defense GPS receiver (DAGR) device (ED3) with a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) accessory module to integrate multiple global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers; an embedded chip-scale atomic clock for independent timing; and, a native inertial navigation unit (INU) to provide a cross-checking reference signal.  The project developed platform-specific interfaces to integrate these COTS systems into the Abrams, Bradley, Paladin, and Stryker tactical vehicle platforms.  Using FY 2017 funds, additional platform integration, safety testing, technical assessment, and operational demonstrations with the warfighter will be completed in FY 2018.  The PNT prototype system and demonstrations informed senior Army leadership and transitioned to the Army PM PNT portfolio; Assured PNT, Mounted; and, Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) programs of record."

The counter sUAS system integrated an all-passive sensor suite including acoustic sensors, wide-area electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) cameras, and high-speed EO and IR inspection cameras.  This prototype capability was developed to address shortfalls in the ability of currently deployed counter-UAS systems to detect emerging classes of targets.  The project also developed an open architecture fusion engine that correlates and classifies threats to alert an operator to sUAS incursions more rapidly than current systems.  Using FY 2017 funding, the prototype system was demonstrated against Class 1 and 2 UASs in a variety of operational environments in FY 2018.  This project directly supports a U.S. Strategic Command Joint Emerging Operational Need and a U.S. Central Command Joint Urgent Operational Need.  After a successful demonstration, the capability will transition to the Service and joint rapid capability fielding programs in support of multiple counter-sUAS efforts."

Prior to S2ME2, the Marine Corps did not have the equipment, training, or concept-of-operations (CONOPS) to operate in the increasingly non-permissive maritime domain.  This effort matured and demonstrated a subset of technologies identified in the S2ME2 2017 Advanced Naval Technology Exercise, which were validated at the Bold Alligator and Dawn Blitz 2017 exercises.  Specifically, S2ME2 focused on seven technology thrusts with disruptive potential: 1) Long Range Littoral Reconnaissance: Unmanned capabilities to safely increase the reach and situational awareness of individual Marines; 2) Unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR-T): Maturation of an existing commercial vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for shipboard operations; 3) Unmanned Fire Support: Precision fire support with autonomous magazines deployed from off shore staging forces; 4) Coalition Tactical Awareness and Response (CTAR): Extension of commercial satellite services to the Regiment level; 5) Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution (4GLTE) Long Range Communications: Modified commercial technology to provide ship-to-ship high bandwidth communications; 6) Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-jam Steerable Parasitic Array: A novel, low size, weight, power, and cost GPS antenna array with the ability to null jammers; and 7) Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection\/Anti-Jam Communications: Replacement of omni-directional communications with tracked and targeted communication links.  For each thrust, S2ME2 investigated emerging and mature government and commercial technologies; developed requirements; integrated technologies on operational systems for relevant demonstrations; explored improved CONOPS; and, informed senior Navy and Marine Corps leadership on future procurement and training needs.  Following a series of live tests and field demonstrations, the S2ME2 project transitioned to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps."

The second HPM prototype, Counter Cruise Missile Extended Range Air Base Air Defense (ABAD), is designed to deliver sufficient power levels to negate cruise missile threats.  Both systems provide a low cost per shot and a deep magazine.  The HPM for ABAD project conducted risk mitigation for both prototype systems optimizing size, weight, and power; developed hardware and software solutions to increase lethality; validated desired effects; and, integrated subsystems for demonstration.  The two prototypes were technically and operationally assessed at multiple facilities with military operators.  The HPM prototypes will transition to the Air Force and Navy and will provide capabilities to the U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Strategic Command."

With FY 2017 funds, the MRT system was technically assessed and demonstrated in FY 2018 with intel operators and instructors using real world scenarios, while also validating training scenarios specifically desired by the USPACOM JIOC TSTC.  The MTR reached initial operational capability at the U.S. PACOM JIOC TSTC and transitioned to U.S. PACOM JIOC.  MTR was developed to support U.S. PACOM\u2019s JIOC TSTC cell specific training needs, but the capability is extensible to the TST cells in other Combatant Commands.

            "val": "This program supports Department of Defense (DoD) priorities for demonstrations in hypersonics and manned\/unmanned systems, respectively. This effort integrates and demonstrates advanced flight vehicle technologies that improve the performance and supportability of existing and future aerospace vehicles. System level integration brings together aerospace vehicle technologies along with avionics, propulsion, and weapon systems for demonstration in a near-realistic operational environment. Integration and technology demonstrations reduce the risk and time required to transition technologies into operational aircraft. Projects in this program have been coordinated through the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design. \n\nIn FY 2021, Project 634920, Flight Vehicle Tech Integration, and Project 634927, Aerospace Power & Flight Control Integ & Demo, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under these Projects will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634926, High Speed Systems Integ & Demo, will be transferred from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platforms Dev\/Demo.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Skyborg Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards. These transfers are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated Non-Vanguard efforts and activities will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The JTN was formed upon the descoping of the Joint Tactical Radio System development program (PE 0604280F).  JTN will provide interoperable, secure Joint Tactical Networking applications capable of operating in a variety of radio solutions to maintain and sustain an affordable, government-controlled open architecture, in support of Combatant Commanders', Services' and Coalition mission network requirements.  JTN is responsible for the continuous development, delivery, and maintenance of networking waveforms and modified legacy radio waveforms that are Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant. SCA compliant waveforms enable interoperability and support Net-Centric operational warfare at sea, in the air and on the ground.  Networking waveforms extend the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the first tactical mile and to the warfighter. \n\nThe JTN team is responsible for (1) the overall management and oversight of the Waveforms contained in the JTN repository; (2) development, validation, and evolution of a common JTN SCA; (3) development and evolution of waveform software applications for tactical radios; (4) development of software cryptographic algorithms and equipment applications (Information Assurance); (5) development and evolution of the JTN networking and network management software components, Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM); (6) testing and certification of JTN waveforms, network services, and network management; and, (7) full lifecycle support of waveforms and networking applications in order to maintain a robust industry base of radio vendors.\n\nThe individual services provide 1\/3 each of funding to support activities of the JTN.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate-rate production."

The JTN was formed upon the descoping of the Joint Tactical Radio System development program (PE 0604280F).  JTN will provide interoperable, secure Joint Tactical Networking applications capable of operating in a variety of radio solutions to maintain and sustain an affordable, government-controlled open architecture, in support of Combatant Commanders', Services' and Coalition mission network requirements.  JTN is responsible for the continuous development, delivery, and maintenance of networking waveforms and modified legacy radio waveforms that are Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant. SCA compliant waveforms enable interoperability and support Net-Centric operational warfare at sea, in the air and on the ground.  Networking waveforms extend the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the first tactical mile and to the warfighter"
